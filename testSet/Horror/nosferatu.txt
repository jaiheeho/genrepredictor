Scene [2] 3
Fade-in.
Outside a window.	4 meters 2x
There are flowers in green window-boxes. On the window sill a kitten is playing in the morning sun. With graceful movements she tries to catch a ball that dangles from a thread. Now the ball is being pulled in through the window. The cat jumps in after it.

Scene [3] 4
[Small neat kitchen]	Ellen's sitting room 7 meters 2x
The morning sun casts the shadow of a window frame onto the floor. Ellen, by the window, is pulling in the thread with the ball, the cat follows it with a leap. Then she puts the little animal on her arm. Playing with it she sits down on the window sill bathed in sunshine and looks out dreamily. She squats on the floor opposite the animal and plays with it. Her dressing gown moves in the breeze, her big childlike eyes are laughing.
Scene [4] 3a	20 meters Hutter . white jabot . blue waist coat
[Poor looking and tidy. A bed], a chair in period style. Hutter is standing in front of the mirror. He is about to put his jacket on. He pauses to listen, takes a look through the side window. Smiling happily he finishes dressing and goes out.
4a A small flower garden [in front of Hutter's house].	Shot from above. Hutter appears, gardening knife in hand, looks up beaming with joy. He finds a clump of carnations, cuts the flowers with a quick gesture and makes a bouquet.
Scene 5 
(The small kitchen)	Ellen's room 18 meters 2x 
Ellen, still playing with the kitten, hears Hutter coming and jumps up.
[Shot of cooker.	Ellen comes over and begins to busy herself with the sauce pans, with a childlike earnestness towards her housewifely duties.]
Shot of door:	Hutter is standing in the door-way and laughs and laughs; hiding the bouquet behind his back, he laughs and laughs.
Shot of cooker:	[Ellen turns round, catches sight of her husband and seems a little ashamed that she hasn't yet made breakfast. Now Hutter moves closer to her, looks into the sauce-pan, holds it upside down indicating that it is empty, and looks at her reproachfully.
Title:	Ellen!
She is sulking now and trying to placate him. But he pulls out his watch; it is late already; he has to go. He kisses her goodbye, but she calls him back again to confess that she hasn't got any money left to do the shopping. He pulls out his purse with a sad look and holds it up: there is nothing in it! They both sigh. He leaves with a heavy heart. The moment she is alone she takes a small basket of potatoes, which is all she can find, the last resort of the poor housewife, and starts peeling them. A potato drops on the floor, the kitten comes up and plays with it.]
Fade-out.	
Long shot:	They are rushing towards each other, Ellen throws herself 
into Hutter's arms.
He produces the bouquet, 
hands it to her beaming all over his face. 
She is touched then, saddening, she takes the flowers 
looking at the stems and stroking them. His voice 
asks for the reasons of her behavior.
She says:
Title:	Why have you killed them ... 
...the beautiful flowers?
Hutter is taken aback for a moment. 
He apologizes and kisses her. Then she forgives 
him, they stand in an embrace.
Fade-out.	2x
Scene 5a
Fade-in.
Street with front gardens.	10 meters Lauenburg.
Title:	Professor Bulwer.
Professor Bulwer is walking vigorously, yet slowly along the road, enjoying the morning and the sunshine. His stick strikes the ground energetically.
Suddenly he stops and turns round. Who is following him in such haste? Isn't it Hutter? He grasps the passing man by his sleeve; he holds on to it. Hutter greets him, looking pleased. Bulwer laughs and, looking deep into his eyes, says:
Title:	Why so hasty, my young friend? One reaches one's goal soon enough.
Hutter, of course, doesn't understand him. He has to get to the office quickly. He greets him again and again. Until he manages at last to break free with a laugh and rushes off. 
Bulwer stands there for a moment, then he resumes the regular rhythm of his walk.
Scene 6
Fade-in.
Dusty cramped office.	6 meters Caption: Knock - a house agent
Pale light is falling through tiny blind window-panes into the strange room which is eccentrically decorated with bits of old-fashioned furniture. Knock is standing at a high desk. People call him a house agent.
Close-up:	Knock's spindly hunch-backed figure. Gray hair, weather-beaten face full of wrinkles. Around his mouth throbs the ugly tic of the epileptic. In his eyes burns a somber fire. He is reading a letter.
Close-up:	The letter. On a sheet of paper decorated on the margin with grotesque vignettes a medley of intricate and quite illegible signs.
Medium close-up:	Knock seems to be able to make sense of the strange letter, for his ugly mouth sets into an understanding smile. Then he turns and opens a door.
Scene 7
Small room adjoining the office.	5 meters
Very narrow and dark, totally without sun. Hutter, buried in files. Knock looks through the door and calls him in. Another clerk is present.
Scene 8 
The dusty and cramped office.	30 meters
Knock and Hutter enter; Knock points to the letter with mysterious gestures and tells Hutter:
Title:	Count Orlok - His Grace ... From Transylvania ... wants to buy ... a beautiful house ... in our little town.
Close-up:	Knock's demonic face with wide-open eyes.
Title:	You could make a nice bit of money ... It will take some effort, however. .. a few drops of sweat and [blood] ... perhaps a little blood.
Close-up:	In Hutter's face expressions of mounting joy and strange apprehension are fighting each other. Yet joy wins in the end.
Long shot:	Knock digs up an old atlas from the depths of the cabinet and opens it. His finger runs over a page:
Close-up:	The route from England to Transylvania on the map.
Long shot:	Transylvania? asks Hutter, his eyes suddenly shining at the thought of a journey. Yet Knock has turned back to the letter, now reading the back page.
Close-up:	The back page of the letter, covered with the same illegible squiggles.
Long shot:	Knock seems to be able to make sense of this page too, he turns back to Hutter who is already day-dreaming about his journey.
Title:	He wants a handsome deserted house.
For a moment Knock is lost in thought, then he has an idea. He limps over to the window.
Scene 9
Section of a window. 
Dissolve.	4 meters Window frame, take in Knock
View down the street.
The deserted house. A dilapidated façade. Black and hollow windows. Not a sign of life. Shadows on it.
Daytime - Sun
Scene 10
The dusty and cramped office.	15 meters 
Knock walks back from the window and says to Hutter:
Title:	That house ...
just opposite yours. Offer 
him that!
Hutter seems to be a little taken aback, but he rallies round quickly. Knock urges him to set out on the journey at once, hands him some money and documents and pushes him to the door.
Fade-out.	
Scene 11
(A room in Hutter's house)
Ellen's room.	18 meters 2x As in scene 8
Ellen is sitting by the window. Now she can see him coming. She waves to him. Her face lights up with joy. She hurries over to the door. Presently Hutter enters. Moved and happy, he puts his arms round her and tells her his great news:
Title:	I shall go on a journey far far away ...
to the country of [blood-red] mountains where 
there are bandits and ghosts still.
Ellen is startled. A shadow passes over her forehead. She wants to hold him back. But he is not listening. He has got to pack; already he is leaving her.
Fade-out.	
Scene 12
The attic room.
Fade-in.	15 meters Frau Schroeder without shawl . saddlebags
Hutter is packing his little traveling bag. Ellen appears in the door behind him. Suddenly she starts to beg him tearfully, entreatingly: Do not go! I am worried about you! But he rejects her remonstrations. Now he has finished packing. He gets up. Ellen, realizing that he has made up his mind steps back, resigning herself. But there is fear in her eyes. Seeing her like this he hesitates for a moment. But then he embraces her again with determination, takes up his bag and leaves the room with her.

Fade-out.	
Scene 13
(Lord) Harding's park.	15 meters
Hutter, all ready for the journey, takes his leave from Harding and his sister Anny. Ellen, weeping, is supported by Anny.

Title:	I entrust Ellen to your care.
Harding promises his friend to look after Ellen, she can live here, she will never be alone.
Long-shot of all the characters.	Hutter gives his hand to Anny and then to Ellen. One last farewell kiss. [At this moment her grief is over. As if she had a premonition she says:
Title:	Farewell! There is no escape left.
At first they are all startled by these words.] Then Hutter breaks away. Another farewell, another wave of the hand and Hutter vanishes into the park. Ellen is staring vacantly into the distance.
Scene 14
Square with fountain.	10 meters saddle bags
A number of healthy-looking people are walking about in the sunshine. Tied to the fountain a lonely, saddled horse. Hutter appears, mounts the horse, gives one last backward look and gallops off.

Scene 17
Inside the inn.	8 meters servant: Frau Kurz
A large smoky room with an enormous tiled stove. A central hanging lamp throws out dazzling light. At tables in the background the passengers. Hutter, who came in last, is standing in the foreground, he looks around and sits down right in front. At once the old servant approaches with a glass and puts it down in front of him. He overcomes a strange anxiety that was brought on by the evening mood in a strange country and puts on a sudden show of liveliness. He knocks on the table and says:
Title:	Quickly, my meal - [and then]
I must be off to Count Orlok's castle.
The servant recoils in horror. The strangely identical-looking passengers, sitting in the background, rise up abruptly to stare at him.
Shot of bar:	The old hunch-backed Jew pricks up his ears.
Long shot:	Hutter looks around in embarrassment, then takes up his glass resolutely and downs it at one gulp.
Scene 18
A grassy slope behind the inn.	4 meters Walddorfsenke
The ground falls away towards the back. Night mists are creeping up from the valley. The horses are put out here to graze. Suddenly, they raise their heads, as if frightened and, scattering, gallop away.
Scene 19
Inside the inn.
Shot of window:	8 meters
The passengers, seen from behind, are standing by the window, looking out apprehensively. The old servant has not got the courage to go up to where they stand and makes the sign of the cross. Hutter stands alone, looking around. He is perplexed and wants to ask what is happening. The old servant comes up to him and whispers into his ear.

Title:	You mustn't go
there now, there are wolves about.
Spend the night here.
Hutter understands and decides to stay.

Scene 21 is missing from the script.	
Scene 22
Inside the inn.	5 meters
The pale passengers, now without Hutter in the enormous room, look frightened. They, too, are listening to the horrible howling. They look at each other and are crossing themselves in terror!
Scene 23
The tiny white-washed room.	20 meters
In the light of the candle Hutter, shivering, closes the window. He is no longer sleepy. He walks up and down the room restlessly, stopping in front of a little bookcase.
Medium close-up.	Looking for something to distract him Hutter pulls out a book at random.
Long shot.	He moves back to the candle, sits down on his bed and opens the book. He gets interested in it.

Shot of bed. Close-up:	Hutter, shaking his head, continues reading.

Fade-in.
The small white room at the inn.	12 meters

Close-up:	VAMPIRE

The old servant, mother to all animals, throws corn to her chickens. There are sparrows, too. Everything is bathed in sunlight.
Scene 28
Outside the inn.	10 meters
The bustle of departure. The horses are in harness. The passengers have got into the coach. Now, in the morning light, one can see their differences. They are much less uniform than they had seemed the previous nightfall. They are chattering noisily to the people who are staying behind and with the peasants and nosy children who are gathered around the coach.
Close-up:	The coachman is about to climb onto his seat, but the small Jewish inn-keeper holds him back: one passenger is missing. They look up to the windows: angry about the delay the coachman cracks his whip a few times.

Scene 29

Fade-out.

The mail coach is moving into the setting sun.

Medium close-up:	A coach window. [An old woman] Hutter leans out, giving the coachman a push with an umbrella.

Scene 32
A rocky gorge.	4 meters View from Schlesische Hütte
Wisps of mist are rising and falling in the last rays of the setting sun. Patches of sun and shade.
Fade-out.	
Scene 33	10 meters Close to Arler Hütte
Title:	At the crossroad.
[A carved madonna casts a long shadow across the road. Behind it an old woman on her knees, deep in prayer. She lifts her head and looks down the road.] The mail coach approaches, the horses are pulling with difficulty, breathing hard. She seems to ask herself: do they want to drive to the haunted castle? and gets into the middle of the road to warn them off. The mail coach stops. Hutter gets off the coach box. Now he stands at the crossroad. The passengers are anxious to move on, gesturing violently to him not to take the left fork. But Hutter disregards their shouting. He waves farewell with his hat and walks briskly off.
33a	Hutter walking past the carved madonna.
Scene 34
Distant mountains.	8 meters Vratna Pass
View through the cut made into the rock by the road into the far distance. In the background the fantastic castle of Count Orlok in the evening light. One can see a steep road leading straight up into the sky. Something comes racing down. A coach? A phantom? It moves with unearthly speed and disappears behind a ground-swell.
1) Castle Orlok, dissolve with 
2) Steep road between boulders	
Scene 35
At the crossroad.
Angle as in Scene 33:	4 meters Near Schlesische Hütte
Mortally frightened, the coachman beats his horses. [The old woman has disappeared as if swallowed up by the ground.] Astonished, Hutter follows the vanishing coach with his eyes. He is all alone now, standing like this for a while. Then he pulls himself together and walks resolutely along the road on the left.

Fade-out.	
Scene 36
Fade-in.
Carpathian virgin forest.	Vratna Pass
The trees are casting long shadows on the forest path. Hutter appears.

He halts: what's that? Something comes racing up, turns round as if moved by a hidden force and moving jerkily. Stops dead. Hutter likewise. A black carriage. No wheels? Two black horses - griffins? Their legs are invisible, covered by a black funeral cloth. Their eyes like pointed stars. Puffs of steam from their open mouths, revealing white teeth. The coachman is wrapped up in black cloth. His face pale as death. His eyes are staring at Hutter. Raising his whip he makes an inviting, almost commanding gesture. He waits. Hutter cannot rally enough strength to follow the invitation. Yet those eyes assert their power. Step by step, as if pulled by invisible threads, Hutter approaches the uncanny creature. He gets into the carriage. It reverses quick as lightning, dashes off and disappears.

Scene 37
A fairy-tale forest.	5 meters At the Vratna Pass, behind Tyer Hora
Empty. By the roadside a wise, man-sized raven. Its shoulders hunched up. It turns its head listening. Then takes two hops forward and looks down the road. Who's coming? The familiar vehicle sweeps up and past. A young man, holding on desperately, sits inside, looking terrified. [It] The raven follows him with mocking eyes behind glasses. Coach drives at top speed through a white forest!
Scene 38
Long shot of a snake-like bend.	5 meters
[Valley] Deserted lane. Only a lonely twisted willow-tree with a straggly top can be seen. Again, the carriage races past. Like an ancient man who has been disturbed in his rest the tree looks after the vehicle with blank eyes. Isn't there a grin on its mouth?
Drive over stone bridge across deep gorge.
Scene 39
Count Orlok's castle.
39a	15 meters Poczamok
The arch of a gate in the shade. The silhouette of the carriage drives underneath it at a sharp angle and disappears in the moonlit spacious castle yard.

Shot of castle yard.
Medium close-up:	The porch. The carriage stops in front of it. Almost in a faint, Hutter slides down. As if in a whirlpool, the carriage circles round him and disappears. Hutter turns round and follows it with his eyes. He stands in front of the closed gate, holding his bag.
39b	Then, very very slowly the two wings of the gate open up. Somewhere far back in the dark corridor a man can be seen standing motionless. He is holding a candle which lights up his chalk white face. He is waiting. Who is that? Hutter bounds up the two steps and stands in the doorway. He would still like to go back. Yet it is too late now. Hesitantly he walks towards the stranger. Behind him the gates close.
Fade-out.	

Act II
Scene 40 
Hall.
Medium close-up:	
In the center Orlok, the candle in his hand. The walls of the hall are plunged in darkness from which Hutter's back emerges. He faces the motionless figure. Is this pale, ghostly creature with hollow eyes and thin mouth the lord of the castle himself?

Close-up:	The face twists into a polite grimace. Sharp ratlike teeth appear over the lower lip.
Medium close-up:	They are now face to face. It must be the count for this is no servant's gesture with which he now takes hold of his visitor's bag.
Title:	The servants are asleep. 
It is almost [after] midnight.
Hutter's clenched fingers let go. Bag in hand, Orlok turns round. He holds up the candle and walks ahead. Hutter follows.
Scene 41 
Gallery of ancestors' portraits.
Medium close-up:	One of the castle owner's ancestors, frontal view. [For centuries he has been asleep like this with his eyes closed. Now something approaches. His eyes begin to move.] Two figures are passing: Orlok and his visitor.
Long-shot panorama:	He follows them with his eyes. They walk close to the wall where portrait follows portrait.
Omitted.
Scene 42 
Dining room.	25 meters
Gigantic dimensions. In the center a massive Renaissance table. Somewhere in the distance a fire place. Flanked by two armored figures. Black and motionless. In olden times, this must have been used by knights for their drinking bouts. Are these things their armor? Is that long line that runs across the wall a crack in the old structure? Or a lance left hanging there? Suddenly, Hutter notices that the count is waiting. Quickly he hands him the plans of the deserted house and Knock's letters. With a smile Orlok takes them and begs him to take a seat. The meal is waiting. Hutter sits down. Orlok lifts up the papers and studies them.
Close-up:	Orlok reading. The back page of the letter shows a confusion of numbers, legible and illegible letters. The holy number seven is repeated several times. In between, cabbalistic signs. The spindly fingers holding the letter cover up the rest like claws.
Close-up:	Hutter is spell-bound, his eyes wide-open.
Close-up:	Over the top margin of the letter Orlok's eyes appear. He is looking over to Hutter like a snake about to hypnotize its victim.
Close-up:	Hutter eating. He puts a morsel into his mouth. He lifts up his eyes. His look turns into a stare. He is unable to swallow.
Long shot:	The hall with the halo of light in the center; the figures are looming above the table.
Close-up:	An antique clock with a pendulum. A hammer strikes the hour. The big hand points to 12 o'clock.
Medium close-up:	Hutter staring into space as if transfixed. After the twelfth stroke he drops his knife and fork. The knife grazes his hand, it is bleeding.
Medium close-up:	Quick as lightning the count rushes up to him offering his help. He prevents Hutter from wiping off the blood. The knife might have been poisoned. [The sticky blood should be removed from the cut.] His lips are sucking at the hand [hastily]. Frightened, Hutter pulls away his hand from his grip. He moves backwards towards the fireplace.
Medium close-up:	By the fireplace. The count is polite; he has lost his ghostlike appearance. He is asking for something in a friendly, almost sad manner.
Title:	Shall we stay up together 
for a little while? It's a 
long time to go till sunrise ...
And during the day I am always out and about.
The count sits down. And Hutter cannot resist his chivalrous manner. He sinks back into the massive chair.
Scene 43
Fade-in.
The same hall.	18 meters
Hutter wakes up in the large armchair near the fireplace. He can hardly remember the events of the night. The armchair opposite seems to be empty. But there is light on it. Hutter's gaze wanders across the hall over to the window.

Shot of window:	It is very high and divided up into small panes. Morning light is streaming in.
Shot as before:	An old-fashioned window. An ancient hall, very dusty. Nothing strange about it. Hutter yawns. His eyes fall on the cut in his hand and he remembers a few more things. What has he got on his neck? He touches his throat. Must have been mosquitoes. A mirror! His bag is nearby on the floor. He takes out his mirror and looks at his neck.
Close-up:	The mirror shows two red spots on his neck, very close together.
Normal close-up:	Why should he worry about a few little spots? he thinks and puts the mirror away. He yawns once more. But suddenly he stops. What's this? He looks at the table, astonished.
Close-up:	A still-life of food: fruit, a joint, all kinds of gastronomic delicacies.
Normal:	He is overjoyed. He rushes over to the table and begins to eat as if he were starved.
Scene 44 
The dilapidated terrace.	22 meters Poczamok
Still eating, Hutter steps out into the sunlight. He looks around, ? seeming relaxed. He holds a sheet of paper and a pencil in his hands. Then he casts about for a suitable place and, leaning against the stone wall, he begins to write a letter.
Close-up:	The beginning of the letter: My dearest, my only one ...
Normal:	Hutter stands upright, looking at the clouds. Why does that stupid mosquito buzzing round his nose stop him from concentrating? He catches it quickly. And now he knows how to continue. He puts pencil to paper again:
Close-up:	Part of the letter: ... the mosquitoes are a real pest. I have been stung at the neck by two at once, very close together, one on each side ...
Long shot:	Hutter continues writing.
Scene 45 
Forest near the castle.	14 meters Poczamok
A man on horseback is approaching. He stops occasionally and peers over to the castle as if he were scared of it.
Outside the porch.	Hutter stands there, waving with the letter. The rider comes up cautiously and takes the letter without dismounting. Then he dashes off at a gallop showing signs of great fear.
Scene 46 
Fade-in.
Dining room.	15 meters
Orlok is sitting by the fireplace bent over some plans. Hutter is standing behind him. Orlok shows more interest in the young man than in the papers lying in front of him. Looking over his shoulder he asks for some more information. Hutter rummages among the papers in his bag. A little picture falls on the table. He wants to hide it quickly, yet Orlok was quicker. He has picked it up and is looking at it.

Close-up:	A miniature portrait of Ellen.
Medium close-up:	Orlok asks about the person in the picture. And Hutter is forced to answer him.
Close-up:	Orlok's eyes open wide. His lips look even thinner than before. Contemplating the picture he whispers:
Title:	What a beautiful throat your wife has ...
Medium close-up:	Hutter is breathing hard. The fear which grips him in the count's presence is replaced by a sudden fear for his wife. He forgets himself and reaches for the miniature. For the first time he touches Orlok's body. The count jumps up. He raises himself to his full height with triumphant determination and a glazed look in his eyes, and says, anticipating the horrors to come with pleasure:
Title:	I shall buy the house ...
The handsome deserted house opposite yours ...
Quickly, he takes up the contract and signs it. He hands it back to Hutter. Hutter bows uneasily and retires. Orlok watches him go, a satanic look has come into his eyes. His hands have turned into claws.
Hutter takes his bag with him

Scene 47
Fade-in.
A small room in the castle.	15 meters
A candle is burning
Hutter is standing in the middle of the room, quite dazed. He shakes off his misgivings. He decides to leave to-morrow. He kisses the picture and starts to undress, when to his amazement he discovers a book in his pocket. The old book from the inn. Did the inn-keeper's wife put it there? Mechanically, he opens it.
Close-up:	The book.
Chapter II.
Night is the vampire's element.
He can see in the dark 
which is a wonderful ability to have in this world, 
half of which is night.
We humans, however, are helpless and blind at night ...
Normal:	Hutter shuts the book. A horrible thought has occurred to him. He is feverish. Is it this book, these ancient walls which make him believe in the existence of ghosts? Did not the count seem to have vampire-like claws and rat's teeth? He jumps up, first running, then sneaking to the door.
Scene 48 
Dining hall.
View from door deep into the dining hall.	4 meters
By the fireplace Count Orlok, no, not Orlok but a gigantic vampire, a motionless, somber watcher in the night.

Scene 49
The small room.
Shot of door:	6 meters
Hutter. He supports himself against the doorpost. A terrible realization has dawned on him. Shut the door, shut it quickly! There is no bolt. No lock. He looks around, puts the heavy oak chair against the door. Is it possible to escape?

Medium close-up:	Window. Hutter rushes up and flings it open.
Scene 50	3 meters Tegeler Forest

Scene 51
The small room.
Long shot:	8 meters
Hutter falls on his knees by the side of the bed. Hands clutching the bedclothes, he stares at the door behind which the horror is waiting. 
What is this?

Medium close-up:	Moved by an invisible hand the door opens to half its width in one single jerk.
Long shot:	Hutter. Terrified, he covers his eyes with his arms, pulls at the bedclothes and shields his eyes. He mustn't see it. He mustn't look!
Fade-out.

They open the lid with difficulty. There is earth [sand] inside! The inspector gives another order: turn it out! The workers obey. [Sand is falling out] ... nothing but [sand] earth.
Satisfied, the inspector turns to another pile of cargo. 
Yet in the sand... something moves violently ... something is alive ...jumps out ... horrible animals ... rats!!
One of the dock-workers, who bends over to scoop the scattered sand back, hits out violently. Did not one of the animals ... reeling from the blow ... bite his foot?

Like a panther preparing to leap, his ferocity restrained, he raises himself up slowly. His crazed burning eyes staring at Sievers. And now we recognize him at last ... it is Knock!!!
Suddenly, in one leap, he is at the window. Sievers is startled, says something to the attendant. Who prepares the straitjacket he brought along.
Yet the expected attack does not come.
Knock remains at the window, arms jerking, he begins ... to catch flies which he puts into his mouth. Horrible food. The madman's face twists into a grin that resembles distant lightning. His swollen lips are murmuring something:
Title:	Blood is life! Blood is life!!!!
Suddenly, the madman starts up and throws himself with all his might on the unsuspecting Sievers. Who can barely ward him off. But the attendant comes to his help quickly and throws the straitjacket over the raging man's head.

Gladly and quickly, Anny takes over. You'll see, he is safe and sound and sends you good news. She starts to read it, gives a joyful laugh, she was right. All is well. The worries were unfounded. Happily she gives Ellen the letter.
But barely has she read the letter when Ellen's face assumes an expression of hurt certainty. Does she derive evil premonitions from these lines?

In a stupor, Knock is perching on his bunk. The attendant, holding a broom, is about to leave the cell.
At this moment Knock lifts his eyes. With a look of artful cunning and with rigid concentration he follows the attendant's movements. Now, he seems to have discovered an opportunity; softly, he sneaks up on the unsuspecting man and takes away the newspaper that sticks out of his pocket. The attendant does not notice and shuts the door behind him. The moment Knock is alone he unfolds the paper [trembling with expectancy] and starts reading [searching for something] with wide-open eyes. [Now he has found what he was looking for. He is riveted to this passage:]
Close-up:	The Newspaper. P L A G U E 
In Transylvania and in the Black Sea ports of Varna and Galaz a plague epidemic has started. Young women in particular fall victim to it in large numbers. All the victims show the same peculiar wound marks on the neck whose origin is still an enigma to the doctors.

Medium close-up:	The captain, more angry than concerned, advises the patient in his uncouth sailor's way to have a strong drink. 
Promptly, the mate produces his bottle and gives it to the patient. The smell seems to wake him up from his lethargy and he takes a long sip. The captain tells him to have a good rest and goes out again with the mate. 
The sailor alone. His eyes are wandering ...
Suddenly, they remain fixed, as if spellbound, on the door leading to the hold.
In horror he sits up and remains in a crouching position as if turned to stone.

Shot of ship's side:	The corpse is slid down into the water by ropes.
On deck.	For a moment the two last survivors pause in quiet contemplation of the horror of death. Suddenly, the mate's body stiffens, he has made a resolution. For a short moment, he shuts his eyes and tries to master the horror that is rising up inside him. Then he pulls himself together, tears the cloth off his face, takes up an axe and, brandishing it in the air, calls out:
Title:	I'm going down!!! 
If I haven't come back 
in ten minutes...
With the courage of a desperate man he hurries over to the companion-way.

Another box, smashed by a second blow. And the same thing happens again: rats! only rats! He is wading through wriggling bodies which surround him from all sides. Yet he withstands the horror. There, a third box.

The captain watches in horror. Now he is left all alone. But his face remains determined. He picks up a rope and ties himself to the helm, not to be tempted to leave it. Thus he awaits the horror ...
