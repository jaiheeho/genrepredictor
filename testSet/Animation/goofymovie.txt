TITLE SCREEN

"A Movie" appears in a formal typeface while a bold fanfare
plays in the background, suddenly the characteristic red
polygon logo appears and the letters GOOFY fly on the screen,
knocking the formal title askew and accompanied by the
trademark "Goofy" scream. The orchestra responds with a soft,
condescending chord.

EXT. WHEAT FIELD

The movie logo scrolls upward off the blue background, and
soft clouds follow - smoothing the transition. The camera
continues to pan downward until it comes to rest on a vast,
golden wheat field. The wheat is blowing gently in a wind.
The orchestra continues with soft, majestic music that fits
the wheat field scenery.

ROXANNE (V.O.)
Ma-ax...

MAX pops into view, very close to the camera, looking
disoriented.

MAX
Huh?

ROXANNE
Ma-ax...

The calls continue and Max looks into the screen, squinting.
Roxanne appears in the distance, sitting on a pillar. Max
begins pushing his way through the wheat, making his way to
Roxanne.

Finally, he emerges in a clearing beneath the pedestal Roxanne
is sitting on.

MAX
Roxanne?

She turns to him and blows on the dandelion she is holding,
and they brush against Max's face. Max chuckles. She jumps
off the pedestal and floats gracefully down toward Max. He
reaches out to catch her, but loses his balance, and both
tumble lightly to the ground. They lie on the ground briefly,
watching the clouds and laughing. Then, turning to each other,
they exchange meaningful glances. Slowly, as the music builds
to a climax, they draw closer to kiss, but just as they are
about to, Roxanne recoils in fear. The background changes
from a pristine wheat field to a nightmarish tangle of thorns,
and the music changes accordingly.

MAX
(surprised)
What?

Max looks down to find that his two front teeth have become
huge. Max stiffens and watches in horror as his feet grow
equally huge, bursting through his shoes. Roxanne backs away,
terrified. Standing, Max's hands burst through his gloves,
finger by finger, growing large and exaggerated. Max's entire
body grows, dwarfing Roxanne and the surrounding landscape.
His face changes, stretching and flattening, similar to
Goofy's. Finally the music builds and the camera pulls back
to reveal Max, now looking exactly like Goofy, standing in
the remains of his torn clothing. Max grabs his throat, but
is unable to stifle a harsh, terrible Goofy-laugh as the
music peaks.

INT. MAX'S BEDROOM

The music ends abruptly as Max wakes up, screaming, and sits
up straight in bed. He gasps repeatedly, but slowly calms
down. He feels his teeth with his fingers, then sighs in
relief. Just as he starts to relax, the phone rings loudly -
startling him. He grabs the phone and fumbles it, dropping
the receiver to the floor. He dives after it, and answers it
at floor level.

MAX
Hello?
(clearing throat and
repeating)
Hello?
PJ
Max? Where the heck are you, man?
MAX
PJ?
PJ
You should have been here an hour
ago!
MAX

What? Hold on...
(whacks clock, which
reveals actual time)
Oh no!

Max leaps from bed, leaving the receiver on the nightstand.
He grabs his pants from the back of a chair and attempts to
put them on quickly.

PJ
(from receiver on
nightstand)
Look, maybe we should just call the
whole thing off...

Max struggles with his pants, and grabs the receiver.

MAX
No way, man. It's now or never...whoa!

PJ
Well you'd better get a move on...I'll
meet you at my locker.

Max hangs up the phone, and his pants fall to the floor.
Suddenly, Goofy bursts in the door wrapped in a towel, with
another on his head.

GOOFY
Mornin', son!

MAX
(embarrassed)
Dad!

Max reaches down, and pulls his pants up in a huff.

GOOFY
Oops! Sorry...I forgot...

Goofy backs out of the room and closes the door behind him.
Immediately he knocks on the door and without waiting for an
answer, opens it again and repeats:

GOOFY
Mornin', son!...came to see if you
had any...dirty...clothes...

Max is running around the room, trying to gather his things
as quickly as possible. The room is cluttered, with clothes
and various items scattered everywhere.

MAX
Oh...there they are, help yourself.

GOOFY
(looking disdainfully
at the mess)
Max, I thought we talked about this...

MAX
Look, I'm sorry, Dad. I'll take care
of it later.

GOOFY
What's the big rush?

MAX
I'm running late.

GOOFY
Well, I can drop you off on the way
to work.

MAX
That's okay Dad, I...I need the
exercise.

Max pulls his shirt over his head, and continues grabbing
his things. Goofy begins vacuuming the floor of Max's room,
sucking up clothes and everything else in his path. Max is
about to leave when Goofy accidentally sucks up the head of
Max's life-size cardboard Powerline cutout. Max screams,
grabs the figure by its feet, and attempts to pull it out.
Finally, after wrestling with it for a moment, Max stomps
the power switch with his foot and the vacuum shuts off -
releasing the figure. He stands it up and sees that its head
is bent and its nose is twisted into a curl.

MAX
(sadly)
Dad! You ruined it...

GOOFY
Sorry about that....who was he,
anyway?

MAX
(sarcastically)
It's only Powerline, Dad...the biggest
rock star on the planet.

GOOFY
Oh...not bigger than Xavier Cougat,
the mambo king!

Goofy grabs Max and starts dancing around the room, with Max
flailing to escape.

GOOFY
Everybody mambo! Mambo, mambo,
mambo...

MAX
Dad!...Come on, there's no time for
this!...What if the neighbors see

us?

EXT. GOOFY'S FRONT YARD

Max escapes and heads out the door, leaving Goofy to his big
finish. Once outside, Goofy, clad in his towels, catches Max
and hands him a brown paper bag.

GOOFY
Maxie, wait up! You forgot your
lunch...have a good day.

To Max's chagrin, Goofy kisses him on the cheek - just as a
group of his classmates skateboard by. They laugh at him,

Max waves back, embarrassed and stomps toward the gate to
leave. As he leaves, an electric guitar riff begins the "After
Today" song.

MAX
They've been laughing since I can
remember, but they're not gonna laugh
anymore. No more "Maxie the Geek" no
more "Goof of the week" like before.

Max gets to the gate at the end of his yard and pushes it,
but it won't open.

After another unsuccessful attempt, he backs up to get a
running start and jumps over the gate. Once on the sidewalk,
he slips on marbles which some children were playing with.
GIRL: No more algebra tests till September.

Max, slipping on the marbles, bumps into the girl and her
boyfriend.

BOYFRIEND: No more lookin' at losers like him.
Her boyfriend grabs Max and tosses him aside.

KIDl
No more havin' ta cheat.

KID2
No more mystery meat.

Kid2 grabs Max's lunch as he walks by.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

Several other students on their way to school fling jockstraps
at each other and passersby, one of them hits Max in the

face.

KID3
No more gym.

KID4
No more gym.

KID5
No more gym.

KID6
(yelling)
No more gym!

CHAD'S GIRLFRIEND
Gonna move to the mall.

CHAD
Gonna live in the pool.

MAX
Gonna talk to Roxanne and not feel
like a fool, 'cause...

Chad's girlfriend punches Max in the arm. A group of students
on skateboards follow them up the street as they walk away.

ALL
After today I'm gonna be cruisin'.

MAX
After today she'll be mine.

ALL
After today my brains will be
snoozin'.

Max pops up behind several ladies on bus stop bench,
them.

MAX
If I don't faint, I'll be fine.

TWIN GIRLS
I've got forty more minutes of Home
Economics.

TWIN GUYS
Then down with the textbooks.

NERDY KIDS
And up with the comics.

startling

Max runs through a flock of pigeons, scaring them away.

MAX
Just think of all the time I've been
losin', finding the right thing to

MAX
say. But things will be going my
way, after today...

Max, in front of the music store, stops and waves at Roxanne
passing by. She doesn't see him and continues on. Max looks
turns away sadly, and looks into the music store and sees
Stacey and another girl looking starstruck at the Powerline
display.

MAX
She looked right through me, and who
could blame her. I need a new me,
plus some positive proof that I'm
not just a goof, and...

A school bus passes by, with filled with students including
Bobby and some cheerleaders.

CHORUS
After today I'm gonna be cruisin'.

GRUNGE GIRLS
No more pep rallies to cut - bleah!

CHORUS
After today my brains will be
snoozin'.

BUS DRIVER
I'm gonna sit on my butt.

Everyone piles out of the bus, the cheerleaders bouncing all

the way, and the grunge girls looking equally disgusted with

the proceeding. Max, running to class, slides down a banister
and bumps into Principal Mazur, knocking his toupee askew.

MAX
I've got less than an hour, and when
this is ended, I'll either be
famous...

MAZUR
Or you'll be suspended!

EXT. STADIUM

Max runs into the stadium and onto the track, flips over a
hurdle and continues past a group of heavy girls doing
exercises and looking exhausted.

ALL
Just think of all the time I've been
losing, waiting until I could say...

The graduates, in caps and gowns, toss their caps in the
air. Several kids jump out of cars, one of them slamming the
door on the puckered lips of their mother. The band and
cheerleaders are practicing formations in the field. The
drum major tosses her baton in the air and catches it in her
teeth.

ALL
Gonna be on my own, kiss the parents
good-bye, gonna party from now to
the end of July, things will be going
my way after today...

Max runs up to the top of the bleachers and enjoys feeling
the wind blowing in his face. The school bell rings,
attracting everyone's attention - the band and cheerleaders,
the jockstrap flinging kids, Chad and his girlfriend, who
were kissing, and Max.

MAX
I wish that this was the day...after
today.

Just after finishing the line, Max starts down the bleachers
and trips. He falls, flailing and screaming, to the bottom
of the bleachers and lands on his face. A group of students
including Chad and his girlfriend gather around him, laughing
as he reaches to pick up his books. The crowd disperses, and
Roxanne approaches to help him pick up his books. When Max
sees who she is, he stands up, flabbergasted.

ROXANNE
Are you all right?

MAX
Yeah...yeah, I'm okay, I just -

Max babbles incoherently and Roxanne gives him an
understanding smile. Then both start to giggle.

MAX
(babbling)
Uh...um...well, I...ah...
(chuckles)
.um...h-yuk!
(Goofy laugh)

Max, absolutely mortified with the silly laugh, covers his
mouth, gasping, and starts to back away. Roxanne gives him a
curious glance, and he turns and runs away. Part of the way
to the stadium exit, he runs into some garbage cans and trips.
Recovering, he runs out the exit, screaming - leaving Roxanne
standing by herself.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

Now inside the school, Max berates himself while walking
down the hall.

MAX
I can't believe I did that! Arrgh!
She finally says "hi" to me, and
what do I do? I joke! "H-yuk"...She
probably thinks I'm a big spazz.

Max approaches PJ, who is digging through his locker.

PJ
Where have you been, buddy?

MAX
Hi Peej...did you get the camera?

PJ, looking very nervous, pulls a camcorder out of his locker.

PJ
(nervously)
Look, Max...if my Dad catches me
with this, he'll kill me! Are you
sure you gotta do this?

MAX
Roxanne doesn't even notice me...but
after today...

A bright light suddenly envelops them. Squinting, they look
toward the source and see a cart full of audio/video
equipment. A 19505 style guitar riff plays. Bobby, standing
beside it, is drinking from a fountain through a straw.

MAX
Bobby!

Max and PJ approach the cart and join Bobby in the room.

MAX
Wow! This is all for us?

BOBBY
(finishing his drink)
Mmmmm...slurpage...

MAX
Oh, this is gonna be great, man!

Max starts to pull the cart out of the room, but Bobby stops
him.

lO.

BOBBY
Dude...need fundage, bro...
MAX
Oh, your fee...yeah, yeah...right

here.

Max hands Bobby a brown paper bag, which Bobby opens
anxiously.

BOBBY
Cheddar! Owww!
(howling like a wolf)
Cheddar whizzie!

Bobby shakes the can up and holding it in the air, squirts a
bunch of it into his mouth. Max and PJ react with nauseous
looks. Bobby stops spraying and starts licking it off of his
lips. He coughs and thumps his chest, coughing some of the
cheese onto Max and PJ.

BOBBY
Mmm...Spre'y scumshus. [It's pretty
scrumptious]

Bobby, suddenly appearing behind Max and PJ who are trying
to wipe the cheese off of their clothes, grabs them both
around the shoulders, forcing Max and PJ to smile.

BOBBY
Let's do it, ladies!

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

Stacey stands behind the podium in an auditorium packed with
rowdy students, giving them the standard end-of-school
retrospective speech.

STACEY
As student body president, I just
want to say, like "yay" to all of us
for a really neat year.

NERDY KID
(mocking chant)
Yo Stacey! Talk to me, talk to me,
talk to me, baby!

Stacey shoots the kid a disdainful look.

STACEY
And finally, I hope you can all attend
my totally amazing end-of-school
party next Saturday to watch the

ll.

STACEY
Powerline concert live on pay-per-
view.

Everyone cheers loudly.

STACEY
Thank you, thank you very much...and
now, without further adieu, Principal
Mazur.

The cheering continues as Principal Mazur, offstage, is fixing
his tie and putting on his biggest smile. He walks into the
spotlight, which follows him toward the podium. Immediately,
all the cheering ceases, leaving only the sound of crickets
chirping. He reaches the podium and begins his speech.

MAZUR

Thank you, Stacey...and G'morning,
boys and girls. You know, every year
on the last day of school, I have
several youngsters approach me and
say, "Principal Mazur, what can we
do to not waste our summer vacation?
We don't want to waste our free time
sleeping, or visiting friends"...

Everyone looks at each other and yawns. Chad leans forward
in his seat to talk to Roxanne.

CHAD
Say, uh, Roxanne...about Stacey's
party...

The camera zip-zooms to Max, who is backstage and dressed in
a Powerline costume. He is poking his head out from behind
the curtain, and he sees Chad talking to Roxanne. Closing
the curtain, he zips up his costume and turns toward Bobby
and PJ.

MAX
Are you...uh...how are you doin'
down there, Bobby?

Bobby, wearing a welder's helmet, is using an acetylene torch
to connect piles of cables and equipment. A video monitor
beside him is flashing a variety of images. He lifts the
helmet and shoots Max and PJ a half sarcastic, half joking
glance.

BOBBY
Don't give me that attitude,
guys...I'm doing it all for you.

12.

He puts the helmet back on and continues. The scene shifts
to PJ, who is walking while looking into the camcorder's
viewfinder.

PJ
(nervously)
This is nuts. I don't know why I let
you guys talk me into this. If my
dad finds out, he's gonna nuke my
entire existence...aahh!

PJ isn't watching where he is going, and he trips on some
cables that are lying on the stage. He falls, alluding to
things to come, and briefly appears behind Mazur before the
curtain settles back into position. Max grabs him and helps
him up.

MAX
I hope this works...

On stage, Mazur continues his speech. The spotlight suddenly
goes out, leaving him surprised and in the dark.

MAZUR
...How about "science slumber
parties"! -- huh?

Backstage, Max dons his Powerline visor and gives the others
a "thumbs up".

Bobby, at the control panel, gives a thumbs up. PJ, turning
on the camcorder, gives a nervous thumbs up. Bobby presses a
button and a fast pop-rock beat begins playing. The curtain
begins to rise, revealing a large video projection screen.
Mazur starts to speak, but Bobby presses a button backstage -
dropping him through a trapdoor.

MAZUR
What?...Hey!...I'm not gonna just -
aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

Max, in a Powerline pose, appears on the screen with an
animated atom behind him and scan lines zipping up and down
the screen. The audience gasps and looks pleasantly surprised;
Bobby laughs heartily. The video display changes colors and
images dynamically as "Stand Out" begins.

The action is still occurring on the video monitor as special
effects footage of Max, with PJ running the camera.

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)
Some people settle for the typical
things, living all their lives waiting
in the wings. It ain't a question of

13.

MAX
if, just a matter of time, before I
move to the front of the line. Once
you're watching every move that I
make, you're gonna believe that I
got what it takes to stand out, above
the crowd even if I gotta shout out
loud. 'Til mine is the only face
you'll see, gonna stand out till you
notice me.

The scene changes to reveal the audience's positive reactions,
including Roxanne's. The camera angle rotates around PJ and
through his legs, as he continues to film Max. Max gets caught
in the cables lying on the floor and trips. He falls,
screaming, and rips through the screen, rolling out onto the
stage and leaving the monitor displaying static. He stands

up and is motionless for a moment, as he looks at the crowd
in the auditorium. The image of the crowd is reflected off

of his visor as he looks nervously around the room. He looks
at PJ and Bobby, who are standing offstage; they laugh and
give him the "thumbs-up". Max looks back toward the crowd,

and the reflection on his visor pans from the image of Bobby
and PJ to Roxanne - who is shyly smiling at the unknown
performer. Reassured, Max heads straight for her.

Bobby, offstage, decides to provide some visual flair by
spraying a foggy mist onto the stage.

BOBBY
A little smok-age! Owww!
(howling like a wolf)

Max strides across the stage, moonwalking.

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)

POWERLINE
(spoken)
If I could make you stop and take a
look at me instead of just...

POWERLINE WITH CHORUS
Walkin' by.

He lip-synchs the following lines directly to Roxanne. Her
face reflects off Max's visor.

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)

l4.

POWERLINE
(spoken)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do,
if it was getting you to notice...

POWERLINE WITH CHORUS
I'm alive.

PJ crawls onstage, hidden by the smoke, and hooks Max onto a
cable.

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)
All I need is every chance, a second
thought, a second glance to prove I
got whatever it takes...
(spoken)
It's a piece of cake.

Bobby and PJ lift Max off the stage and he flies around the
auditorium during the following chorus, much to everyone's
excitement.

CHAD'S GIRLFRIEND
Who's that guy?!

He grabs a basketball from a tall kid and dunks it in the
basket as he flies by.

MAX
(lip-synching Powerline)
To stand out, above the crowd even
if I gotta shout out loud. 'Til mine
is the only face you'll see gonna
stand out...

Max flies toward Roxanne, who is waiting with an outstretched
hand. They almost touch, but the cable he's on stops short,
pulling him backwards into spin as the music slows down and
stops. He swings toward a disgruntled Principal Mazur, who
stops him and takes off his visor.

OFFSCREEN KID
It's the Goof boy!

ALL

(gaSPS)
Everyone looks in shock at Max, except
Roxanne who smiles appreciatively.

Bobby (with PJ in sort of a headlock), still offstage, realize
their fate.

BOBBY
We're bust-ed!

15.
INT. PHOTO CENTER IN DEPARTMENT STORE

The scene changes with a camera flash to a close up of Goofy
making a funny face and squeezing a rubber ducky. The angle

changes and we see a small, bald baby on the verge of tears.
She is being photographed by Goofy, who is attempting to get
her to smile.

GOOFY
Coochy-coochy-goo-goo! Come
on...smile! Smiley-wiley!...B-b-b-b-
b-b-b-b-b...Oh come on, Kimmie...give

me a big -

Goofy squeezes a rubber ducky, making the typical squeaky
noise in an attempt to get her to smile. As he squeezes it,
the squeaker pops out of the toy and into his mouth - getting
caught in his throat. Gasping, Goofy makes the squeaky noise
repeatedly. This amuses the little girl, and she begins laugh-
ing. Seeing his chance, Goofy steps behind the camera and
takes the picture of the little girl - with the red-eye glow
intact. As he continues, Pete enters the scene. Goofy makes
the squeaky sound, which annoys Pete. Goofy looks at him and
makes an inquisitive-sounding squeak.

PETE
Stop goofin' around!

Pete slaps Goofy on the back of the head, dislodging the
squeaker. Finished, Goofy picks up the little girl and returns
her to her mother - continually making baby noises to amuse
the child.

GOOFY
Okay Kimmie, back to mommy, now. B-b-
b-b-b-b...
(baby talk)
You're such a cute little girlie...you
come back and see me...

KIMMIE'S MOM
Oh, you have such a way with children.

Goofy blushes as the mother leaves.
PETE
(mocking)
"You have such a way with
children"...pah!

Pete approaches Goofy, who is attending to the next customer.

GOOFY
Okay now...who's next over he-

16.
Pete knocks Goofy out of the way.

PETE
Step aside, Goof. Let a pro show you
how it's done...

Pete bends down and talks to the little girl. She kicks him
in the shin, runs around him several times, up his back, and
jumps on his head.

PETE
Oh hello, precious...ow!...oof!...
(to the mother)
You lucky woman...

Pete follows the little girl, who is hiding behind the photo
stand, and ducks back and forth several times attempting to
catch her. Finally, he reaches over the stand and grabs her
roughly.

PETE
Come on here, honey...it's picture
time...she's so cute...

LITTLE GIRL
Peek-a-boo!...oof!

The girl continues to struggle as Goofy and Pete talk.

GOOFY
Gawrsh, Pete...you sure are good
with kids...

PETE

Oh yeah...they love me. Why, PJ...he's
been begging me to take him on
vacation this summer.

GOOFY
Really? Where are you going?

PETE
Camping! Nothing like the great
outdoors to strengthen the bond
between a father and a son.

Pete attaches Velcro pads to the table and the girl's diaper,
then Velcroes her to the table. She attempts, unsuccessfully,
to get up.

GOOFY
Oh, Max would never go for anything
like that.

Goofy placates the little girl with a stuffed animal.

l7.

PETE
I don't know, Goof. Somethin's wrong
when a kid won't spend time with his
parents. For all you know he's running
around with some gang, and stealin'
stuff, and causin' riots...

GOOFY
Oh, Max is a good kid...he'd never
get mixed up into something like
that.

INT. PRINCIPAL MAZUR'S OFFICE

With a loud crash reminiscent of a jail door slamming, the
scene shifts to an overhead view of Max and Bobby waiting in
the Principal's office. Miss Maples, the secretary, sits
across the room from them, typing and humming the Hungarian
death march. Max is looking terrified, and Bobby is slouching
across the chairs - facing the wall.

MAX
I'm a failure, a complete loser...my
one chance to impress Roxanne and I
blew it...

After a few moments, Bobby mumbles and turns to Max, holding
a small sculpture made of squeeze cheese.

BOBBY
Hmm....Max, look...it's the leaning
tower of cheese-a.

He squishes the entire creation into his mouth messily and
eats it. After a moment PJ emerges, looking shell-shocked.

PJ
Oh, man...My Dad is gonna smash me
like a bug!

BOBBY

(cheerfully/jokingly)
Hey, PJ! Deten-tion! Ha ha ha!

MAZUR (V.O.)
Robert Zimmerooski...

BOBBY
(concerned)
Umm...okay ...I'm coming...
(quietly)
Max...here...guard this with your
life, dude...

18.

Bobby hands Max the can of squeeze cheese and pushes a
cartload of audio/ video equipment into Mazur's office, while
his signature guitar music plays in the background.

BOBBY
(confidently)
Hey! Ma-za-ur! What's up, bro?

Bobby begins talking to Mazur, and shuts the door. Max puts
his head in his hands and sits motionlessly. Roxanne and
Stacey enter the room, with Stacey chattering at a fast pace.
They approach the desk to get some papers.

STACEY
...and then the air conditioning
went on the fritz, so I figured with
all those kids in the house the place
would be like a sauna; so I'm all
freaked out, but then I thought,
like, "use it", so my theme's gonna
be ‘Powerline goes rainforest'. Too
much?...Roxanne, are you listening?

Roxanne notices Max sitting on the chair, and she gazes at
him. Stacey notices that she's lost her attention and sees
why.

STACEY

(knowingly)
Ohhhh....tsk, tsk, tsk.

She pushes Roxanne toward Max.

ROXANNE
Stacey, no...I don't wanna -

STACEY
Talk to him!

Roxanne walks over toward Max, but with his head down, he
doesn't notice her.

She clears her throat several times, but to no avail.

ROXANNE
Ahem...Ahem!

She turns back to Stacey and gives her a ‘now what?‘ glance.
Stacey motions her to continue.

STACEY
Tap him!

Roxanne approaches Max and taps him on the shoulder.

l9.

Startled, Max quickly sits upright and knocks Roxanne's books
to the floor. Realizing what he's done, he begins apologizing
as she begins to gather them.

MAX
Gosh, I'm sorry...

ROXANNE
It's okay.

He bends down to help her and they simultaneously reach for
the same book and touch each others' hands accidentally. Max
pulls his away, embarrassed.

ROXANNE
Um...I liked your dance.
MAX
Yeah....yeah?! Uh, yeah, it's from

Powerline's new video.

Both stand up simultaneously.

ROXANNE
I know, he...he's totally a genius.
MAX
Yeah, he's doing a concert next week
in LA.
ROXANNE
Oh yeah! Stacey is showing it at her
party.
MAX
Yeah...
ROXANNE
Yeah...
MAX

Uh, Roxanne...I was, uh, sorta kinda
thinking that maybe I'd, um, ask you
to go with me, that is, to
the...party...of course, if you don't
want to, I'd completely understand!

ROXANNE
Well, I was sorta, kinda thinking
that...I'd love to!

Max and Roxanne both start to fluster.

MAX
Yeah?

ROXANNE
Yeah!

MAX
Good!

ROXANNE
Great!

MAX
Terrific!

ROXANNE
Wonderful!

MAX
All right...

ROXANNE
Okay...

Stacey approaches to extract Roxanne.

STACEY
Come on Roxanne, we don't want to
belabor the moment, now do we?

ROXANNE
Well, I'd better be going...

MAX
(confidently)
I'll, uh, call you later.

ROXANNE
Okay...bye.

Roxanne backs away slowly, shyly and backs into the wall
beside the office door. After leaving, she walks down the
hall with Stacey.

STACEY
See? That wasn't so bad....I told
you men were easy to deal with...

Back in the principal's office, Max waves shyly at Roxanne
as she leaves then jumps up in the air and begins yelling.

MAX
(gleefully)
Yes!! She said YES!!! Hoo hoo hoo!
Everybody mambo!

Max begins dancing around the room, out of sheer joy, with
mambo music playing in the background.

20.

21.

After several moments, he grabs Miss Maples and involves her
in his dance...while she is still sitting in her chair.
Shortly, Mazur and Bobby appear at the office door. Bobby
smiles and encourages Max.

BOBBY
Yeah! Dance with her...groove with
her...
MAZUR
(angrily)

Miss Maples!

Mazur orders Miss Maples to call Goofy, even while she is
still careening back and forth in Max's mambo.

MISS MAPLES
(cheerfully)
Yes sirrrrr!

MAZUR
(angrily)
Get that boy's father on the phone!

MISS MAPLES
(cheerfully)
Right away sirrrr!

INT. PRINCIPAL MAZUR'S INNER OFFICE

Mazur stands in his office, with his paddle collection behind
him, looking through the slits of light penetrating his
miniblinds at Max.

GOOFY
Hello?

MAZUR
Uh yes, Mr. Goof...This is Principal
Mazur. I'm calling in regard to your
son, Maximillian.

GOOFY

Max? Oh my gawrsh, is he hurt?
MAZUR

No, Mr. Goof...he's in TROUBLE!
GOOFY

Trouble? What kind of trouble?
MAZUR

(angrily)

Dressed like a gang member...

22.
Goofy gasps in shock and staggers backward.

GOOFY
Gang member??

MAZUR
...your son caused the entire student
body to break into a riotous frenzy!

GOOFY
Riot?? Oh, couldn't be my -

MAZUR
If I were you, Mr. Goof, I'd seriously
re-evaluate the way you're raising
your child, before he ends up IN THE
ELECTRIC CHAIR!

GOOFY
The electric chair!?

Mazur hangs up and Goofy drops his phone. He slumps into a
nearby chair.

GOOFY
What am I gonna do?

INT. PHOTO CENTER IN DEPARTMENT STORE

Goofy sits shellshocked in the chair for a moment. Suddenly,
a bright blue light illuminates him and pans across the room -
accompanied by an announcement on the PA system.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Blue light special on aisle
three...blue light special on aisle
three.

Goofy rises slowly, and walks toward the rotating blue beam
of light. It crosses his face repeatedly and scans across
the room. Goofy approaches the sale table. On the table is
an assortment of small children's toys that look like a boy
fishing. He bounces the toy's spring-loaded head. Suddenly
Goofy's face brightens as he gets an idea.

GOOFY
Lake Destiny...

Now excited, Goofy runs back toward the Photo Department and
tells Pete his plans.

PETE
Okay, kiddo...now, smile!

Goofy sticks his head in front of the camera Pete is using.

23.

GOOFY
Lake Destiny Idaho!

PETE
Lake who-de wha!?

GOOFY
You were right, Pete...nothing like
the great outdoors to strengthen the
bond between father and son. You
said so yourself...

PETE
Well, yeah...but....

GOOFY
I'm goin' fishing! I'm goin' fishing
with my boy!

Without waiting for Pete's response, Goofy runs off, carrying
the toy. Pete shakes his head in confusion and looks back
through the lens.

PETE
Yeah...okay, precious...give me a
big smi-

The little girl he was photographing is gone, only her diaper
remains. She runs down the aisle in pursuit of Goofy.

LITTLE GIRL
Ha haha ha! Fishie! Fishie! Fishie!

EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL

Everything is absolutely still in a wide shot of the school's
front doors. Suddenly, the school bell rings and the doors
explode open and crowds of students pile out at high speed.
Among them is Bobby and a number of recurring characters;

the focus is on Max as he walks away from the school. A number
of people approach him, including some who had ridiculed him
earlier.

KID 1
Cool concert, lad!

MAX
(incredulous)
What?
KID 2

You wailed, bud!

24.

Max, incredulous, continues to take it all in. Chad's
girlfriend approaches him, but Stacey quickly shoves her
away.

CHAD'S GIRLFRIEND
Hey, Max...wicked dance...

STACEY
Forget it, girl...he's Roxanne's.

Suddenly PJ runs up behind Max and jumps on his shoulders.
Max strains against the load as PJ compliments him on the
day's events.

PJ
Way to go, Max! I just heard about
you and Roxanne...

MAX
Oof! Peej!

Max dumps him on to the ground. PJ begins a chant for him.

PJ
(increasingly loud)
See...I told you our plan would
work...Max!...Max!...Max!...Max!...
Max!...

Bobby, hanging from a statue, continues the cheer.

BOBBY
Max-i-mum!...Max-i-mu-um!

CHEERLEADERS
Max!...Max!...Max!...

ALL
Max!...Max!...Max!...

At this point, music builds in volume and segues into the
middle of "Stand Out" as Max leaves the schoolyard.

POWERLINE
All I need is every chance, a second
thought, a second glance to prove I
got whatever it takes.

Max runs past a schoolbus, slapping hands with people on the
sidewalk and in the windows. He then dons his ballcap and
Powerline visor.

MAX
(lip-synching)

25.

MAX
(spoken)
It's a piece of cake...

POWERLINE
To stand out, yeah yeah...
(repeats and digresses)
...till mine is the only face you'll
see, gonna stand out so you'll notice
me...

Max moonwalks past the bus stop ladies seen in "After Today",
spins around the bus stop sign and jumps - slapping the leaves
in a nearby tree. En route home, he runs through a number of
yards. Max runs under kids on a swingset, then swings from
their tire. He flies over a sunbather and bounces off her
diving board, landing on a Slip ‘n' Slide and grabbing a
skateboard. He skateboards over over a fence, then through a
construction site, doing loops inside a large pipe. He exits
the pipe and lands on a truck labeled "Starving House Pets
Moving and Storage". He skates off the truck, under the sofa
being moved, and directly into the house's kitchen. He zips
by a baby, and grabs its fork. He dismounts the skateboard
and somersaults across the street to his house as the music
fades and finishes. He enters the gate to his yard, and passes
Goofy - who is packing the car for a trip.

EXT. GOOFY'S FRONT YARD

MAX
Going somewhere, Pop?

GOOFY
Sure are, pal-eroonie!

MAX
Cool! Well, have a good time, Dad.
If you're gonna be gone more than a
month, drop me a line.

GOOFY
But Max, this isn't just MY
vacation...it's a vacation with me
and my best buddy!

MAX
Oh, Donald Duck?

GOOFY
No, silly! With you!

The camera does a zip-zoom toward Max, centering on his
shocked face. He collapses, falling backwards. Fading from
black, we see an upward-looking view of Goofy coming into
focus. He slaps Max's face lightly to rouse him.

26.

GOOFY
Are you okay, Maxie?

MAX
Wha-what did you say?

GOOFY
That's right! A vacation, son! We'll
spend some real quality time together!

Goofy picks him up and hugs him.

MAX
I think I'm gonna be sick.

GOOFY
Hey, got a present for ya!

MAX
No!...Dad!...Stop!...What are you-

Goofy grabs Max. After a flurry of hands, flying clothes,

and protests from Max, Goofy steps back to reveal Max dressed
in an fishing hat, hip waders and an inflatable vest. After

a beat, Goofy's hand appears and pulls the string on the
vest. As the camera pulls back quickly, the vest inflates
rapidly - puffing up to full size - leaving Max looking like
a large balloon. Goofy looks at him, pleased with the gifts.

GOOFY
You look just like I did at your
age.

MAX
(exasperated)
Please don't say that, Dad.

GOOFY
Wait, I saved the best for last.

Goofy produces a dusty old rectangular box. He blows clouds
of dust off the surface.

GOOFY
It's been handed down from goof to
goof to goof, and now...it's yours,
son.

Goofy opens the box to reveal an old fishing rod inside.

MAX
A stick?

GOOFY
No, silly, a fishin' pole!

27.
Goofy twirls the line in the air.

MAX
Fishing? We're going FISHING!?

GOOFY
Yep, just like my Dad and me did...two
best buddies fishing on Lake
Destiny...away from it all...

Goofy walks toward the car.

MAX
I don't wanna be "away from it all",
Dad...I LIKE ..."it all".

GOOFY

Hey, look, Maxie...we're usin' the
same map me and my Dad used. We'll
take the same route, make the same
stops, see the same sights...

Enchanted, majestic-sounding music begins playing as Goofy
opens an old, dusty map and spreads it across the hood of

the car. Max, still puffed up, waddles over. The map has a
tangle of criss-crossing, looping, wild lines drawn on
it...eventually leading to Lake Destiny, Idaho. At the bottom
is a list of names ending with Walter Goofy and Benjamin
Goofy, which are both crossed out, and beneath them is
scrawled "All Goofs". Max is shocked.

MAX
Agh! But that trip would take WEEKS,
Dad!

GOOFY
Exactly! Gettin' there's half the
fun!

Max pushes the map aside.

MAX
Put the map away, Dad...it's not
gonna happen...

GOOFY
Careful, son! You'll wrinkle my
past...and our future...

(mysteriously)
What the map says, Max, we will
follow...
MAX
That's very..."mystical" and

everything, Dad...but, uh,

28.

MAX
seriously.... there's this party I
have to go to and, it's really
important -

GOOFY

Aww...there will be plenty of time
for parties when you're older,
|Maxie...why, when I was your age,
I'd never even been invited to a
party, and look at me now!

Goofy strikes a proud pose.

MAX
(sarcastically)
Great, Dad...

Goofy opens the car door in hopes of persuading Max to get
in.

GOOFY
Hop in, Maxie.

Max shuts the door.

NO.

Goofy is uncertain how to proceed. He thinks a moment, and
his face brightens with an idea. He then frowns sadly and
proceeds to try to make Max feel guilty.

GOOFY
Oh, all right, then...guess I'll
just have to go - all alone, that's
all...just sit in the boat - all
alone...and talk to myself - all

alone...
MAX
(unmoved)
I guess so...
GOOFY

Oh, come on! Hop in!

Goofy opens the car door again hoping to persuade him. Max
refuses repeatedly and shuts the door each time Goofy opens
it.

MAX
No, Dad...

29.

GOOFY

Just hop right in there!
MAX

No.
GOOFY

Come on, Maxie...go for it!

At this point, Goofy is out of ideas, completely frustrated.
He grabs Max, who is still immobile in the inflatable vest,
and shoves them into the car. He ties him down with the
seatbelt, accompanied by a barrage of protests from Max.

GOOFY
We're ready for takeoff!

Goofy shuts Max in as he struggles with the restraints, runs
around the car and gets in the driver's side. He gets ready
to start the car.

GOOFY
Set for adventure, Maxie?

MAX
(exasperated)
Why are you DOING this to me, Dad!?

GOOFY
(frightened)
'Cause I don't want you to end up in
the electric chair!

MAX
Electric chair? What are you-

GOOFY
I'm not givin' up on ya,
son...together we're gonna work this
out.

MAX
Work this out!? But Dad!

GOOFY
No buts about it, Maxie boy...your
old pop knows best.

MAX
But...

Max is speechless. As Goofy starts the car to leave, he
resigns himself to the situation. He looks gloomily at the
fishing pole.

30.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET

Goofy backs out of the driveway and runs over part of his
fence, crushing it.

GOOFY
G'bye house!...g'bye mailbox!...g'bye
pile of broken wood!

They head down the road, and are only several blocks from
their house when Max remembers his date with Roxanne.

MAX
Good-bye hopes, good-bye dreams,
good-bye Roxanne...Roxanne!
(agitated)
Dad, I've got to stop somewhere first,
I have to talk to someone...

GOOFY
Well...

Max grabs the wheel of the car, turning it to the right. The
car careens around the turn, leaning sideways. Bouncing off

of other vehicles and severing a fire hydrant, the car finally
pulls to the side of the road. Max gets out and heads up the
walkway in Roxanne's front yard.

EXT. ROXANNE'S PORCH

GOOFY
Now make it quick, Maxie boy...we've
got to put some road behind us.

Max mutters to himself, frustrated.

MAX
You get to cancel your first date in
less than an hour...must be some
kind of lame-o record.

Max arrives at the front door and rings the bell. After a
short pause, a large, hulking man appears in the door in an
undershirt and boxer shorts. He grunts. Frightened, Max takes
a step backwards.

MAX
(nervously)
H-hi!...Is Roxanne home? My name is
Max...

The large man grunts angrily at Max.

31.

MAX
Does Roxanne live here?...Does she
even live on this block?...

Max starts to leave when Roxanne appears in the door beside
the man.

ROXANNE
Wait! It's okay Daddy, Max is a
friend from school. Go on, go
on...good Daddy...
(embarrassed)
Hey, Max...

Roxanne looks embarrassed and ushers her father back into
the house.

MAX
(incoherent)
He-uh...huh...

ROXANNE
(nervously)
Do you, uh, want to have a seat?

Max and Roxanne walk to the other side of the porch to talk.
Once there, Max lifts Roxanne onto the banister by her hips.
Her father, watching through the mail slot, grunts angrily
at them. This startles Max, and he quickly puts his hands
behind his back and grins innocently. Roxanne chides her
father.

ROXANNE
(angrily)
Daddy!

Once he leaves, Max hops onto the banister beside Roxanne
and they continue their conversation.

ROXANNE
I promise he'll be better behaved
when you pick me up for the party.

MAX
Yeah, that's, uh, sorta why I came
by...

ROXANNE
I'm really looking forward to it,
Max.

MAX
(dejectedly)
Yeah...I...was...too...

32.

ROXANNE
Was?

MAX
You see, my Dad's on this stupid
"father-son" kick...

ROXANNE
(sadly)
Oh...don't worry about it Max, it's
just a dumb party...

MAX
No, it's not! Roxanne, I really
wanted to go with you!

ROXANNE
No, I...Max, I understand...

MAX
But my Dad surprised me...I don't
even want to go, but I have no choice.

ROXANNE
(disappointed)
I'm sure I can find someone else...

MAX
(shocked)
S-someone else?

ROXANNE
I'll...just...talk to you later...

Roxanne begins walking toward her front door, to go inside.
She is almost to the door, and Max panics. He doesn't want
Roxanne to go to the party with someone else, so he blurts
out a lie.

MAX
Um...uh...Roxanne...my Dad
is...uh...my Dad is taking me to the
Powerline concert in LA!...ugh...

ROXANNE
(incredulous)
Your Dad's taking you clear across
the country just to see a concert?

MAX
(realizing what he's
said)
Um...you see, uh...my Dad knew, uh -
KNOWS - knows Powerline! They used
to play together...I-in a band! Yeah!

33.
Goofy beeps the car horn and yells to Max.

GOOFY
Come on, son! Let's get this show on
the road!

MAX
(deliberately)
Just a minute...you
party...animal...you.

Goofy grins sheepishly.

ROXANNE
You're really serious...

MAX
Absolutely...so, uh...you aren't
still thinking of going with someone
else, are you?

ROXANNE
Well, I guess -

MAX
(interrupting)
Because I was hoping I could, uh,
wave to you onstage, when we join
Powerline for the final number.

ROXANNE
This is incredible!

MAX
Well, I wouldn't miss our date for
anything that wasn't incredible,
Roxanne.

Roxanne kisses Max on the cheek. He stumbles backward, then
starts to walk toward the car.

ROXANNE
Have a great time at the concert,
Max...

Max mumbles something, still dazed, and stumbles slowly toward
the car. He is almost there when Roxanne shouts from here
porch.

ROXANNE
I'll see you on TV!

The gravity of his situation hits him and he quickly sobers
up.

34.

MAX
(to himself)
I'm in deep sludge.

Max gets in the car and hangs his head out the window. Goofy
starts the car and drives away.

EXT. HIGHWAY

The heavy music of the previous scene segues to a cheerful,
bouncy tune and we see Goofy's car zipping along a highway
among other cars. Then the view changes to that of a camcorder
viewfinder jerkily panning around the interior of the car

and toward Max as Goofy begins his vacation video.

GOOFY
Day One! Well, here we are, out on
the open road; retracing the steps
of my boyhood...and heeeeere's
Maxie!...A-hyuk!...Say hi, Max!

Goofy pans the camera toward Max, who is looking sadly out
the window. When prompted, Max looks briefly at the camera,
then quickly turns away.

GOOFY
Well, how about a wave?

Max puts his hand over the lens, but Goofy remains undaunted.

MAX
(irritated)
Not now, Dad.

GOOFY
What a kidder!....Hmmm...

Goofy looks at Max thoughtfully and begins to get frustrated
when he comes up with an idea. He checks his pockets and
finds a hastily scrawled list of games that he had played
with his father as a child. Some of the items include story
telling, road bingo, twenty questions and simon says. He
begins to read the list, and excitedly asks Max to play when
he picks one.

GOOFY
Fun games I used to play with my
Dad...road bingo...twenty que- oh!...
Hey Maxie, uh, let's play a game?
You think of a name, and I'll try to
guess who it is! Uh, man or woman?

MAX
(unenthusiastically)
Man...

35.

GOOFY
Man? Hmmm...that's a toughie...Walt
Disney!

MAX
Right...

GOOFY

Ooh, I'm good at this...now, uh,
I'll think of one...hmmm...

Goofy's thought is interrupted but loud and raucous rock
guitar music.

Surprised, he looks at Max, who is busy playing "air guitar"
with his hands and listening to the music.

GOOFY
(shouting over the
music)
Oh! You want to sing a song, huh? Me
and my Dad used to sing this one all
the time!

Goofy grabs an eight-track cassette from his rack, puts it
in the car's tape deck, starts it playing , and sings (poorly)
along with it. Max looks at Goofy in disbelief.

RECORDED MUSIC AND GOOFY
(song: "High Hopes")
High hopes, he's got high hopes,
he's got high apple pie in the sky
hopes -

Max, having heard enough, turns back to the radio and
continues his air guitar playing - interrupting Goofy's song.
After several moments, Goofy turns the tape back on and
continues singing...angering Max.

RECORDED MUSIC AND GOOFY
oops there goes another rubber tree -

Max turns his music back on, followed by Goofy playing his.
Their conflict escalates, and they switch songs faster and
faster, both getting continually angrier.

RECORDED MUSIC AND GOOFY
...oops there goes ano-...oops there
goes-...oops...oops...

Finally, they both jam their buttons simultaneously and the
stereo mangles the tape, then blows up in a puff of smoke.

36.

MAX
(angrily)
Oh great, Dad...now we don't have
ANY music!

GOOFY
Oh, Maxie...it's not so bad! We'll
just have to entertain ourselves.

Max sighs and resumes looking out the window. Goofy begins

to get frustrated as they sit in silence, with cars passing
quietly. He looks around for something to do, then notices
the car keys rattling against his Disney logo keychain in an
interesting rhythm. He looks in the side-view mirror and

sees that the tailpipe has joined in - puffing and backfiring
in time. Some rattling pots and pans in their luggage
contribute, and Goofy begins whistling.

Max looks at him, bored, as they merge onto the highway -
passing a sign labeled "Open Road" - and Goofy begins the
"Open Road" song.

Trying to liven him up, Goofy playfully pokes at Max, musses
up his hair, and grabs him in a hug-like hold - but he doesn't
pay attention to where he's going, and the car swerves wildly.

GOOFY
Do you need a break from modern
livin'? Do you long to shed your
weary load? If your nerves are raw,
and your brain is fried, just grab a
friend and take a ride together upon
the open road.

Max pries Goofy's arms off his neck, and returns to his
original position, exasperated.

MAX
All in all, I'd rather have detention.
All in all, I'd rather eat a toad.

GOOFY
Yuck!

Goofy nearly hits a tractor-trailer, then zips across lanes
of traffic. He hits the guard rail, sending out a shower of
sparks and setting the car on two wheels. While partially
airborne, Max's side of the car passes over a motorcycle
with sidecar. They then get back on course as they pass rows
of smoking factories.

MAX
And the old man drives like such a
klutz, that I'm about to hurl my
guts directly upon the open road.

37.

GOOFY
There's nothin' can upset me, cause
now we're on our way. Our trusty map
will guide us straight and true.

Now passing oil rigs, Goofy begins reading the map and
steering with his feet. Max looks into the clouds and imagines
one is Roxanne. His vision is interrupted as Goofy begins
running over construction cones and head straight for a
construction scaffold. Max screams and covers his eyes as

they plow into the lower rungs of the scaffold and knock it
over. Goofy doesn't notice anything. He puts the map away

and continues driving.

MAX
Roxanne please don't forget me; I
will return someday, though I may be
in traction when I do.

GOOFY
Me and Max relaxing like the old
days.
MAX
This is worse than dragon breath and
acne.
GOOFY
In a buddy-buddy kind of mode.
MAX
I'm so mad I think I may explode.
GOOFY
When I see that highway, I could
cry.
MAX

Y'know, that's funny - so could I.

GOOFY AND MAX
Just being out on the open road.

As they pass a pickup truck, Goofy notices that it is carrying
a man playing a piano. Three country singers pop out of the
piano and sing.

COUNTRY SINGERS
Howdy boys, is this the way to
Nashville?

Goofy waves to the singers, but nearly hits a tow truck. The
driver blows the horn at him.

38.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER
Watch it Mack, or you'll be gettin'
towed.

A prison transport, carrying a prisoner in stripes and chains.
Goofy looks worried and imagines Max in the same outfit. He
quickly accelerates to pass the transport.

PRISONER
I'm in no hurry to arrive, cause
I'll be turning sixty-five the next
time I see the open road.

Goofy and Max approach a small convertible with a small driver
and his huge wife.

MAN
Just a week of rest and relaxation.

WIFE
Yeah!

MAN
And the odd romantic episode.

MAX
Very odd!

Off to the side of the road, we see Mickey Mouse and Donald
Duck with backpacks and luggage. Donald looks angry.

MICKEY MOUSE
And it's Californ-i-a or bust.

An old lady driving in a brightly painted sports car full of
cats begins driving wildly past Goofy and Max, swerving
through lanes of traffic.

OLD WOMAN
Look out you dirt bags, eat my
dust...from now on, I'm on the open
road.

GOOFY
It's me and little Maxie, my pipsqueak
pioneer.

A "woody" station wagon full of nuns passes.
NUNS

They're partners forever westward ho -
YEE HAW!

On the other side, a limousine passes with a glitter-gloved
hand poking out the moonroof.

39.

MAX
Could someone call a taxi and get me
out of here...to Beverly Hills 90210?

A variety of vehicles surround them. Some include a fire

truck covered with firemen, a convertible driven by a bride
while the groom parachutes in, a zoo transport wagon, a flower
truck, a balloon truck, a gangster car with a person tied up
in the trunk, a hearse with a singing corpse coming out of

the coffin in the back.

ALL
Everyday, another new adventure,
every mile, another new zip code...and
the cares we had...

CORPSE
Are gone for good.

MAX
And I'd go with them if I could.

The other cars are joined by a motorcycle, a tractor trailer
and others. Many of the riders are now dancing on the roofs
of their vehicles, including the corpse, the nuns, the
firemen, and several wingwalkers on a biplane that flies by.

ALL
I've got no strings on me, I'm feeling
fancy free, how wonderful to be...on
the open road.

Goofy's car, now alone, zips under a bridge and knocks off
some of its luggage as they disappear into the sunset. The
scene changes to the next day. They are still driving on a
rural interstate. Goofy is again reading the map while
driving, and he slowly edges into the oncoming lane. Max,
not paying attention, suddenly realizes what is happening
when he hears a horn blaring.

At first he is too petrified to speak or move, but at the
last minute he screams and grabs the wheel, swerving the car
into its own lane - and barely avoiding a collision with a
tractor-trailer.

GOOFY
...a break from modern livin'...doo
doo dum dum....grab a friend...

MAX
AAHH!!...Dad! You're gonna get us
KILLED!! (gasp) (pant)...Why don't

you just give me the map?

40.

GOOFY
Oh, no thanks, son...navigatin's a
big responsibility!

Max gives him a dirty look.

GOOFY
Besides, you wouldn't want to spoil
the big surprise! I'm taking you
someplace pretty special!

EXT. LESTER'S POSSUM PARK PARKING LOT

Twangy country music plays as Goofy pulls into the parking
lot of Lester's Possum Park, a run-down tourist trap. The
entrance is shaped like a huge possum head with an open mouth
and big teeth. A mother is dragging a terrified little girl
into it. Max is mortified at the sight of it.

GOOFY
Gawrsh, it's even better than I
remembered...

LITTLE GIRL
No, Mommy! I don't wanna go! Wahhhhhh!

MAX
Yeah, fun...tell you what, I'm just
gonna wait right here in the car.

GOOFY
A-hyuk! Ya party pooper! Come on!
This is gonna be fun!

Goofy grabs Max and drags him out of the car.
INT. LESTER'S POSSUM PARK THEATER

An old man in front of the worn stage curtain introduces the
show to the audience - who are sitting on a variety of broken
benches and other objects.

EMCEE
(in an old voice)
Well howdy-there, folks...Lester's
is proud to present the Possum Posse
Jamboree...here it is.

The audience applauds enthusiastically. Goofy dashes in with
Max moping behind him.

GOOFY
Just in time...

41.

The curtain opens to reveal a cheaply designed and painted
set and an extraordinarily unimpressive mechanical "Lester",
which performs the musical number.

LESTER
Howdy, folks! Who's your favorite
possum?

AUDIENCE

Lester! Lester! Lester!

Goofy runs back to Max, who was lagging behind, and grabs
him.

GOOFY
Got us a seat right up front!

The Lester character introduces the others, each of which
pops out of their own hole. The Mordicai character fizzles
and sparks before working correctly.

LESTER
Let me introduce you to the posse:
Here's Beauford, Beulah and Mordicai!

MORDICAI
Hey, Lester...ready for yodelin'?

LESTER
Sure am, Beauford!

Country music begins playing and the mechanical "posse" begins
bouncing up and down and "playing" their instruments.

LESTER
Now gather ‘round, my possum
pals...join the jamboree. Come hoot
‘n' howl ‘n' holler from the hearth...

MAX
This is pathetic!

LESTER
...And every chicken, pig and goat'll
help by yelpin' out a yodel here at
Lester's Possum Park.

ALL
(yodeling)

Max looks down the bench he's on and sees the little girl
that was dragged in earlier. She smiles a big, toothless
smile at him and he grins sheepishly back.

42.

GOOFY
Yodelay-hee...yodel-odel-ode-lay...

LESTER
Lester's Possum Park.

The yodeling continues, and the little girls laughs more and
gives Max still bigger toothless smiles. Max finds all this
very unnerving. He rolls his eyes at Goofy and resigns himself
to pouting.

LESTER
Don't you wanna be, a hangin' from a
tree, we're mighty glad to see you
and the parkin's always free - here
at Lester's po-po-po...

The machine gets stuck and the emcee whacks it with his fist,
making it finish the show. Max puts his head in his hands in
resignation.

EXT. OUTSIDE POSSUM THEATER

As soon as the show ends, the whole crowd explodes out of
the theater. Trailing them is Goofy, fumbling with his
camcorder. He gets it working and points it at the door,
ready to film Max. He turns around and sees the souvenir
stand. He decides to get something for him. Max approaches
slowly.

GOOFY
Hey! That's the ticket!...I'll be
right back, my little possum pal...

Goofy walks away, toward the stand. Max is left alone to
mope when a big costume-character approaches.

MAX
(sigh)
My life's a living-

LESTER
Hello, little buddy!...Who's your
favorite possum?

Max doesn't want to be bothered, and is not happy to see
him. He begins to walk away when the character becomes more
insistent.

MAX
(angrily)
Don't TOUCH me.

43.

LESTER
Awwww....why such a long
face?...you're so sad...boo-hoo...I
know! You need a big hug from Lester!

Max knows what he's going to do, and starts to warn him -
but it's too late.

Lester grabs him, picks him off the ground, and squeezes him
tightly. This infuriates Max.

MAX
Don't even think about -
(grunt)
...unh...ugh...

LESTER
See?...now you feel all good inside!

Max slaps the character in the face, and its head spins around
and faces the wrong way. Disoriented, he stumbles off into

the background, where a group of little kids tackles him to
the ground and drags him away in a swarm.

MAX
Beat it, doofus!

Max watches contentedly, smiling to himself, as the kids

drag Lester off. He turns around to see Goofy coming toward
him with a hat shaped like a road-killed possum. Max protests,
but Goofy puts the hat on him anyway. After this, Goofy spies
the photograph stand - which is offering guests pictures
posing beside live possums. The little girl seen earlier is
having hers taken, and crying loudly.

MAX

Oh no, no Dad, not that! Please!
GOOFY

Here you go, sport!...What say we

get our picture taken?

MAX

You have GOT to be kidding...
GOOFY

Oh, all right...but you're missing

out!

Goofy walks toward the stand to have his picture taken. Max
begins to turn away when he hears loud laughter. He looks
back in shock.

MAX
Ugh.

44.

MAX
(sigh)
...Huh?

Goofy is hanging upside-down with the possums to have his
picture taken, much to the amusement of the crowd. Much to
Max's chagrin, Goofy yells to him.

GOOFY
Hi-ya, son!

An obnoxious kid standing near Max points at and mocks Goofy.

OBNOXIOUS KID
Hey everyone, check out the dork!

The photographer prepares to take the picture while Goofy
continues to hang.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Say "sassafrass"!

GOOFY
Sass-ee-frass!

Goofy and the possums pose and smile. The photographer takes
the picture, but just after the flash fades, the branch they
were hanging on falls - catapult- ing one of the possums
through the air. Goofy lands on his head while the possum
smacks into Max's face. After looking directly at Max for a
moment, the possum decides to hide - in Max's shirt. Max
starts jumping around wildly, trying to get rid of the possum.
The band takes this as their cue to play dance music, and
begins to do so. Goofy also thinks Max is dancing, and rushes
to join him.

MAX
Aahh!...Unh!...Get out!...oof!...Get
it out!

GOOFY
That's the spirit, Maxie!

Max resolves the situation by pulling his pants down and
extricating the possum. Just as he pulls his pants up again,
Goofy grabs him by the arm and begins spinning and dancing
him around in a comical country-style dance. All Max sees is
a flurry of laughing faces.

MAX
Dad!...No!...Dad!...DAD!...This is
embarrassing!

45.

The music ends, and Goofy props Max up on his knee as a
finale. The crowd applauds loudly, still laughing. Max glares
furiously at all of them.

GOOFY
Ta-da! A-hyuk!

The obnoxious kid pops out of the crowd to make fun of them.

OBNOXIOUS KID
It's dork and dork junior! Ha ha ha!

The crowd continues to laugh loudly. Max walks away form
Goofy, looks angrily at the people, and throws the possum
hat down on the ground in disgust. He shoves his way out of
the crowd, knocking a laughing kid to the ground in the
process. He stomps out of the park and returns to their car.

EXT. OUTSIDE LESTER'S POSSUM PARK

Max attempts to open the car's door, but it is locked. He
hits the window in frustration. Rain begins to fall as he
walks out of the parking lot. Goofy emerges from the park
entrance and sees Max leaving. Standing along the roadside
and trying to hitchhike a ride, a car passes and soaks Max
when it hits a puddle. He shakes the water off angrily. Goofy
runs toward him.

MAX
Aargh!

GOOFY
Max! Hey, what the heck're you tryin'
to do?

Goofy puts his hand on Max's shoulder, but Max jerks away.

MAX
(angrily)
Trying to get away from you!

GOOFY
(surprised)
Me? W-what did I do?

MAX
Forget it.

Max walks back toward the car, and Goofy follows him.
GOOFY

I thought we was havin' fun!...What's
the matter?

46.

MAX
(angrily)
Nothing. Let's just go!...Come on!

Goofy walks up and unlocks the car door for Max, then heads
around to the driver's side. Max gets in and shuts the door;

Goofy joins him after a moment. Sadly, he hands Max the possum
hat.

GOOFY
Oh, you dropped your hat...

The sight of the hat pushes Max over the edge. He screams;
and in a fit of rage, he tears at the hat, and throws it
against the window and windshield.

MAX

(furiously)
Aahh! This is the STUPIDEST
vacation!...You DRAG me from home,
you jam me in this DUMB car, then
drive a MILLION miles away, to see
some stupid RAT show!...Call me when
the trip's over.

Max rolls down the window and throws out the possum hat that
Goofy had bought him. Goofy hangs his head, crushed. He starts
the car and backs out accidentally running over the hat. He
looks back briefly, then pulls out into the stormy night. As
they drive away, the camera pans down to show a close up of
the battered hat, accompanied by mournful music.

EXT. PINE FOREST

The scene opens with an overhead view of Goofy pitching a
tent in a makeshift campsite. The camera pans left to show
Max sitting on a rock at the edge of a creek, absent-mindedly
stirring the water with a stick and watching some fish. He
swirls the water and, in his imagination, Roxanne's face
appears in the ripples. He smiles halfheartedly. Suddenly,
Goofy approaches in the water and his feet destroy the
illusion. Max looks up at him.

GOOFY
(carefully)
Hey, Max...you wanna get in some
fishin' practice? Just a couple a
days ‘til we get to Lake Destiny...

Max gets up and begins to walk away - leaving a line in the
dirt as he drags his stick.

MAX
Maybe later...

47.

Goofy turns away, depressed, and leaves the creekside. Max
throws his stick into the water.

EXT. GOOFY'S CAMPSITE

Goofy is putting some materials in the tent, and his head is
inside when the ground begins to rumble and shake. Suddenly,
the dark shadow of a large machine passes over him. The
vehicle straddles Goofy and the tent. Several large, clamping
feet jam into the ground viciously around the tent. A large
spinning blade on a long arm fells rows of trees. A satellite
dish pops out of the machine's roof, scanning the sky. A
large platform flips down from its side, revealing a patio
table and chair set. A spa and miniature basketball court

pop out. A swimming pool, complete with water, and a bowling
lane with balls also emerge before the noise ceases. A wide
shot reveals that the contraption is a huge RV. Max comes

out of the woods to see what is going on and is awed by the
sight.

MAX
Whoa! Now THAT's camping!

Goofy pulls his head out of the tent - still not noticing
the RV that is now situated over him.

GOOFY
Did you say something, Max?

Just as he finishes his phrase, the big metal door wings
down and lands on his head with a resounding clang. A thick
mist billows out, surrounding a shadowy but familiar figure.

GOOFY
Ow!...Pete?

PETE
(surprised)
Goofy? Oh, well what a serendipity-
doo-dah!...Who'd a thunk it, huh?

Max brightens up with the prospect of seeing his best friend.

MAX
Is PJ here?

PETE
Oh yeah, I'm sure he's loafin' around
here somewhere...

INT. PETE'S RV
"Stand Out" is playing loudly inside the RV while PJ is

cleaning. He is singing and dancing around the room as he
buffs the floor and dusts.

48.

Max pokes his head in the RV door, and after a bit of surprise
initially, he smiles at PJ's silly routine.

MAX
(to himself)
What a goob.

Max enters the RV and approaches the mammoth stereo, straining
against the volume of the sound. He shuts the music off, but
PJ doesn't notice...and continues his song for a bit before

he notices Max.

PJ
(singing)
...even if you gotta shout out loud,
no matter what the look it's Max
- Max!

MAX
He-he-hey!

PJ and Max perform a long and involved handshake while saying
hello.

PJ
Wow! Small wilderness, dude!...Didn't
expect to run into you!

MAX
(joking)
Apparently not!

PJ
(joking)
You're just jealous, man...cause you
ain't got the moves!

Max turns around and admires the entertainment center and
fish tank. He scares the octopus inside the tank, and it
swims away in a cloud of ink.

MAX
Yeah, you can keep "the moves"...but
I wouldn't mind having this
RV!...Whoa!

PJ

Aw, come on. You're the star!

MAX
(surprised)
W-what?
PJ

Going to the Powerline concert?

49.

PJ
Oh, it's unbelievable, man.

MAX
Who told you about that?

PJ punches Max lightly on the arm.

PJ
Hey, come on, everybody in town knows
about it, Max...you are gonna be
famous, buddy...
(joking)
Especially with Roxaaaanne...

Max walks away dejectedly, and leans on the door frame of
the RV.

MAX
There's, uh, only one person who
doesn't know about it yet, Peej...
PJ
Who?
My Dad.
EXT. BOWLING LANE ON ROOF OF RV

Goofy watches as Pete bowls on his rooftop lane as they talk.

PETE
So tell me, Goof...
(sigh)
...is that kid of yours still givin'
you guff?
GOOFY

Oh, I don't know what's wrong...Just
seems like everything I try only
drives Max further away...maybe I
oughta just back off...I don't know.

PETE
Wrong, Goof...look - if you keep ‘em
under your thumb, they'll never end
up in the gutter!

Pete rolls his ball down the lane as he finishes the phrase.
The ball strikes the pins and knocks them all down - except
one. Pete looks surprised.

GOOFY
Too bad, Pete...almost...

50.

Pete looks angrily at Goofy, and decides to prove his point.
He bellows at PJ.

PETE
Almost? Ha! Watch this....PJ!!!

PJ rushes to Pete, and stands at attention - as if in the
military.

PJ
(frantically)
Yes, sir! Coming, sir! Yes sir!

Pete points down the lane at the remaining pin. PJ knows
what he's supposed to do. He runs down and kicks the pin
over. He looks back at Pete, pleased with himself. Pete

immediately begins to celebrate his "victory" by dancing
around and chanting.

PETE
Woo-hoo! Strike-o-la! Hee-hee ha-ha!
Thank you, thank you! Yes! And the
crowd goes wild!

Goofy and Max stand speechless in amazement at the spectacle.
As PJ rushes back toward Pete, Pete fakes a high-five with
him and laughs cruelly. PJ looks dejected.

PETE
High-five, son!...Psyche! Ha ha ha!
Say, Goof...why don't you two stay
for dinner?

PJ's face brightens and Max smiles.

MAX
Cool!

GOOFY
Oh, no thanks, Pete...uh, Max and I
have some fish to catch!

Goofy puts his hand on Max's shoulder and musses his hair as
he says this. Max gets angry and flings Goofy's hands aside.

MAX
(angrily)
Aw, Dad! We can do it tomorrow...so,
uh, what are we havin'?

GOOFY
(surprised)
But Max! I thought-

Pete elbows Goofy and quietly gives him "advice".

51.

PETE
(quietly)
Ahem! Under your thumb, Goof...

Goofy thinks for a moment and his face hardens. He sets his
jaw and confronts Max.

GOOFY
(sternly)
Maximillian!

MAX
(surprised and annoyed)
What?

GOOFY
(sternly)
Get your gear, little man! We're
going fishin'!

Max frowns and sets his jaw, challenging Goofy. Goofy responds
with authority.

GOOFY
(loudly)
And I mean NOW!
Max turns away and leaves, defeated.
MAX
(to himself)
Argh!

Goofy looks triumphantly at Pete, and they wink and exchange
thumbs-ups.

Goofy strides off.
EXT. WOODLAND LAKE

The water of a quiet stream is disturbed when Goofy pushes
an unwilling Max out into the stream - both of them in waders.

MAX
Dad, I don't even know how to fish!

GOOFY
Oh, come on! That never stopped
me!...Let me show you a little family

secret - handed down through about
twelve or thirteen Goof generations
...The Perfect Cast.

52.

MAX
(sarcastically)
The Perfect what?

GOOFY
The Perfect Cast! My Dad taught it
to me when I was about your
age...okay, now...watch carefully!

Max watches, unimpressed, as Goofy shakes his body around to
loosen up and demonstrates the cast.

GOOFY
You gotta be loooooose,
relaaaaxed...you put your feet apart,
then...ten o'clock, two o'clock,
quarter to three, touchate, twist,
over, pot-o-dew, I'm a little tea
pot, and the wind up!...

Goofy swings the pole backward to wind up for the cast, and
he inadvertently hooks a steak on Pete's nearby barbecue
grill. He makes the cast and snatches it away. Pete, who was
looking the other way, looks back to his steak and is
surprised to find it gone.

GOOFY
...AND LET ‘ER FLY!

Goofy swings the pole, and sends the steak flying. He looks
proudly at Max, who is still frowning imperiously.

GOOFY
The Perfect Cast...

The steak overshoots the water and lands on the opposite
side. After a moment, a shadow covers it, followed by an
approaching pair of large feet.

The camera pans upward to show Bigfoot eating a tree branch.
He smells the steak, looks down and spies it. Goofy doesn't
realize what is going on, and he continues his demonstration.

GOOFY
...and now, we reel ‘er in!

Bigfoot looks at the branch, the steak and back again. He
decides the steak looks better, and throws the stick away.

He prepares to eat the steak when a tug from the line sends

it hopping a bit. After recoiling in fear, he gets angry and
attempts to catch the treat - which is now speeding away as
Goofy reels in his line. Bigfoot, roaring, makes several
unsuccessful attempts to catch the steak and is eventually
dragged underwater. Goofy is still fighting the line, thinking
he's caught a fish.

53.

GOOFY
Whoa! Quick, get the camera!

Max retrieves the camera and hands it to Goofy, who begins
filming - thinking he's going to film a large fish he's
caught.

GOOFY
Must be over three pounds! I don't
want to miss this!

Goofy pans the camcorder upwards and sees Bigfoot through
the viewfinder, who is holding a fish in his mouth. Goofy
looks at him in amazement. Max, however, realizes the trouble
they're in.

GOOFY
(incredulously)
Look, Max!

MAX
(screaming)
Uh...da-da-Dad!? IT'S BIGFOOOOOT!

GOOFY
Could you back up a bit Mr. Foot?
You're out of focus.

Bigfoot roars angrily, and Goofy and Max flee, and Goofy

swings the pole in the process. The steak on the end of the
line is yanked out of Bigfoot's mouth and flies through the
air. It hits Pete in the face, and he pulls it off angrily.

PETE
What's the idea - BIGFOOT!

He looks in their direction and sees Bigfoot chasing them
toward him. Pete grabs the grill and runs back toward the RV
in fear. He tosses the grill inside and slams the door behind
him. All the RVs attachments and appendages are jerked inside
quickly and it zooms away, leaving behind Goofy and Max's
tent, and a few puddles of water from the pool. Goofy is
still taping Bigfoot, watching him through the viewfinder as
he runs. Tripping over the tent, he drops the camera. It
continues to film them as they attempt to get into the car.

GOOFY
Behold, the legendary Bigfoot...fabled
but seldom - aaahhhhhhhh!
Ow...ow!...oof!...ow!

MAX
Dad! Quick! He's coming!

54.

The car is locked, so they both get into the car through the
sunroof. Goofy frantically tries to close it behind them,

and succeeds just before Bigfoot reaches them. Frustrated,
Bigfoot jumps onto the car's roof and rocks it back and forth
a few times. He sees their camping equipment and decides to
investigate, leaving them alone. Max and Goofy watch from
the car, laying low.

MAX
I can't believe it! Bigfoot!

GOOFY
And I got the only video!

MAX
We're gonna be famous!

As Max finishes his statement, Bigfoot finds the camera and
gleefully pulls the videocassette apart.

MAX
(disgusted)
Let's just get outta here.

Goofy checks his pockets for the car keys. Coming up empty
handed, they look at Bigfoot - who is holding the keys,
smiling. He tosses them away into the forest. Goofy gets
discouraged and Max gets angrier still. Bigfoot continues to
dig through their baggage, wearing a pair of Max's underwear
on his head. Some time later, Max and Goofy are still in
the car - waiting.

MAX
Is he gone yet?

Suddenly, two sock-wearing hands appear in front of the
windshield. Bigfoot performs a primitive puppet show, then
laughs riotously at the performance.

BIGFOOT
Me-me-me-me...grrrrr...grumble...me-
me-me...ha ha ha ha!

Goofy responds to Max's question.

GOOFY
Nope...still here...

Bigfoot runs back to the baggage, sending a shower of clothes
and other items across the car's hood while Goofy and Max
talk. A grumbling noise is heard.

GOOFY
Gee, Max...is that Bigfoot or your
stomach?

55.

MAX
Man, I'm starving!

A can of soup lands on their hood and lands on end right in
front of them.

GOOFY
A-hyuk! Alphabet soup, comin' up!

Goofy rolls down the window to reach the soup. In the process
he makes a small noise, which Bigfoot hears. Looking up,
alarmed, Bigfoot is crushing a can of whipped cream in his
mouth. When he sees that Goofy and Max are vulnerable, he
begins running toward them, roaring. Terrified, they try to
get their can of soup inside even faster.

MAX
Dad!...DAD!...stop playing around,
he's coming!

Just before he reaches them, Goofy manages to roll the window
up, and Bigfoot bounces off the car - landing on his back.

As he sits up, a headphone radio that had been sent flying
lands on his head. Disco music begins playing, and Bigfoot
reacts with fear. After a few moments, he begins to enjoy

the music, laughing and moving with the beat.

INT. GOOFY'S CAR

The cigarette lighter in Goofy's apartment pops, and he
removes it. He balances the can of soup on top of the lighter.

GOOFY
Well...it's nice to know this thing's
good for somethin'!

Waiting for the soup to finish, Goofy and Max sit, looking
away from one another without speaking. Suddenly, Bigfoot
appears in the window behind them in the distance. He dances
to "Stayin' Alive" behind their heads, but they don't notice
him. After he's gone, silence returns. Max and Goofy look at
one another simultaneously, the they both look away,
embarrassed. More uncomfor- table silent moments pass when
Goofy begins chuckling without warning.

GOOFY
Hmm-hmm-hmm...ha-ha-ha-ha! MAX What's
so funny?

Goofy points to the can of soup warming on the dashboard.

GOOFY
Hi Dad Soup!

56.

MAX
(curious)
Huh?

GOOFY
Oh, don't tell me you don't remember
Hi Dad Soup?

Max looks at him with a blank look.

GOOFY
Oh, come on! Sure you do! You used
to spell things out using the letters,
like uh, "Hi Dad" or "Maxie" or -

MAX
(jokingly)
"Ambidextrous"?

GOOFY
Yeah, that's - huh? Naw...little
words like, uh...

MAX
"Hasta la vista"?

GOOFY
Like "Bye-bye!"

MAX
...or "I pledge allegiance"...

GOOFY
...or "I love you-"

Goofy stops himself short and looks surprised at what he's
said. A soft, sad oboe piece begins. Max looks equally sad,
and they both turn away from one another. Max, trying to
fill the silence inquires about their meal.

MAX
Uhhh...is it *s-soup* yet?

GOOFY
Oh, almost forgot...

Goofy picks up the can and opens it by puncturing the lid
with his big front teeth.

MAX
Whoa! Where'd you learn to do that?

Max picks up a Styrofoam cup and Goofy fills it with soup.

57.

GOOFY
Your granddad taught me that, when
we went to Yosemite...

MAX
You two did a lot together, huh?

GOOFY
(sadly)
Yup...

Max looks sadly into his soup. Both of them begin at speak
at once, but neither hears the other and they both out
themselves off.

MAX/GOOFY
(simultaneously)
Dad.../Max...
GOOFY
Umm...uhh....how's the soup?

Max drinks some of the soup and answers him. He wipes his
mouth, but some of the soup remains on his face.

MAX
Not bad...I mean, uh...(ahem)

Goofy sees the soup and smiles.

MAX
What?
GOOFY
(shaking his head)
Nothin'.

The silence is interrupted by grunts from Bigfoot as the car
lurches back and forth. Bigfoot climbs onto the roof and
lays down to sleep.

GOOFY
Well, we might as well get some
shuteye...I don't think we're goin'
anywhere tonight...

Goofy lays down on the seat and curls up to sleep. Max wipes
the soup off his mouth and looks down into the cup
inquisitively, swirling the soup around.

After a few moments, Goofy is roused by a tap to his shoulder,
and Max hands him the cup of soup. Goofy looks down into the
cup, in which the letters now spell "Hi Dad". Deeply moved,

he looks back at Max, who is lying down, nearly asleep.

58.

GOOFY
(whispering)
Hi Maxie...

After a brief establishing shot of the exterior of the car
with Bigfoot on top to indicate the passage of time, Goofy

is seen sitting upright in the front seat of the car - snoring
loudly. Bigfoot is also snoring loudly on the roof. Max,
however is staring into space with bloodshot eyes, unable to
sleep. He sits up in the seat and fumbles through the bag
beside him. Pulling out a postcard from Lester's Possum Park,
he finds a pencil and decides to write to Roxanne.

MAX
(voice over of writing)
Dear Roxanne...couldn't sleep -

His thought is interrupted by a particularly loud snore by
Goofy and Bigfoot together.

MAX
(voice over of writing)
So I thought I'd drop you a line.
Dad and I are having a great time!
We're only days away from LA, and I
can hardly wait for the...big...
concert...ugh...

He begins to rethink his letter, when Goofy yawns and talks
in his sleep.

GOOFY
Hi dad
(yawn)
Soup, please...

Max smiles, touched...and decides to do the right thing.

MAX
(voice over of writing)
(sigh)
Dear Roxanne, sorry I lied...I'm not
really going to the Powerline concert.
You may never want to see me again...

Realizing what he's saying, Max stops.

MAX
Oh, man! I'm dead no matter what I
do!

Frustrated, he sits back in the seat and kicks the dashboard.
The glove compartment pops open and Goofy's map springs out
into Max's lap.

59.

He looks at Goofy to be sure he's still asleep, then begins
tracing the path on the map with his finger. He notices that
their course meets a junction that leads to Los Angeles. A
pencil rolls out onto the map, stopping in front of him. Max
picks up the pencil and debates what to do. He nervously
begins erasing the part of the line that leads to Lake
Destiny, Idaho...watching Goofy to see if he's waking up. He
begins drawing a new course on the map when the pencil breaks.
The soft sound seems deafening to Max in the silence. Goofy
begins to stir. Frantic, Max grabs the broken point and
continues to draw. Goofy begins to wake up as Max quickly
completes the line and returns the map to the glove
compartment. He sits back in his seat innocently as Goofy
rouses and looks at Max sleepily.

GOOFY
(sleepily)
How many cups of sugar does it take
to get to the moon?

MAX
(nervously)
Uhh...three and a half?

Having not actually been awake, Goofy flops back into the
seat and begins snoring again. Max sinks into his seat,
relieved. He looks at the postcard he had written and tears
it up. Holding the pieces out the window, he lets the wind
carry them away. From a distance, we see the pieces flying;
one lands in a tree near the camera - it clearly reads "I
lied".

EXT. TRUCK STOP
A landscape covered with tractor trailer rigs is distinguished

only by a set of small buildings with large signs reading
"Diner", and "Eat and Get Gas".

Soft country music plays to set the atmosphere.

INT. TRUCK STOP

In the truck stop, the first view is a reflection of the
diner's interior on a bell. In the reflection some of the
patrons, including Elvis, can be seen.

The image is disturbed when the cook rings the bell.

COOK
Pick up!

WAITRESS
Hold your horses!

60.

The view pans back as the waitress collects the meals and
heads out through the crowded diner full of chattering people.
She arrives at Goofy and Max's table with their food.

WAITRESS
Short stack?

GOOFY
Right here!

WAITRESS

Here you go, hon...

She turns to Max to hand him his food, but he is preoccupied
and doesn't hear her.

WAITRESS
Eggs...eggs...EGGS...

MAX
Oh! Oh yeah, yeah, right
here...sorry...

WAITRESS
Here you go, cutie...

The waitress sits his food in front of him and he looks down
at it. The eggs and bacon are forming a smiley face. Goofy
begins eating his pancakes when he notices Max absently
picking at his food. He thinks for a moment then looks at
the map - and decides what to do.

GOOFY
Max, I think we need to talk about
this...

Max, thinking he's been caught in the act, stutters nervously.

MAX
Huh?

GOOFY
Seems to me you need to start takin'
some responsibility around here...

Goofy stands up at his seat, taps his water glass and draws
everyone's attention. Max shrinks into his seat, embarrassed.

GOOFY
Excuse me, uh, can I have your
attention, please? I, Goofy, hereby
dub my son, Maximillian, official
navigator and head which-way-er of
this here road trip.

61.

Goofy hands Max the map, ceremoniously. The other people in
the diner applaud and cheer loudly.

MAX
(incredulous)
Seriously?
GOOFY

I'm not even lookin' at the map
anymore. As a matter of fact, you
can pick all the stops from here to
Lake Destiny. I trust you
wholeheartedly, son.

Max looks back at Goofy sheepishly. Goofy raises his mug of
coffee for a toast, and Max joins him with his water
glass...gingerly.

GOOFY
To the open road!

MAX
To the...open...road...

A piano slide leads into a jazz/pop tune that provides the
background music for a music montage. They clink their cups
together, then the car is seen leaving the diner.

MUSIC MONTAGE (descriptions of segments)

An overhead view of the creased map shows Goofy's car driving
around on it surrealistically, with clouds overhead casting
shadows on the map as they head toward their destination.

Goofy attempts to ride a jet ski, plunging into the water
and shooting out again. He loses control and runs it aground.
Proceeding up the beach, he slides past people sunbathing
and through a row of cabanas. He emerges on the other side
dressed in a variety of women's clothing.

A close up of the car's front wheel follows, and the wheel
blows out. Max and Goofy attempt to change the tire in a
series of segments that are intersper- sed through the
montage. Here, they both reach for the spare tire simult-
aneously, and hit their heads together. Recoiling, Max rubs
his head, and Goofy gets the tire.

Max and Goofy ride a roller coaster side by side. Max enjoys
himself immensely, but Goofy gets sick. Emerging from the
restroom (labeled with a symbol that looks like him), holding
his stomach gingerly, Goofy is greeted by Max, who cheerfully
offers him a tray of junk foods - hot dogs, french fries,
nachos and soft drinks. Upon seeing the food, Goofy grabs

his mouth and races back into the restroom to throw up again.

62.

A monster truck crushes the roofs of a row of small cars
while Max and Goofy look on at a monster truck rally. Max,
swinging a giant foam "number one" finger, notices that Goofy
is holding his head in an attempt to block out the noise.

Another "driving across the USA" map sequence shows them
getting closer to their destination.

Max uncovers Goofy's eyes, in order to surprise him with
their current stop. Goofy opens his eyes to see the World's
Largest House of Yarn. Excited, he yells "Oh Boy!", grabs
Max by the arm, and drags him along to see the house.

Max and Goofy are watching a mime on a street corner. The
mime is performing the standard "pulling on a rope" routine,
appearing to pull on an overhead rope. Goofy nudges Max and
winks at him. He approaches the mime, pretending he's
following an imaginary wall. He makes a scissors motion with
his fingers, and the mime gestures as if he's holding his
rope out to be cut. Goofy smiles and makes a cutting motion
where the rope would be and the mime smiles back for a moment
before a piano falls and lands on him. Goofy and Max turn
around and begin whistling innocently as they slip away.

Another map sequence establishes them as being closer still
to Lake Destiny.

Returning to the tire changing sequence, Goofy is in the
background pumping air into the new tire while Max struggles,
trying to remove the blown tire.

He slips, and the tire wrench flies through the air like a
boomerang. Goofy ducks, and it just misses his head.
Returning, the wrench hits the jack supporting the car. The
car falls, propelling the old tire off at high speed.

It hits Goofy in the chest just as he's lifting the new tire.
He sends the new tire flying, and it lands on the car's axle -
just as the car is on it's way down from a bounce. Max and
Goofy exchange pleased glances.

Goofy is holding a camera at arm's length, in an attempt to
take a picture of himself and Max standing in a cave. He is
oblivious to the many eyes behind him, watching. He takes

the picture, and the flash disturbs the bats. They fly toward
them. Goofy and Max run out the opening to the cave; the

sign above it reads "Carl's Butt Caverns."

A batter at a baseball game the Goofy and Max are attending
hits the ball. It heads for them, and Max readies himself
and his glove in hopes of catching it. He stands up to catch
the ball, but fumbles it. Goofy makes a dive to catch it and
he ends up going over the edge of the balcony.

63.

He falls, but manages to catch himself on a string of
streamers. As the streamers stretch, he falls right through
the dugout roof, where he is suspended momentarily. He hands
the ball to the player sitting there on the bench, and he
signs it. The streamers spring back, flinging Goofy back to
his seat - Max catches him and they exchange pleased glances.

A close up of the car's wheel shows the new tire is almost
completely in place. Max and Goofy are alternately turning
the wrench. When they finish, they slap hands in a high five.

The music comes to a close when the car is seen driving off
into the sunset, but instead it turns into the parking lot
of the Neptune Inn.

INT. GOOFY AND MAX'S HOTEL ROOM

After a brief establishing shot of Goofy and Max carrying
their luggage through the door, they emerge in their room.
It is lit in an eerie green light that befits the nautical
theme. The waterbeds are transparent with fish swimming
inside, and the rest of the decor is similar.

GOOFY
Gawrsh!

Max sees the waterbed and jumps on it. The water sloshes him
back and forth. Goofy looks at and feels the material the
furniture is made of.

MAX
Who-ho-hoa! Check out the bed!

GOOFY
Check out the dresser...coral!

On the wall there is a night light shaped like Ariel, which
both Goofy and Max admire.

MAX
Nice lamp!

GOOFY
Classy choice, there, navigator.

The quiet is broken by a loud pounding at the door followed
by yelling. Goofy and Max begin to approach the door gingerly.

PETE
This is the Police! We've got the
place surrounded, see? You Goof's
come out with your hands up!

Pete breaks the door open and pretends to fire a machine gun
at them, he knocks Goofy and Max backwards onto the floor.

64.

PETE
B-b-b-b-b-bang! Ha ha ha! You
should've seen the look on your face!

Goofy looks at Max, and tries to pretend that he wasn't
frightened, but Max doesn't believe it.

GOOFY
Ah-hyuk! You really had him fooled,
Pete.

MAX

Me!? You jumped out of your skin!

Goofy and Max begin shoving and punching each other playfully.

GOOFY
Nuh-uh! I's just pretending for your
sake!
MAX
Oh, right, sure...
GOOFY
Did too!
MAX
Did not!

Goofy grabs Max and begins mussing up his hair, both laugh.

PETE
Oh ho, ain't this sweet...

Pete tries to "wise Goofy up" by making him distrust Max. He
grabs Goofy by the arm and quietly gives him "advice".

PETE
(quietly)
Don't let him fool you with that
buddy-buddy act, now..."under your

thumb"...
He releases Goofy, who is looking more and more concerned.

PETE
So! Since we're all bein' palsy-
walsy here, how about lettin' me
hook up the RV?

Pete grabs Goofy around the shoulders again.
GOOFY

(reluctantly)
Well...

65.

PETE
Oh, it's just a tiny little extension
cord, you'll hardly even notice it.

Goofy relents, so Pete calls PJ to bring the hookup.

GOOFY
Oh, okay.

PETE
Great!...PJ!!

PJ appears in the doorway, straining under the weight of a
huge, multipart tube. Pete points him toward the room,

instructing him to hook it up. Goofy and Max stand speechless
and wide-eyed at the sight.

PETE
Hey, Goof...why don't you order us a
pizza, this might take a while.

INT. GOOFY AND MAX'S HOTEL ROOM

The scene switches to an exterior shot of the inn to indicate
the passage of time. The we see the interior of the room
again. Max and PJ are sitting on the bed and the floor,

respectively, talking. Goofy enters in a swimsuit and carrying
a pizza for them to eat.

PJ
No, you ma-

(gasp)

GOOFY
Here you go, kids...I'm gonna go
check out the hot tub.

PJ
Oh, okay, sir.

MAX
Alright.

Goofy leaves the room as Max and PJ start eating.

PJ
I can't believe you, man. Whatever
made you think your Dad would fall
for a stupid idea like that?

MAX
It wasn't stupid!

66.

While they are talking, Pete begins to enter the room to
talk to them. He hears what they're talking about and decides
to stay outside and eavesdrop on their conversation.

PJ
Come on, it was really stupid!
Changing the map!?

MAX
I-I didn't know what I was doing,
alright? I-I-I was...I was PANICKED!
I...

EXT. HOT TUB

The hot tub is surrounded by a high fence topped with flaming
torches and various plants. Goofy eases himself into the
steamy water. A soft green glow similar to the one in the
room shines from in the water. He begins to relax, and sinks
under the surface of the water. After a few moments, a large
figure appears above him. He sits up and sees Pete standing
over him in a small, tight, pink swimsuit.

PETE
Takin' a break from the "MTV"
generation, huh? Heh heh...I can't
blame ya...

Pete gets in the water, and much of it splashes out over the
edges.

PETE
People are always puttin' too much
water in these things...so, umm...you
and your son seem to be, uh, gettin'
along just hunky-dorey, huh?

GOOFY
Yeah! It's been great! You know,
it's funny, but none of your
techniques worked for me. The harder
I tried, the worse it got. Once I
eased up, things just clicked.

Goofy gets up and moves toward Pete. He sits on the stairs
near the handrail and begins to relax, sinking back into the
water.

PETE
Oh, that's swell...so, uh, no problems
then, huh?

GOOFY

Not a one.

67.

Goofy begins to relax again, but Pete grabs his attention by
telling him about the map.

PETE
(sigh)
I just hate to be the bearer of bad
news, but...uh...

Goofy sits back up again, nervously.

GOOFY
(curious)
What is it, Pete?

PETE
Your kid's dupin' ya.

GOOFY
(nervously)
Whaddya mean?

PETE
Well, I head the little mutant tellin'
PJ that he change the map so
that...you're headin' straight for

LA, pal.
GOOFY
(shocked)
What?
PETE

Oh, you tried, Goofy...he's just a
bad kid, that's all.

GOOFY
(calmly)
I don't believe you.

PETE
What!?

GOOFY
I don't believe you, Pete.

Goofy gets out of the hot tub and begins heading toward the
room.

PETE
Well hey, don't take my word for it -
check your map.

GOOFY
I don't need to check the map...I
trust my son.

68.

He begins to turn away, but decides to tell Pete what he
thinks.

GOOFY
You know, maybe Max isn't all the
things that you think a son should
be, but...he loves me.

PETE
(angrily)
Hey...my son RESPECTS me...

GOOFY
(quietly)
Yeah...

PETE
Check the map, Goof...

INT. GOOFY'S CAR

Goofy walks away from the hot tub slowly. He approaches the
car and their room, and gets in the car. As he opens the
door, the green glow momentarily succumbs to the bright,
white light from the car's dome light. He shuts it again and
the green glow returns. He sits in the driver's seat and
begins reaching for the glove compartment to check the map.
He decides not to do it and hits the steering wheel in
frustration. As he does this, the glove compartment pops
open, revealing the map.

INT. GOOFY AND MAX'S HOTEL ROOM

After a brief shot of the exterior of the Neptune Inn, we
see Max and PJ still watching TV when Goofy walks in looking
shell-shocked. Max turns around and greets him cheerfully
and unknowingly.

MAX
Hi Dad!

The only sound to be heard is the voice of Powerline on TV.

POWERLINE
...even if I gotta shout out loud...

Unnerved, Max tries to improve the situation.

MAX
Sorry about the mess...I-I'll clean
it up...

Max looks at PJ and shrugs, confused. Goofy is still silent
as he turns the lights off and lays down in bed.

69.

PJ
I think I'd better go...

MAX
See ya, Peej!

PJ
Don't forget..."Powerline"!

MAX
Shhhhhhhh!

INT. GOOFY'S CAR

Goofy and Max are driving down the road in silence. Goofy
still has the same shocked expression on his face. Goofy
decides to give Max a chance to make the right choice, and
hopes to avoid a confrontation. They exchange uncomfortable
looks.

GOOFY
Well, here you go, navigator...just
follow my route on the map, son.

MAX
Okay, uh, umm...uh...

Max looks nervously at the map, then up at the signs
indicating the upcoming junction, which are zipping overhead.

GOOFY
Here comes our junction...

Max still mumbles, undecided as they careen toward the center
divider on the highway.

GOOFY
Okay, Max...now this is it: left or
right?

MAX
Umm...uhh...

GOOFY
Come on, Max!!

MAX
Aaaaaahhhhh!....LEFT!!

Goofy lurches the car to the left, and hits the center divider
in the process.

MAX
Oh...

70.

MAX
(sigh)
...Uh, how ‘bout a song, Dad?

Goofy sinks lower and lower - getting angrier and angrier -
as Max continues to try to pretend nothing's happening.

MAX
Uh, a game? A game! Yeah! Yeah, a
game! Okay, uh...man or woman? Man?
Man...okay, uh...Walt Disney!

Finally, Goofy snaps. He veers off the road into a scenic
lookout point and stops the car. He opens the door and
struggles to get out while wearing a seat belt. He releases
it and storms away, and begins looking out over the edge.
Max decides to try to make amends and approaches Goofy.

MAX
(sigh)
Dad, uh, listen...about my
directions...

Goofy turns away twice, refusing to acknowledge him.

MAX

Can you listen to me? I gotta tell
you something, Dad!

GOOFY
(angrily)
Why bother? I'm probably too stupid
to understand, anyway, right?

MAX
(disgusted)
Forget it!

Max walks back to the car, kicks the tire angrily, then leans
against the rear bumper. After a moment, the car rolls out
from behind him and he falls to the ground with a thud. He

looks back to see what happened and realizes that the car is
rolling away.

MAX
(surprised)
Oof!...H-h-hey! The car!

GOOFY
(angrily)
What? Now you wanna drive, too?

MAX
No, Dad! The car! Look!

71.

GOOFY
The car!

Both of them begin running after the car, frantically.

GOOFY
What'd you do now, Max?
MAX
I didn't do anything, Dad! I only

touched it!

The car passes under a low-hanging rock formation, and all
their luggage is knocked off of the roof. A skateboard flies
off and lands on the road in front of Goofy - who
inadvertently steps on it. Max jumps on the back of the board
and rides with him. They zip back and forth, trying to get
around the side of the car.

GOOFY
Oh, ohhhh...whoa! You locked it!

Goofy grabs onto the driver's side of the car and tries to
open the door, but it's locked.

MAX
I locked it!? It's your door, you
locked it!

Max leaves Goofy hanging on and manages to get to the
passenger side door. He opens it and gets in the car. He
unlocks the driver's side door and it opens, swinging Goofy
out over the canyon. Max pulls the door shut again, and opens
the window for Goofy to get through.

GOOFY
Well, you distracted me!...whoa!!

Max pulls Goofy into the car up to his waist, and he loses
his pants.

MAX
You should've put the brake on!

GOOFY
Why don't you just put it on yourself!

Goofy grabs the brake lever and pulls it to stop the car,
but it breaks off in his hand.

MAX
See? You ruin everything...

The car slides out on the guide rail and hangs over the
canyon.

72.

GOOFY
Well, you ruined the vacation!

MAX
I ruined it!?

The guide rail lets loose and the car gets launched into the
air. It bounces off of several rock formations while Max
continues to argue with Goofy, bouncing them both around the
car's interior.

MAX
I never...wanted to go...on this
stupid...vacatioooooooooooon!

The car bounces off the last rock formation, then plummets a
long way before landing in the river below.

EXT. CAR IN CHURNING RIVER

MAX

(gaSp)
Now look where you got us, Dad!

GOOFY
Where *I* got us!?

They both struggle to get back on the car. Goofy boosts Max
up onto its roof.

MAX
You should've let me stay at home!

Max helps pull Goofy onto the roof.

GOOFY
Why? So you'd end up in prison?

MAX
Prison? What are you talking about?

The car bounces and spins wildly through a series of rapids.

GOOFY
Your principal called me! You even
lied to me!

MAX
I had to! You were ruining my life!

GOOFY
I was only tryin' to take my boy
fishin', okay?

73.

MAX
I'm NOT your little boy anymore!
I've grown up! I've got my own life

now!

GOOFY
I KNOW that! I just wanted to be
part of it!

The car slides over a small waterfall into calm water. The
car stops bobbing and the sun begins shining on them.

GOOFY
You're my son, Max...no matter how
big you get, you'll always be my
son...

Goofy and Max sit with their backs to each other in silence
as the car continues to float gently through the canyon.
Birds fly overhead and soft music begins. Max breaks the
silence.

MAX
There are times you drive me, shall
we say, bananas...and your mind is
missing, no offense, a screw.

GOOFY
None taken.

The car floats into a cavern with blue ripples reflecting
onto its ceiling from the water.

MAX
Still whatever mess I land in, who
is always understandin'? Nobody else

but you...

GOOFY
Oh your moodiness is now and then
bewilderin'...and your values may

be, so to speak, askew...

MAX
Gesunheit!

GOOFY
Thanks!

MAX

Who deserves a hero's trophy, as we
face each catastrophe? Nobody else
but you...

The car exits the cavern into a slow, wide part of the river.

74.

GOOFY & MAX
Nobody else but you, it's just our
luck, we're stuck together. Nobody
else but you, it's crazy enough to
believe we'll come through.

They both take off their shoes and splash the water with
their feet.

MAX
So your jokes are all, let's face
it, prehistoric.

GOOFY
And your music sounds like monkeys
in a zoo.

GOOFY & MAX
But when life become distressin',
who will I be SOS'n?

A small fish grabs Max's toe and he lifts it out of the water
momentarily. Goofy lifts up his foot to find that a huge,
ugly fish has swallowed it. He quickly shakes it off and
sends it flying.

MAX
If you're having trouble guessing,
here's a clue...Though he seems
intoxicated, he's just highly
animated...and he's nobody else but...

The car drifts into a whirlpool, and they get drawn under as
they sing.

GOOFY & MAX
Nobody else but you, we've turned
into a true blue duo. Hard times,
we've had a few...like we're thrown
in the drink, like we're tossed out
of town, but when I start to sink,
hey I'd rather go down...

The car resurfaces with a splash and bobs up and down.

GOOFY & MAX
With nobody else, but Y-O-U!

GOOFY
(smooch)

MAX
Aw, Dad!

75.

EXT. CAR IN CALM RIVER

MAX
Anyway, I figure she's never gonna
want to talk to me again...much less
go out with me...
(sigh)
...what a dumb lie, huh?

GOOFY
Well whaddya know...my Maxie, in
love! Huh... Gosh, you're really

growin' up. Happened so fast, I guess
I sorta missed it.

The water around the car becomes increasingly choppy and the
light fades.

Max looks
vanishing
for it.

GOOFY
Wellp, I think the only thing for us
to do now is to get you up onstage
with this Powerline feller...

MAX
Heh...uh, how are we gonna do that?

GOOFY
Now you just leave that up to me...

MAX
No, Dad, really...I-I think we should,
you know, just forget it.

GOOFY
Now how come you always think I'm
gonna lead you into some sort of
calamity?

downstream and does a doubletake. The water is
over a waterfall, and the car is heading directly

MAX
Uh, uh, D-D-Dad...

GOOFY
What's wrong now?

MAX
Look!!

GOOFY

Hyuk! A waterfall...WATERFALL!?!?

76.
EXT. CAR IN RAPIDS

The car spins and sloshes, and Goofy falls off. Max continues
to hold on.

GOOFY & MAX
(frightened)
AAAHHHH!!!

Max is quickly carried downstream on the car, leaving Goofy
behind.

MAX
Daaaaaaad!

GOOFY
Max!

The current slams Goofy against a rock and he grabs onto it.
Some of their luggage floats by, including the fishing rod's
case, which hits him in the back of the head. Goofy gets the
fishing rod out and runs downstream on the rocks. He runs
out on a log, in hopes of being able to get Max with the
pole.

GOOFY
Grab a hold, Max!

Goofy holds out the end of the pole. Max dives for it but
misses, landing back in the water with the car. Goofy stands
helplessly as Max continues to float toward the falls.

MAX
Aah!...whoa!...

(gaSp)
...aaahhh!!

Goofy casts the line and snags the front bumper on the car.
The weight of the car pulls Goofy in. He flies downstream
and hits some rocks which he uses for leverage. Finally the
weight of the car overpowers him and it goes over the falls.
Max gets caught in a tarp and falls with it. Suddenly the
tarp unfolds and begins supporting Max in the air using the
updraft from the falls.

MAX
(terrified)
Dad!

Goofy, still in the water, is unable to stop himself. As he
goes over the falls, he extends the pole toward Max. Max

grabs the pole, and they both swing downward - still supported
by the updraft on the tarp. They smile at each other
momentarily. Suddenly, the cork handgrip on the fishing pole
slides off and Goofy plummets into the mist below.

77.

GOOFY
(falling)
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!

Max looks at the end of the pole and thinks about The Perfect
Cast. Without hesitation he attempts to perform it.

MAX
(hurriedly)
Ten o'clock, two o'clock, quarter to
three, touchate, twist, I'm a little
tea pot and FLY!

Max sends the line flying after Goofy.

GOOFY
(falling)
AAHHHH!

The line is still loose and continuing to drop. Max's face
falls when he realizes it hasn't caught. Suddenly the line
becomes taut and Max gets pulled downward with the added
weight. He begins to reel it in furiously. Goofy emerges
from the mist suspended by the hook.

MAX
Aah!...aaahh!
(grunt)
Haha!!

GOOFY
(sentimentally)
The Perfect Cast...

Max and Goofy grab one another firmly and hug. Both have
tears in their eyes.

As they embrace, Goofy's map lands on his head. He lifts it
up and looks at it.

MAX
Boy, this has been one crazy
vacation...

He tosses the map away, and it is carried off into the wind.

GOOFY
And it's not over yet...

EXT. STADIUM IN LOS ANGELES
The scene opens with a helicopter shot of the stadium where

the concert is being held. Their care searchlights beaming
all around and a blimp circling.

78.

People are crowding in past the turnstiles and filling the
parking lot.

INT. BACKSTAGE

The backstage crew is unloading equipment into the stadium.
Max and Goofy have hidden in some of the instrument cases,
and they are carried into the loading area. When the door
closes, they emerge.

MAX
(whispering)
Dad?

Goofy grabs Max by the arm and pulls him along. Max frees
himself and stops, worried.

GOOFY
Oof! We made it!...Come on,
Max...let's get you onstage...

MAX
Uhh...maybe this isn't such a good
idea.

POWERLINE (V.O.)
Yeah, yeah!

Two attractive dancers walk in front of Max, and he has a
change of heart. He watches them walk by, and loses sight of
Goofy.

MAX
Uh, then again...Dad?...Dad?

Onstage, the lights dim as a giant sphere is lifted up.
Electricity arcs all around the sphere and it explodes,
leaving only Powerline in its place. He stands up and begins
the song.

POWERLINE

Got myself a notion, one I know that
you'll understand. To set the world
in motion, by reaching out for each
other's hand. Maybe we'll discover
what we should have known all along.
One way or another together's where
we both belong...

Still backstage, Max is looking for Goofy when he sees
Powerline and the dancers performing onstage, and stops to
watch. A guard spies him and tries to catch him, but Max
dives through the guard's legs and runs away.

79.

Dad?

GUARD
What are you doin' here?...Hey!

Goofy is looking for Max when he accidentally looks into the
dressing room of a very heavy background singer. She screams
and punches him back out the door. He falls backwards into
some of the stage equipment and gets tangled.

GOOFY
Max?...Max?

LADY
Eeeeeeek!

Powerline and the dancers continue their performance onstage.

POWERLINE
If we listen to each other's hearts,
we'll find we're never too far apart,
and maybe love is the reason why for
the first time ever we're seeing it
I2I. Love is always seeing it
I2I...I2I we're seeing it, seeing
it...I2I...

INT. STACEY'S HOUSE

The camera closes in on Powerline's face, then pulls back
again as a TV image in Stacey's house. Her party is in full
swing, with everyone watching the concert. Everyone is
watching for Max, but Bobby doubts that he'll show up. Stacey
tries to reassure Roxanne, but her concerned look belies her
words.

BOBBY
That Goof kid ain't there!

STACEY
Don't worry, he'll be there...

POWERLINE
Love is always seeing it I2I...I2I
we're seeing it, seeing it...I2I...

INT. BACKSTAGE

The guard in pursuit of Max makes a lunge and misses. Max
grabs onto a lighting scaffold that is being lifted into
position. Goofy, trapped inside another of the pyrotechnic
spheres, is being lifted onto the stage. The sphere arcs and
explodes like Powerline's, and Goofy is sent flying onto the

80.

stage. He lands onstage beside Powerline with the tip of his
hair still flaming. Powerline gives him a curious look.

GOOFY
Excuse me...Max? Ooh! Aaaaahhh!

Max is mortified, but has a brainstorm.

MAX
Hey Dad! Dad! Do the Perfect Cast!

Goofy hears him and begins performing the motions of The
Perfect Cast, much to the amazement of Powerline and the
audience. Powerline continues the song and Goofy dances with
him.

POWERLINE
If you're ever lonely - stop, you
don't have to be; after all it's
only a beat away from you to me.

SINGERS
Take a look inside and see.

The guard climbs on the scaffolding to catch Max. Max bumps
one of the lights, and the beam gets in the guard's eyes. He
falls backwards, and his weight is too much for it. The
scaffolding breaks loose, Max grabs a rope, the guard grabs
Max by the legs, and they both swing downward.

MAX
Whoa! Whoaaaaahhhh!

The guard flies into one of the large monitors, smashing it
in a wild shower of sparks and light. Max swings back, and
ends up sliding onto the stage. He comes to rest directly
between Goofy and Powerline. They both look surprised
momentarily, then Max begins to dance and they join him.

POWERLINE

If we listen to each other's hearts,
we'll find we're never too far apart,
and maybe love is the reason why for
the first time ever we're seeing it
I2I...seeing it I2I...seeing it
I2I...for the first time ever,
I2I...for the first time...

(repeat and digress)

INT. STACEY'S HOUSE

Everyone at Stacey's party watches excitedly as Max dances
onscreen. Roxanne smiles gleefully.

81.

BOBBY
Yeah! Max is on the tu-ube! That's
Max! I know him!

INT. PETE'S RV

PJ is scrubbing the floor of the RV near the television when
he sees Max. Pete walks by drinking a beer and hears PJ
yell. He looks at the screen and spits his drink all over it
out of shock. PJ keeps watching Max through the fizz running
down the screen while Pete coughs and chokes.

PJ
He did it!

INT. STACEY'S HOUSE

Bobby, Stacey and Roxanne are dancing with the music - as is
everyone else.

Bobby sprays his cheese at Stacey and Roxanne, and bumps
into someone. He drops his squeeze cheese and bends to pick
it up. At the same time, Stacey reaches for it and touches
his hand. They look into each other's eyes and smile.

BOBBY & STACEY
Ha ha ha!

INT. ONSTAGE

The song ends to a round of applause. The applause slowly
fades into the next scene, back on Roxanne's street.

INT. GOOFY'S CAR

The car is approaching Roxanne's house slowly. It is dented,
crushed, smoking, and has no doors.

GOOFY
You're doin' the right thing, son.

MAX
Yeah, I know...but she'll probably
never talk to me again.

GOOFY
Well, if she doesn't, maybe she's
just not the one for you.

MAX
That's what I'm afraid of...

82.
EXT. ROXANNE'S FRONT PORCH

Max rings the doorbell and is met by Roxanne's father wearing
a bath towel.

ROXANNE'S FATHER
Grrrrrrrrrr....

MAX
Uh, hi! ‘Member me?

Not at all happy with seeing Max, he slams the door in Max's
face. Roxanne comes to the door and opens it again.

ROXANNE
(excitedly)
Daddy!...Max? I saw you on TV! You
were great!
MAX
(sadly)
Yeah?...I mean no, no...I mean

I...Roxanne, I lied to you. I don't
even KNOW Powerline.

ROXANNE
What are you talking about? A billion
people saw you dance with him.

MAX
Yeah, well...I-I never met
him...before the concert, that is.

Max walks over to the banister and picks a flower from a
nearby bush.

ROXANNE
(dismayed)
You mean that story about Powerline
and your Dad...why would you make up
something like that?

MAX
I don't know...I guess I just...wanted
you to like me.

ROXANNE
I already liked you, Max...from the
very first time I heard you laugh..."A-

hyuk"...heh...
Max hangs his head, embarrassed.

ROXANNE
So, you wanna do something tonight?

83.
MAX
Definitely! Oh! Oh, no, I can't, I
can't...

Roxanne shoots him a disdainful look.

ROXANNE
(doubting)
What?
MAX

Well, I'm kinda doin' something with
my Dad. Honest! How about tomorrow?

ROXANNE
Deal!

Roxanne extends her arm to shake hands, and Max surprises
her with a quick kiss. Both giggle.

MAX
(smooch)
Hmmhmm...
ROXANNE
Heh heh...

Max accidentally laughs like Goofy again, and covers his
mouth in embarrassment.

MAX
A-h-h-h-hyuk!

Their conversation is interrupted by loud bangs from the
street. Goofy is attempting to put the front bumper of the
car back in place while humming "Open Road". He grins back
at them and gestures humorously at the car.

Without warning, the car explodes, leaving only Goofy's shoes
and socks behind as he sails through the air.

GOOFY
Do do dooo...do do do doo...ah-ho-
hoooey!

Roxanne and Max cringe simultaneously as Goofy crashes through
the roof on Roxanne's porch.

GOOFY
A-h-h-hyuk!

Max smiles and introduces them.

84.

MAX
Roxanne...I'd like you to meet my
Dad.

Roxanne smiles and Goofy kisses her hand.

GOOFY
Enchante, Mademoiselle
(smack)

ALL
Hee hee hee...

They all giggle as the camera pans up past the house, the
trees and into the clouds.

The screen goes black abruptly as "I2I" begins and the credits
roll.
