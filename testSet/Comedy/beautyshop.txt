MUSIC UP

FLASH of QUICK DISSOLVES: a little GIRL'S hands,
coffee—colored, slowly braid hair, pulling unruly, nappy
strands into neat rows, securing them with brightly colored
plastic bobbles. The hands DISSOLVE into a TEENAGER'S hands,
working a flat iron, pressing sections that curl in careful
waves . . .

TITLES UP

...the hands DISSOLVE into a WOMAN'S hands, a simple gold
wedding band, bracelets. They move quickly now, lightening
speed, expert as they weave in strands of long hair to short,
broken ends.

RADIO FADES UP as the hands DISSOLVB again. The ring is still
there, the professional quickness. Only now the hair they
work is BLOND and long, smoothed out into a silken sheet.

RADIO
(female DJ)

..another my heart's been broke
ballad from Justin. She was a
virgin, Justin. How freaky could
THAT have been? You need to get
with some honeys that have been
around. Show you how to turn it
outi

We PULL BACK to reveal GINA MORRIS, whose hands we've been
watching. Gina smiles, shakes her head at the radio. There's
a sexy, playful spark to her...and behind that a kind of
innate wisdom.

The blond she's been working on is seated in plush, back
alcove at JORGE CRISTOPHE‘S upscale salon. Gina works with
her own little radio playing next to her, the rest OI the
shop is pumping Enya. Next to the radio is a framed
PHOTOGRAPH of Gina at her SISTER'S Beauty Shop in Chicago:
the whole crew, plus Calvin, posing for a neighborhood shot.

Past her, we can see the salon. It's softly lit, flowers,
mirrors and gold trim everywhere. White women are in various
stages of getting their hair done, one with her head back '

a sink, another covered in foils: a diamond collared
chihuahua harks incessantly at the blow dryer being used “n
her OWNER. The STYLlST just grins, icily, and tries to ignore
it. Evian bottles and Cappuccinos are evident next to each
well—pampered client. Gina is the only black hairstylist
patron) in the place.

RADIO
(continuing)
Besides, you wanna sing like a
black man? You better kick those
little white girls to the curb,
Mr. Heartethrobe

GINA
Oh, no, she didn't! She did NOT go
there!

LYNN, (20's) is a wash girl at Jorge's: Georgiawborn, a
country girl, her accent is so think NO ONE can understand
her except Gina.

LYNN

She did! Oh, she went there,

around the block... and back again!
RADIO

...you all know that's the biggest
play out there. "My heart's
broken. Come here and hold ma
dick!"

Gina laughs out loud. Lynn doubles over. JOANNE MARCUS, the
blond, society girl (early 20's) Gina's been werking on,
raises her head. Joanne is a Paris Hilton wannabe: a young
Louis Vuitton sales rep with society aspirations and quasi-
celebrity friends.

JOANNE
Did she just say what I THlNK she
said?

Joanne grabs her cellrphone, dials a number.

. GINA
See, that's my GIRL! Lisa L. 2103.
Nobody back in Chicago'd go off
like this. She doesn't hold back.

LYNN
Mmm—Hmmm. That woman has the guts
to say whatever she thinks—

GINA
Right?

JOANNE
(into phone)

Nicole, Doesn‘t your father OWN
that station, that rapswhatever
one? Can you say 'dick‘ on the
radio? Really? .. I'm at
Jorge's... When? He's DJing? I
can't go...shit! No, I'm getting
my implants done—

GINA
NO, no. Joanne, don't do that—

JOANNE
Dr. Kopelin says a week to
recover ..yeah. He‘s loading me up

with vicodin. Sure. I'll get
extra. Yeah, I‘ll see you.

She hangs up.

GINA
Don't do it, girl. Don't get
implants. You're a young,
beautiful girl—

JOANNE
Look at YOU!

GINA

(sticking her chest

out)
These are one hundred percent
authentic, okay? Mind you, I LIKE
having some cleavage, but I've
seen too many girls with those
fake, rock—hard titties that don't
look right. One of them ends up
moving to your neck, or it starts
floating around to the back-

JOANNE
(cracking up)
Stop! Get OUT!

Joanne stands_up, shakes her head and turns to look in the
mirror. She gasps, both hands over her mouth. Her hair has
been blown out, pressed into a sleek Japanese sheet of hair.
She shakes her head, loving it.

JOANNE
(continuing)
Oh my God! GINA!

Gina smiles, proudly, making a few final adjustmenis to the
hair. Other stylists in the front are peering in. JORGE
CRISTOPHE, the long—haired salon owner, gets up from ti" stir
in front. He thinks he's a black Jose Eber, Warren HLQLLY in
Shampoo. He's an arrogant selleout, a womanizing s‘i . Ho
glances in on Gina, just a quick look, but it burns wiih a
muted jealousy. '

JOANNE
(continuing)
I‘ve never had anyone get this cut
and the extensions just right.
That stuff of yours is
amazing...and believe me, I've
tried everything.

Gina grins.

GINA
That's an old family recipe that
I’ve messed with a little. All I‘m
gonna say is there's Avocado oil
and a little bacon fat in the mix.

Outside, we see a Jaguar pull up. The valet opens the door
for a Donna Karan—clad society wife, TERRI GREEN (mid

30's's). She fumbles for the keys, almost drops them. She
smiles, embarrassed, slips a ten dollar bill to the valet.

Jorge stands at the door, waiting. He puts an arm around
Terri, whispers semething in her ear, smiling, charming her
as he leads her to the back, pressing close.

JORGE
(to Gina)
Terri's here...

GINA
(under her
breath)
Jorge, I have to leave at four.
I need to pick Valerie up from
school-

Jorge gives her a cold shrug.

JORGE
What can I do? She wanted you...

His diction is perfect: his charming, sexy attitude dissolves
around Gina. Gina takes a deep breath, trying to keep it
together.

TERRI
Gina l

She turns to Terri. Takes a beat and smiles, genuinely glad
to see her.

GINA
Terri! My girl!

TERRI
I just had the most AMAZING chakra
treatment. Gina, T have to take
you to see my healer.

Lynn hands her an Evian and a robe. She immediately pulls out
a massive vial of pills and downs a couple. Smiles
apologetically.

TERRI
(continuing)
It's not...what it looks like.
They‘re herbal anti—toxins.

GINA
I'll be right with you, Terri.
Just relax.

Gina picks up her cell phone and dials, trying to keep it

together.

GINA
(continuing)
Aunt Paulette? I need a favor.
Yeah. I‘m not getting outa here
'till late—

Terri is gazing at Joanne's hair.

TERRI
Joanne! You look gorgeous!
(to Gina)
That is beautiful!

Joanne smiles, can't take her eyes off herself.

JOANNE
(to Gina)
I got to run...
(to Terri)
I got your bag in. Come by the
store tomorrow?

She flashes Terri a dazzling smile and spins out.

Gina aside:

JORGE
(out of earshot)
What did you do to Joanne Marcus's
hiulites? It‘s WHITE blond! I told
you, CARMEL highlighter

GINA
(to Jorge)
Hey, she asked for that. She likes
it.

JORGE
She's going to a trade show at
Saks with "Jorge" hair, do you
understand?

Jorge pulls

GINA
Yeah, you want her to represent.
But I gotto say, I think the ultra—
blond is very Versace, very Gwen
Stefani—

JORGE
Don't question me, girl. You're
here to carry out my vision, you
understand?

Gina turns, eyebrows raised, to give him a LOOK, but he's
turned to leave. As he does, he reaches back and shuts off
her radio.

JORGE
(continuing)
I told you I don't want that
ghetto shit in here.

He spins and walks out, his distinctive, LONG HAIR tossed
back.

LYNN
Pay him NO mind...

Gina looks at her, nods, appreciating the solidarity. She's
so furious she can barely speak.

GINA
(aside, to Lynn)
Hey. I FEEL for him. Who was his
last big client? Jane Fonda?

Lynn cracks up.

LYNN
He's all hat and no cattle.
GINA
”All hat and no cattle." I like
that.
TERRI

Gina? Did you bring the stuff?

Gina reaches into a drawer and pulls out a jelly ial til‘wd
with some kind of opaque goo.

GINA
You know I did...

TERRI
Thank godl

GINA
Look at you! You look gorgeous.

TERRI
Liar. But, bless you.

Gina starts on Terri, wetting her hair and slathering the
goop trom her jar on.

'I‘ E RRI
(continuing)
I swear, the best thing Jorge ever
did was to give you a chair
here...what, about a year ago?

GINA
Moved from Chicago just six months
ago—

TERRI

Ts that all?

GINA
*six LONG months.

Gina laughs.
TERRI

How's your daughter? Where does
she go again?

GINA
Atlanta Music and Art Children‘s
school.

TERRI
You have to auditiOn for that,
right?

GINA

One out of three hundred kids who
audition get in. We moved here as
soon as we heard she got in—

Jorge sticks his head back in.
JORGE
Gina. Don't forget I need you in
early. In Style magazine is doing

a piece on the salon and we have
three models to style—

Gina doesn't respond, just nods in a muted rage.

CUT TO:

INT. GINA‘S HOUSE — CASCADE ROW, "SWATS" 7 NIGHT

Gina is standing in her kitchen, food cooking on the stove
while she does her AUNT PAULETTE'S hair. Aunt Paulette is a
young, fifty—something, sharp and stylish.

DARNELLE, (25) Gina‘s cousin, a buck—wild party girl, sits to
one side, looking out the window, clearly waiting for someone
or something: NOT wanting to be here with her mother.
VALERIE, Gina‘s nine year old daughter, is sitting on the
floor, reading a giant tome: HISTORY OF MUSIC. They are mid
conversation.

GINA
(going ofﬂ
He's just mad as hell that there's
ANOTHER talented, black person in
his universe. Not that HE'S all
that talented. It kills him when
ladies ASK for me.

PAULETTE
I don't know how you do it.
GINA
How I do it is... I do it for HER.

(re: Valerie)

PAULETTE
I know that school is not cheap.

GINA
What he's GOOD at is making a girl
feel special, like you got IN
somewhere there was a line. You
walk out of there looking fly,
looking DONE UP.

AUNT PAULETTE
YOU'RE the one making him look
good.

DARNELLE
You gettin' robbed, Gina.

GINA
Trust me, when I open MY spot, I'm
gonna be glad I worked there. I
learned a thing or two from Jorge.
That's what I want. The kind of
place you go in, you teel
pampered, taken care of—

PAULETTE
Girl's got to LOVE that.

GINA
sand then the next step is you
have your own line of products.
That's where he's not thinking
ahead. I'm gonna develop a line of
high quality boutique—

PAULETTE
—expensive-

GINA
—hair products with my name on
them. Okay? Everything represents
the experience you had
there. ._your experience becomes
the brand.

DARNELLE
And you make a cute paycheck from
selling these products—

PAULETTE
And what would YOU know about a
"cute" paycheck?

DARNELLE

—I‘m getting taken care off
PAULETTE

Yeah. That's the problem right

there*
Valerie looks up from her book.

VALERIE
What's a "novelty act?"

They all look at her.

PAULETTE
Tt‘s...an act that's different.
Fun.

VALERIE

It says here, before the forties,
all the women who were musicians
were novelty acts.

GINA
That means they weren't taken
seriously.

Valerie nods. Gina and Aunt Paulette exchange a LOOK. The kid
can be WAY too serious.

She looks

VALERIE
All the great composers were men.
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart.

up at Gina with a vaguely pained expression.

VALERIE
(continuing)
Where were the girls?

GINA
Having babies. Doin' Mozart and
Bach's laundry.

VALERIE
There were no kids like me?

PAULETTE
Sugar, there STILL are no kids
like you—

GINA
Girls like you grew up and married
Mozart and Bach and got their
ideas stolen while they were
pushing out babies.

PAULETTE
So, take a lesson from your Mama
and always represent YOURSELF.

GINA
Not many men out there like your
Daddy was. Respectful, supportive-

Valerie sighs, puts her book down.

VALERIE
Can we go?

GINA
In a minute.

Gina turns Paulette around, motions to her hair. She's
cropped it in a short, elegant do.

Gina nods.

GINA
(continuing; to
Valerie)

What d'you think?

VALERIE
(very serious)
It's a little bit too Halle Berry
at the Osears.

ll.

GINA
But it works for her?

VALERIE
Definitely.

Paulette gets up, looks in the mirror and smiles.

PAULETTE
Perfect] I LOVE it!

She pulls a set of keys out of her bag.

PAULETTE
(continuing; to Gina)
Here the church keys, baby. I'll
see you later.

Gina gives her a big hug.

GINA
Thanks, Auntie. I appreciate you
letting Valerie practice there.

Outside, we see a tricked out Chevy pull up. A bandanna'd,
GANGSTA—type at the wheel. Darnelle jumps up out of her
chair, checks herself in the mirror, tugging at a skinmtight
mini and top.

PAULETTE
Got to be proud of SOMEONE.

Darnelle sighs, ignoring her mother: she's used to these
pointed remarks.

GINA
(aside; to Darnelle)
That‘s your date?

DARNELLE
Mnrdlmnt
GINA
Cuz. Home—boy looks like a world

of trouble.

DARNELLE
(out of Paulette‘s
earshot}
That boy is feeling it, okay? And
he's got bank, and we're goin‘ OUT.

GINA
You are crazy, girl.

l2.

DARNELLE
He's got a friend, Gina. Fine
looking young mane

Gina lances down at Valerie, who's listenin .
q

GINA
You better GO, Darnelle.

Aunt Paulette shakes her head, turious, as she watches
Darnelle wave good—bye and climb into the Chevy. Valerie
stares at her mother.

GINA
(continuing)
Get your things. You've got an
hour to practice before dinner...

CUT TO:
INT. AME CHURCH — NIGHT

Church is empty. Valerie has started to play: warming up with
scales and then launching into a Mozart sonata. She is
shockingly good. Gina can't help but smile, gaze at her _
proudly. She sips on a cold soda and sits down next to her
daughter on the piano bench, moved and captured by her

playing.

VALERIE
(still playing)
Are you gonna start 'dating' and
all?

GINA
What gave you that idea?

VALERIE
In sex ed, they said all mammals
have sexual needs—

GINA
Except your Mama—

VALERIE
eand mating rituals.

GINA
You wanna talk about sex? Fine.
Ask me anything. But you do NOT
need to know about my...social
life.

She gives her a wink. Valerie starts playing again, her brow
furrowed as she concentrates. Something is bothering her.

l3.

GINA
(continuing; gently)
I don't think I‘m ready to date,
Valerie.
(a beat)
No one's EVER gonna replace your
Daddy. Okay?

OFF Valerie's quick, grateful glance, we—
INT. JORGE CRISTOPHE'S — DAY

Lynn and Gina are in the back, the radio on. Lynn is shewing
Gina polaroids from a recent hair show.

GINA
YOU did that?

LYNN
Uh huh. Did a weave in front,
curled the back and laid in these
corkscrew extensionse

WE can't understand a thing she says but Gina seems to,
nodding and looking at the pictures.

GINA
You should get a chair here, Lynn.

LYNN
You think the Captain ovah there
would let my backwoods ass near
these ladies-

GINA
I'monna talk to him—

Behind them we can see a crew setting up to do the In Style
shoot. Gina picks up her apron and puts it on.

CUT TO:
INT. JORGE CRISTOPHE'S — LATER

A gorgeous, coltish MODEL is sitting on a plush fur draped
couch, decked out head to toe in YSL. Gina is styling

hair, putting in soft layers around a fabulous, upswtcp
creation. Next to her, Jorge works on another model. The In
Style fashion EDITOR glances at Jorge's work and then LVIHS
in on Gina's mode].

EDITOR
i LOVE this.

Jorge hovers behind her, arms crossed, watching.

14.

EDITOR
(continuing)
Jorge? I want to shoot this. Right
here, in the chair. We can get the
whole salon in the background.

The photographer steps in, ready to take the shot.

EDITOR
(continuing; to Gina)
And you are—?

JORGE
She's just an employee. I've
worked with her to developﬁ

GINA
(holding out a hand)
Gina Morris.

She smiles, proud.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Gina? Just look up for a second,
put your hand down, yeah, there,
just to the right of her
shoulder... greatl

Gina looks up, scissors in hand, ready to smile for the
camera, when Jorge steps in and takes the scissors from her,
shaking his head. He makes a little scooting motion with his
hands. The Editor and Photographer exchange a LOOK.

GINA
(slowly)
You don't want me in the picture.

JORGE
(like he's talking to
a child)
Gina. This is a piece about MY
shop—

GINA
(calmly)
But that's MY look. I just cut her
hair AND styled it~

JORGE
(whispered)
AND you wouldn't be doing shit if
I hadn't hired you.

Gina takes a deep breath, trying not to lose it, but wanting
to hold her ground.

15.

GINA
Hold on, hold on. I appreciate
working here and all, but that's
my creation. I'm just asking you
to show me some respect —

JORGE
The sign out front says Jorge
Cristophe's. Okay? You want
respect? Go open your place.

Gina stares at him. Slowly unties her apron.

GINA
You know what? I can't do this
anymore. Forget it.

There’s dead silence in the rOOm.

GINA
(continuing)
I AM gonna open my own place. And
that‘s something your NOT gonna
take credit for, 'cause I‘ve BEEN
making plans for a long time.

JORGE
Is that right?

GINA
That's right. YOU‘RE the creative
genius, go style your own shit for
once.

She drops her apron on a chair.

GINA
(continuing; calmly)
I quit.

She turns and walks away, pushes the door open, lets it slam
behind her.

JORGE
What do you know? You don't KNOW
ANYTHING!!!
(shouting)
You're gonna fall flat on your
ass, Gina!

When the camera FLASHES, he whips out a veneered, toothy
smile... just in time.

EXT. JORGE CRISTOPHE'S r CONTINUING

OFF GINA, standing alone just OUTSIDE the shop, everyone
looking after her. She freezes, shutting her eyes for a beat.

16.

The weight of the moment hits her...and then her face opens
up into a dazzling smile, the world suddenly opening up
before her as she struts off with a HelleWith-That look on
her face.

INT. GINA'S HOUSE — NIGHT

The light is dim as Gina sits in front of her computer,
poring over internet real estate listings. She looks at t
clock. It‘s two fifteen AM. The radio is on softly, just
music. Gina glances at a picture of RED, her husband; looks
back at the computer.

'15:

She peers closely at the screen, as a list pops up:

GINA
(reading)
The CLIP JOINT... D—LUX
BEAUTY...The BEAUTY CALL? BOOTY

SHOP?
She laughs, shaking her head.

GINA
(continuing)
Dang. People get crazy with these
name57

She makes a note of something, doesn't notice Valerie
standing in the doorway, in her nightgown, rubbing her eyes.

VALERIE
Mama?

GINA
Hey, Baby. What're yen doin' up?

She turns the radio down.

VALERIE
I can't sleep.

She comes over to Gina and leans onto her lap.

GINA
You gotto try, you got school
tomorrow.

VALERIE

What are you doing?
She peers at the computer.

GINA
Researching real estate and
business agentS. I'm gonna buy up
a beauty shop, baby girl.

17.

VALERIE
Really?
GINA
Our own business. Look...T did a

search on all the up and coming
neighborhoods. See? I got a list
of four shops already up for sale.

She shows Valerie another stack of papers.

GINA

(continuing)
And here‘s a business prospectus.
I did a relevant comparison with
businesses in various
areas.. projected an initial
profit and loss based on a six
chair enterprise, mid—range—

Valerie eyes glaze over. She stares at the computer.

VALERIE
Am I gonna have to leave Music
School now?

Gina looks at her.

GINA
Why would you have to leave music
school? That's the whole reason we
picked up and moved here—

VALERIE
You lost your job, Mama.

GINA
I quit, okay? I quit for something
better.

VALERIE

But what if you can't make the
same kind of money at your own
shop?

From Gina's LOOK, we know she's been worrying about the some
thing; she takes a beat, smiles, plays it off tor her
daughter.

GINA
Valerie. You have only ONE thing
to think about. School. Money is
not your problem, okay? i got that
covered.

Valerie nods.

GINA
(continuing)
Haven't we been okay?

Valerie yawns, nodding.

GINA
(continuing)
Go back to sleep. Stop thinking so
much.

She gives her a big squeeze and a hug. Gina watches the door
shut behind her, then peers at the screen again.

GINA
(continuing; reading)
"Cleopatra's Cute Cornrows and
Cuts."

She smiles, shakes her head.

GINA
(continuing)
We'll skip that one...

CUT TO:
INT. BUCKHEAD BEAUTY SALON - ATLANTA

Gina holds Valerie's hand as a business agent walks them
through a posh, spare and modern shop. it's all chrome and
lucite. The clients are all upscale, white women. The
hairstylists are too perfect, girls with fashion model looks.
Gina stops to look at a bottle of the shops' own special,
hair treatment. She examines the label and packaging with a
critical, interested eye.

VALERIE
It's very CLEAN. What do you think?

Gina turns the bottle over. Doublertakes at the price.

GINA

Honey, we can't even afford their
conditioner. I'll never get a loan

SMASH CUT:

INT. BUCKHEAD SALON 7 DAY

Another gorgeous salon. Clients wait while stylists rush
around, working and talking. Everything is red velour, gold
trim. Gina holds a folder with a description of the business
and the building, plus the price. She reads it while they
look around.

Glances down at Valerie, points to the asking price and
shakes her head.

CUT TO:
EXT. AUBURN AVE. — "SWATS" — EVENING

Gina and Valerie are standing outside of KLASSI KUTS salon,

a neighborhood beauty parlor, with a real estate/business
AGENT. The current owner, MISS ANGELINE (70's Africans
American) is showing them around. It's a local crowd: a few
older church ladies getting perms, some younger women,
talking loud and laughing. A lightnskinned, stately looking
hairdresser, ASHLEY, eyes Gina, giving her a once—over. LOLA,
the fiery Puerto Rican manicurist, exchanges a look with her.
Gina nods to them: she gets it. They are sizing her up.

MISS ANGELINE
Twenty—three years I been here..

AGENT
You'll be inheriting a well
established clientele...

MISS ANGELINE

Gina looks back at the employees, again, catching the tension
and curiosity in their exchanged looks. Lola steps up to her.
LOLA

GINA
MMm—Hmmm.
LOLA

Lola snorts, impressed, but trying to hide it.

Lola glares at her. Ashley, listening, comes over.

ASHLEY

GINA
(cool)
Poetic? Nah. Just smart.

She gives them a little nod, like, don't underestimate me,
before turning back to the agent.

AGENT
I'm sure you've noticed how these
couple of blocks are really
changing...there's a Starbucks up
on the corner, a GAP right down
the block.

Gina looks at the cracked grout on a sink.

GINA
It‘s gonna take some fixing up.

AGENT
You're lucky to get in here at
ghetto prices.

He looks at his listing.

AGENT
(continuing)
Twenty percent down...is gonna
leave you with payments around
twenty—two a month.

He holds the figures up to her. Gina looks at her own
business plan. She looks around again, looks at Valerie and
node.

GINA
That sounds...like my number.

Gina gets up, touches her hair.

GINA
This is NOT working for you.
You‘ve got great bone structure.
The bangs are cutting off your
face. You need hielites, not color.

A beat. Ms. Strugg stares at her.
GINA
(continuing)

You got a sink?

CUT TO:

INT. SOUTHERN MUTUAL SAVING AND LOAN - DAY 7 BATHROOM

Gina is doing Ms. Struggs hair. They've set up a mini parlor
in front of the stalls. Ms. Strugg is teary eyed, mid“
conversation.

MS. STRUGG
..everywhere in my life it‘s like
that. I‘m not good enough to be
promoted here, Ralph doesn't want
me cooking, says I ruin
everything. It's like my whole
self—esteem is just shot right now-

Gina hands her a tissue.

GINA
Remember what I said? If you want
it, it‘s YOURS. You got to take
it, make it happen! It's YOURS.
Say it...this shit is MINE!

MS. STRUGG
Right, right...this shit is mine.

Gina spins her around, fluffs out her now—dry hair, and faces
her to the mirror.

The woman staring back at her looks so different, Strugg
gasps. Gina's done her makeuup, too.

MS. STRUGG

I NEVER would have tried this—

GINA

MS. STRUGG

Gina smiles.

Oh, my God. You're a genius!

A beat while Gina watches her watching herself.
GINA
(calmly)
So. Yen think I'm gonna have ANY
problem making my payments?

She smiles, a sly grin. KNOWS she's got her loan.

EXT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP (KLASSI KUTS) n NIGHT

The shop is empty. Gina stands at the front door with the
keys in her hand. She looks up and down the block. Across the
street is a Radio Shacketype operation. There's a drugstore,
barber shop and a mini-mart. Gina reads the code to the
alarm, disables it and steps inside.

INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP - NIGHT

The lights are out. Gina stands alone in the dark, fiddling
with the keys. She has the wide—eyed look of a kid at
Christmastime. She flicks the dryers off and on, then tests
out the sinks, spins the chairs...and smiles.

INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP “ NIGHT

Gina is on a ladder, painting. Paulette is working on the
opposite wall. Valerie stands below her, holding a paint
tray: the old mirrors have been replaced, new sleek stainless
steel counters put in.

Through the front window, we see a tricked out, bright red
motorcycle pull up. Darnelle is straddling it. She struggles
to park it, nearly falls over. Gina and Paulette exchange a
LOOK.

GINA
I knew she'd show up.

PAULETTE
Three hours late!

Gina looks at her watch as Darnelle comes in.

DARNELLE
Gina. I'm sorry H

PAULETTE
Nice bike. Somebody buy that for
you?

DARNELLE

It's P.J.'s. He LENT it to me.

Darnelle and Paulette exchange a quick glare, muted with
unspoken hurt and resentment. Gina climbs down the ladder
excited, determined not to let these two get her down.

.

GINA
(to Paulette)
Gimme a hand with this.

Paulette helps Gina set up some glass—topped coffee tables:
Darnelle kicks back and lights a cigarette. Gina leans over
and turns up the radio. Music fills the air.

24.

Gina stands back. Even half—way finished, we can see that the
place is looking GOOD.

GINA
(continuing)
Look at this! Check it out!

She grins, proud.
GINA
(continuing)

Gina‘s Beauty Shop!

Paulette, feeling the excitement, holds out a fist. Gina t;
it and they both howl.

5-.1
"O

PAULETTE
Girl! You're doing it!

VALERIE
I helped! I helped with the chairs!

GINA
Think about it. My OWN place. All
of our peoples have always worked
for someone else—

PAULETTE
—that's true.

GINA
—never get ahead that way. I‘m
tired of being someone's GIRL.
Come on! I'm a growneass woman!

PAULETTE
Time for you to represent!

GINA
These girls are gonna come in for
work tomorrow and they're gonna be
blown away, you understand?
They're gonna be thanking their
lucky stars I bought the place...

OFF GINA, smiling, we—
SMASH CUT:
INT. GlNA'S BEAUTY SHOP — MORNING

ANGLE ON: the HAIRSTYLTSTS at Gina‘s new shop. They are
staring at the uniforms that Gina (bursting with excitement)
hands out and Lynn (from Jorge's) already has on. One of
them holds up the pencil thin Versace—esque skirt and midritt
top. (They're all in sweats and track shoes, comfortable,
low—key ghetto.)

GIRL #l
A uniform?

GIRL ﬁl
(continuing)
You want us to work with this shit
on?

_ GIRL #3
Forget this...

She grabs her bag, starts packing up her brushes and
scissors. Girl #1 does the same, and Girl #2 follows.

Gina, dressed to the nines, polished and gorgeous, watches as
they walk out. Besides Lynn, that leaves just Ashley and

Lola.
GINA
O 7 kay...

Lynn winks at her.

LYNN
Better we find the rotten ones
now. Those're two eggs should
never been laid.

Lola and Ashley stare at her.

LOLA
Say WHAT?

ASHLEY
What‘d she just say? I believe
that was english but I‘m, frankly,
baffled-

Lynn speaks slowly and clearly.

LYNN
You ALL ARE LUCKY to work for
Gina.
GINA
(regaining her
momentum)

80.. why don't you get changed—

The girls start wriggling into their uniforms. Ash.cy its}:
at herself in the mirror, seems halfnway pleased. Lola looks
pissed. Gina motions to Lynn, who does a little turn,
modeling the outfit.

26.

GINA
(continuing)
This is Lynn, everybody. She‘s
gonna have a chair here. Just got
her license but she's crazy
talented. And you know I‘m Gina.

She smiles, motioning around to the new decor

GINA
(continuing)
Nice, huh? We're gonna class this
place up a little; thing‘s are
gonna be different around here,
okay?

LOLA
(under her breath)
I wanna hear THIS.

Gina doesn't catch it. She smiles, and goes over .He icth
chalkboard with prices marked for different services and
starts to erase the amounts.

GINA
I'm gonna cut the prices —

Lola GROANS.

GINA
(continuing)
—to get more ladies in the door
initially. THEN, once we generate
some business, we can start
raising them up.

She smiles at everyone. They stare at her, un—moved.

GINA
(continuing)
I'm sure you all have your
routines here, but I'd like it it
we sharpened things up. Okay? It’s
all about the look and the the!

Ashley and Lola exchange a quick LOOK.

GINA
(COHLIHUIHQ)
I'd like it if everyone could
bring the client a water and offer
them an espresso or cappuccino as
soon as they step into their
robes...

She holds up brand new black with gold trim bathrobes.

27.

GINA
(continuing)
I'll show you all how to use the
Cappuccino machine I set up in the
kitchen. Okay? Also, no food on
the new counters.

Lola is staring at Gina with obvious hostility at this point.

GINA
(continuing)
And last...I don't want no drama

in here, okay? No boyfriends,
sisters coming in having it out
with you while you‘re at work
here. Okay? So, you got a problem,
you got semething to say...you
come to ME.

A beat.

LOLA
(under her breath)
Great. She wants a hieclass joint
at ghetto prices. Figure THAT out.

Gina steps over to Lola, smiling.

GINA
You got something you wanna say?
You can leave, too *

LOLA
(under her breath)
i can't afford to.

At that moment, Gina‘s first clients walk in: an exhausted
looking MOTHER and her little girl. Behind her, an older
woman, MRS. TOWNER, shuffles over to Ashley's.chair.

Gina goes over to the mother and her little girl.

GINA
And how can I help you, Ma'am?

The woman looks around, a little uncomfortable.

WOMAN
Isn‘t this Miss Angeline‘se

GINA
Gina's now. I'm Gina and whatever
you need-

She pushes the little girl Forward.

28.

WOMAN
She need her first perm. Lookit
this hair. Bad hair. Nappy as
hell. That's from her Daddy's
side.

Lynn stands waiting with a robe, not quite sure if a four
year old needs one.

GINA
Lynn here can take care of you.

Gina winks at the little girl, who's clearly terrified Lynn
hesitates, then puts the robe on the child. She swims in it.
Gina quickly rolls up the sleeves.

LOLA
What about her Evian? Aren‘t you
gonna get her an Evian?

Gina looks at her long and hard.

GINA
No. I‘m NOT. I'm gonna send YOU
around the corner to get her a
soda.

She pulls a couple of dollars out of her pocket,

GINA
(continuing: to
little girl)
What kind of soda do you like,
sweetheart?

GIRL
Orange.

GINA
(to Lola)
One orange soda.

Lola gets up, rolls her eyes. Gina stops her.

GINA
(continuing)
EVERYONE who comes in here gets
treated with respect, okay?
They're paying...we‘re working.

Gina leads the little girl over to Lynn's chair.
She glances over just in time to see Mrs. Towncr pop out her

false teeth and lay them in a glass by the mirrors. ’ina
shudders, but nods and smiles at her.

29.

ASHLEY
(screaming)
SAME THING, MIZ TOWNER?

MRS. TOWNER
Don' give me no Afro, girl. Jus'
keep my curls tight and neat~

Ashley nods, gets started. Gina steps over to turn the radio
on and notices a slight flickering in the lights. She frowns,
looks down at the outlets: they're old and the wiring is worn
tliiri.

GINA
Damn. Got to replace that...

She gets up as the door swings open and DENISE and ROCHELLE
step in: the wives of basketball players, they've moved on
uptown, but still have family in the old neighborhood. They
check themselves in the mirrors while they talk. Mmmemm.
Glossy lips, big jewelry, fine skin. Everything is DONE: the
latest Prada, Gucci, Chanel. It's ALL there and they know ‘

ROCHELLE
0000! Where am I?

DENISE
This ain't no Miss Angeline‘s.

ROCHELLE
New I know I still got my buzz on
from last night!

They laugh, hiefive.

DENISE
That was a party, girrrl.

Lynn steps over to Gina, whispers.
LYNN
(quietly)

You know them girls? Players
wives. Hawks. I seen them around.

She whispers a name in Gina's ear.

GINA
Really? That‘s HIS wife?

Lynn whispers another name.
GINA
(continuing)

He's a damn good player.

She looks Denise up and down.

30.

GINA
(continuing)
Home girls did good. Got
themselves ball players.

She and Lynn exchange a smile. They KNOW these kind of girls
Gina steps over with robes and water.

DENISE
Oh, that's okay. We get our hair
done at 'Aspire.‘

GINA
I know that joint. Classy place at
Peachtree mall.

ROCHELLE
.We were jus' givin‘ a shout to her
Aunt Linda, lives down the bloeke

DENISE
~thought she might be in here,
gettin' her hair done.

Gina motions for them to sit.

GINA
Lemme just put a little shine back
in your hair. You don't like it,
you don't have to pay.

The women exchange a look: why not? They jump right back into
their conversation.

DENISE
Ricky's wife had a drink in her
hand steppin‘ outa the car—

ROCHELLE
When does she NOT have a drink in
her hand?

The girls keep talking as Gina slips on their robes: they're
used to being taken care of.

DENISE
And she wonders why her man
doesn't come home after games.

ROCHELLE
Mmm—Hmm. She steps out with a crew
every night. She‘s rolling like
that.

GINA
Sounds like you ladies partied
last night?

ROCHELLE
New York. Just got back in.
DENISE
Dinner at Nohu. Then out to
Cheetah.
GINA
Well lemme take an edge off that
jet lag.

Lola comes in, drops the orange soda on the little girls lap.
Rochelle recognizes her.

ROCHELLE
Lola? You always did my nails when
I was down here!

LOLA
Hey, Rochelle. What're you doing
back in the 'hood?

ROCHELLE
Just seein' family.

LOLA
Lemme do your nails.

Lola leads her to the manicure station. Rochelle holds up a
hand, letting Lola gaze at a fat, yellow diamond. One of many.

LOLA
(continuing)
Dangl You need some muscle walkin'
around here with that on!

ROCHELLE
My man gave that to me last week.

LOLA
What happened? What he do?

Rochelle gives Lola a playful slap. Denise turns to her as
well.

DENISE
No. REALLY. 1 been wanting to ask.
What DID happen?

ROCHELLE
Please. My husband is just a very

generous man .

Lola and Denise exchange a LOOK.

32.

ROCHELLE
(continuing)
You all are EVIL.

Gina turns to Denise.

GINA
(to Denise)
I'm gonna deep condition this,
okay?

Denise nods, sits down in Gina's chair.

GINA
(continuing)
Can I get you coffee? Cappuccino?

LOLA
(under her breath)
Cappuccino? Why'd they need a
Cappuccino? She can go get them a
Coke next door.

DENISE
I'm good, I'm good.

Gina pulls out a jar of her Special Sauce and opens it up.

DENISE
(continuing)
What is THAT?

Gina smiles.

GINA
My secret weapon.

Denise looks nervous.

GINA
(continuing)
Trust me. Okay? You gonna be at
the game tonight, right? Forget
the threespointers, YOU are gonna
stand out—

CUT TO:
INT. JORGE CRISTOPHE‘S - DAY
Jorge is working in the back alcove with another STYLIST. He
takes a quick glance at Gina's empty chair, then back to his
CLIENT.
JORGE

(to client)
Let‘s wash you out...

33.

He looks around.

JORGE
(continuing)
Where is...what‘s her—name, the

wash—girl back here?

STYLIST
Lynn? Lynn went to work at Gina's
new shop.

We see this REGISTER with Jorge: a quick flash of resentment.

JORGE
(playing it off)
GINA‘S new shop? That was quick.

He walks the client ever to the wash sink.

JORGE
(continuing; under
his breath)

...didn't waste ANY time...

INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP - LATER

The radio is on. Lola is still working on Rochelle. Ashley is
styling Mrs. Towner while the little girl fidgets in Lynn's
chair. Two YOUNG WOMEN have come in, and they wait on Gina's
couch. Gina spots them, picks up her speed a notch.

RADIO
...that's the thing. Tell me you
don't all have more respect for a
stubborn man, a man with a little
mean to him—

CLOSE ON: Denise's hair as Gina finishes it up. She's styled
it and softened the whole thing.

ASHLEY
That‘s insane. She's confusing
stubbornness with self-respect.

LOLA
But a man who knows hisself is
gonna be hard—headed.

Denise's hair shines, silky, full of body.

ASHLEY
It‘s ignorant. She'ss

GINA
—just a DJ playing music. Okay? I
love her. Woman speaks her mind...

34.

Denise looks in the mirror, stares at herself. Clutches her
bag.

RADIO
I‘ll let you think about that
while I hit you with this jam from
Ludakris.

MUSIC in BACKGROUND.

DENISE
(dramatic whisper)
Gina. Girl. You are amazing.
(shouting)
Rochelle?! ROCHELLE!!!

Rochelle, still getting her nails done, looks at Denise,
double—takes and jumps over.

ROCHELLE
Oh my God. Lookit that hair! Is
that a wig?

DENISE
That‘s MY HAIR!“

ROCHELLE
No! Stop! That's your HAIR!?

Roehelle turns an admiring eye to Gina.

ROCHELLE
(continuing)
Girl. 1 am booking you! When can
I get in?

GINA
Tomorrow? Ten AM?

ROCHELLE
Make it twelve. I‘ll be there.

As Gina sits down, working at lightening speed, The door
swings open and the Catfish Lady, RITA, comes in with ..
cart of food. She's a heavysset sister with DONE hair and
bright clothes. Everyone greets her, shouts their HEYS and
ABOUT TIMES.

RITA
_ (looking around)
What happened heah? Ivanah Trump
move in?

Howls of laughter.

CATFISH LADY
You got Ted Turner investing up in
here? What? He foolin‘ around with
a black girl? Want her to have a
nice place to get her weave?

More laughter. Gina smiles at Rita.

GINA
What're you selling here ~?

Rita takes her hands.

RITA
For you, baby, anything. Look at
you! You're fabulous! You're
breathing life in here! It's
brilliant!

GINA
Thank you. Listen, if you want to
set up food, you can go in the
kitchen—

She's drowned out as the everyone starts shouting out orders:
Lola, Ashley, Denise and Rochelle shout it out, throw their
money down. Rita starts handing out heaping plates of greasy
food. Everyone starts eating and talking at once. Energy is
building, everyone is louder, getting comfortable. Lynn is
the only one who waits. Gina gives her a little nod, a go
ahead, and she gets a plate, keeps it on her lap.

CUT TO:
INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP r EVENING

The place is a mess, everyone is gone. Gina stands alone,
counting her money, looking around. Despite the rocky start,
she's proud, smiling. She turns the music up and starts to
clean...

CUT TO:
INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP s DAY

The next day. The shop is sparkling Clean. Lola and Ashley
are both working while Lynn works the register and phone.
Rita Comes in with her food, and after her, TWO NEW WOMEN
from the neighborhood. Rochelle is now seated at Gina's
chair, getting HER hair done. Denise watches. Everyone grabs
food from Rita, talking over the music on the radio. The song
segues back to the DJ.

36.

RADIO
(female DJ)
I heard something about Ludakris
and Lil' Kim. Now what would their
baby look like?

Rita laughs loudly. The others REACT, too. Gina smiles,

nodding.

Everybody

Everyone

RADIO

(continuing)
I can't stand all this talk about
Lil' Kim being like Pamela
Anderson. C'mon, now. Think about.
She got on wigs of every shape and
size, spike heels, fake eyelashes
for days. She's no Pamela
Anderson...

DENISE
ThaS‘ right. Lil' Kim is my girl!
She's no Malibu Baywatch bunny.

RADIO
(DJ)
She's the next RuPaul!

cracks up.

LOLA
Mami is crazy!

RADIO
Seriously. Lil' Kim ain‘t trying
to be white...she's trying to be
a drag queen.

s reacts, laughing, talking.

DENISE
That Lisa L doesn't play!

ASHLEY
Lil' Kim is a girl from the
ghetto, trying to impress upon
everyone that she can go as far as
she wants now. I don't think it's
a statement about sexuality so
much as it is a statement about
money-

GINA
I think you all are missing her
HUMOR. C'mon. Biggie Smalls
brought her up from Brooklyn and
now she's just being as over done
as she can. Barbie doll styles

37.

Everyone nods, says their piece. Gina is working as fast as
she can, motioning to one of the waiting women to sit in her
chair. She starts on the her, while still finishing Rochelle.

Rita's taken a Chair and talks loudly over the radio to
anyone who'll listen.

RITA
You like the peas? I did ’em up
with some brown sugar and curry
today.”

In the middle of it all, the door swings open and a TEEN AGE
BOY (eighteen, stringﬂbean wiry and hyper) blasts through, a
huge boom box pounding out an old schOOl sounding rap. He
does a spin, nearly falling over from the weight of the boom
box: he lands in front of Gina, a finger pointed at her.

WILLIE
YOU! I've been watching you all
morning! My beautiful African
Goddess, YOU are gonna be in my
new video—

ASIHZEY
Hey, Will.

LOLA
How you doin' Willie?

He turns it UP.

WILLIE
(shouting; to Gina)
You LIKE it? It‘s old school,
Krylon on the walls, Rock Steady
Crew on the block, Sugar Hill gang
up on Clayton Powell Ave—

Gina reaches over and turns the music off—

GINA
You better watch yourself kid,
that thing weighs more than you:
gonna tip yourself over—

WILLIE
You like it? I want you IN it,
Honey Lovel That's the latest
joint trom Funkmaster W—

GINA
Okay, Funkmaster. Why don't you
take your music, go home and ask
your Mama to show you how to talk
to a lady.

(more)

38.

GINA (cont'd)
That WAS your Mama I saw drop you
off at House of Stereo this
morning?

Ashley and Lola crack up. Willie falls to his knees in Frnnt
oI Gina, undeterred. She steps back, surprised. This boy is
persistent.

WILLIE
Wait, wait, wait! Here me out.
That's just my day job. I seen you
and all I could think was, I have
to have her in my VldEOc

GINA
C'mon, Funkmaster.

She starts leading him to the door.

GINA
(continuing)
I got grown—ups to deal with.

WILLIE
Wait! Wait! My Queens

GINA
Queen? I like THAT. That's better—

She keeps pushing him.

WILLIE
Lemme at least hook you up with a
stereo. I can get you a leather
cased, chrome edged system in
these corners, sub—woofers halfe
price—

GINA
Baby, you got the whole Old School
thing going on. I wouldn't want to
take time away from your music and
all. You just go on and work that
flavor.

She pushes him out the door and into the street, cic'ia
door behind her as he keeps rambling on. Just at Gin
shoulder, a softseyed, middle aged woman waits. She has a
sweet smile, motherly grace about her.

 

  

LORRAINE
Gina? Lorraine Bradley.

Gina looks up from her busy work on the new client.

39.

GINA
Lorraine!

She has no idea who Lorraine is.

LORRAINE
We met at your Aunt Paulette's
church? I‘m the work-tohwelfare
counselor.

GINA
Right! Lorraine!

Through the large front glass window, we see Darnelle walking
up, Valerie in tow.

LORRAINE
We had a three—O'clock?

GINA
Of course! Sit down. Let me get
you a robe...

she grabs a robe, slips it on, quickly. She's got her hands
full now.

LORRAINE
I was thinking...maybe we could
just do new braids—

The young woman (new client} taps her fingers, jiggles her
water glass.

GINA
Beautiful. Braids.

Darnelle steps in with Valerie who runs up and squeezes her.
Darnelle grabs Gina‘s arm.

DARNELLE
I got to talk to you~

GINA
Not now, Darnelle~

LORRAINE
Maybe shorter braids.

GINA
Sure, sure. Rochelle? I'Ll be
right there—

Valerie tosses her back pack in a corner.

VALERIE
Guess what I played today? All the
way through?

40.

DARNELLE
Gina-

GINA
(to Darnelle)
Not right now!

DARNELLE
But it's important—

GINA
(to Lorraine)
I'm just gonna finish up here. Can
I get you a Cappuccino?

LORRAINE
That would be lovely!

ROCHELLE
I'll take one theses

VALERIE
Beethoven's fifth!

GINA
That's GREAT, baby! I'll be right
back!

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN _ CONTINUING

Darnelle follows Gina into the kitchen while Gina slams down
cups, pours out milk.

On the walls of the kitchen, Gina has tacked up family
pictures: Valerie and Gina: Gina, Valerie and her husband,
RED. A picture of RED, black and white, with the inscription
ALWAYS THERE engraved on the frame. Gina shakes her head.

GINA
Damn! I need to staff up this
place! I only got five clients in
here and we got our hands full!
Help me with this, Darnelle—

DARNELLE
The bike's gone. PJ's bike.

GINA
Where'd you leave it?

She hits the Cappuccino machine button. Nothing.

DARNELLE
On the street. In front of
Leeanne‘s—

Gina crOuches down and fiddles with the outlet.

GINA
What you want me to do?

DARNELLE
It might have got towed. If I file
a stolen vehicle report, and it
was towed, I’ll have to get its

Gina straightens up.

GINA
This has GOT to wait.

DARNELLE
I just need you to float me some
cash“

GINA

Thought you were gettin‘ "taken
care of"—

She hits the ON button on the Cappuccino machine. Suddenly,
there's a loud POP.

CLOSE ON: the faulty outlet, it sparks and smokes. The
ceiling lights flicker.

Gina freezes, then swings open the kitchen door and runs into
the middle of the shop just in time to see-

GINA'S P.O.V.: The dryers short out, One by one: PFFEFT,
PFFFT, PFFFT, REFET... down the line until the last one is
dead.

The lights flicker and then GO OUT. It's suddenly silent AND
dark. No radio, no lights...no power.

ANGLE ON: Gina, trying not to panic.

VALERIE (0.8.)
Mama?

GINA
It's cool, it's cool. We got this
handled! NOBODY MOVE!

We hear the NOISE of chaos in the dark: a CRASH, someone
trips, a glass breaks ..then cursing.

EXT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP " DAY

Gina steps outside, looks up and down the block, not sure
what to do. One of the BARBERS from the shop down the block
sticks his head out, shouts to Gina:

BARBER
Inspector's coming down the way in
a bit—

Gina curses under her breath, looks across the street, spots
Willie in the middle of a sale at House of Stereo. She puts
two fingers in her mouth and whistles...LOUD. Willie jumps.
Gina points to him. He puts a hand over his heart, eyes wide:
ME? Gina gives him a slow sexy nod, mouths: YOU.

INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP — DAY

Willie is on his hands and knees; Gina watches_as he hooks up
a generator from the stereo shop. A candle is lit.

WILLIE
I'm not supposed to take this out
the shops

GINA

I'll make it up to you.

WILLIE
Be in my video?

GINA
We'll see.

Gina hears movement, rustling. Turns around and spots Ashley
and Lola packing it in for the day.

GINA
(continuing)
Wait, WAIT! Hold up everybody! I
didn't say we were closing down!

ASHLEY
We can't do hair without
electricity.

GINA
Just gimme a minute.

Lola ignores Gina and steps towards the door, swinging her
bag over her shoulder. Valerie looks up at her Mother: what‘s
she gonna do?

Gina's eyes narrow. She gets in front of Lola, who's startled
by her sudden presence, blocking her exit.

43.

GINA
(continuing)
You know something? I think we
started off on the wrong foot.
Let's try this again. Hi. My name
is Gina. This is MY shep. I AM
running things up in here.

LOLA
We can‘t work like this—

GINA
NOBODY is leaving until every
client in here is DONE and looking
fly—

LOLA
ewithout no juices

GINA
ewe'll be braiding and polishing
with a dang tlashlight if we have
to, understand?

At that moment, the generator sparks, whirs, and all the
lights flicker on.

GINA
(continuing)
What d'you know.

As Lola slams her bag down and huffs back to her station, we
catch Denise, standing on tOp of one of the counters in a
Karate pose. Rochelle is behind her, holding up a nail File.

WILLIE
000! These girls is gettin'
READY—

They quickly take their seats, trying to play it off.

ROCHELLE
Thought we were gonna have to
throw down—

DENISE
~for some terrorism action.

ROCHELLE
She knows aila that Tae Kwan Do
shite

44.

WILLIE
(to Denise and
Rochelle)
That's some "Kill Bill" feeling,
right there! I could use you both
in ma video.

Gina puts an arm around him.

GINA
Don't you have some stereos to
sell?

Starts walking him out.

WILLIE
I was thinkin‘ a little girl—on—
girl action. Maybe you and one of
themr

GINA
MmmsHmm. Okay. I feel you. I dos

She closes the door after him. We can see him continue to
yell from outside as Gina turns her attention back to the
shop. Darnelle is still hovering, still in need.

DARNELLE
Gina—

GINA
(annoyed)
Go get my purse. Take out seventy—
five bucks. Should be enough to
get the bike out from the tow shop.

Darnelle hugs her.

DARNELLE
Thanks, cuz.

She turns to go and Gina stops her.

GINA
I‘m not banked—up like I was at
Jorge's, Darnelle. That was my

Darnelle nods, holds her hands up to Gina, gratetul. As
Darnelle spins around out the door, she nearly runs smack
into the Health Department INSPECTOR, a terse, no nonsense
man in his fifties.

There's silence as he looks around, makes some notes. Gina
approaches with a big smile.

GINA
(continuing)
Hi, how you doing? I'm Gina and I
just bought the shop—

INSPECTOR
This generator is not up to code.
It's a violation.

He starts checking everyone‘s licenses, examining each

Wait, wait. The Salvation Army is

He writes something down an rips off a ticket for her.

GINA

The dryers will be fixed tomorrow.

He hands her the ticket and she reads it, incredulous.

Five hundred dollars?

LYNN
You‘ll be okay. Just need to get

GINA

We catch Lola with a smug look.

LOLA

Gina looks down: Valerie, doing her homework in a corner,
all ears and eyes. Gina smiles.

GINA
Oh, we're doing just FINE.

Outside we see a Salvation Army truck pull up.

GINA
(continuing)
Great.
(to truck)
Your timing SUCKS.

The door opens and the truck driver steps OUT. JAMES is a
wellrbuilt, gorgeous young man. We can see his six pack

through his tank top. There's something meticulous and well

groomed about him. His hair is braided in neat corn~rows.

James pulls out a clipboard.

GINA

Gina smiles.

GINA
Okay. 807

JAMES

—illegal sale of restricted
narcotics—

Gina laughs, she's got him there. She looks at James, notices
how all the women are staring at him. The hairdressers are
listening in. A couple of young WOMEN on the street have
stopped to look at James through the front window. Gina makes
a mental note of it.

GINA
Nice braids.

JAMES
Do 'em myself.

GINA
Fo' real?

JAMES
Yeah. I was the guy on the block
who did all the homeboy's braids.

GINA
And you're not talking 'block' as
in "Jenny from the Block."

He laughs.

JAMES
There's always one.

She gives him a big, sexy smile.

GINA
Like yo‘ job driving the truck?

He looks at her.

JAMES
Better than doing time.

GINA
Mmmerm. You sound like your ready

lNT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP * DAY

James is standing at the chair in the window, Gina at his
shoulder. He's braiding one of the young women who‘d been
looking in. He‘s good and QUICK. She's in heaven.

At the back of the shop, Lola, Ashley and Lynn watch. Valerie
hovers, fascinated, listening to the women talk.

LOLA
Uh—uh. That ain't right, a man
looking that good.

ASHLEY
You think he's all man? He WAS the
jailhouse braider.

LOLA
You think it's like THAT?

VALERIE
Like what? Like WHAT?

ASHLEY
Something about him...he‘s almost
TOO good—looking.

LYNN
(to Valerie)
Like he got some swish down river.

Valerie looks baffled. Lola sucks in her gut, pushes her
boobs to the TOP of her halter.

LOLA
Only one way to find out if Papi
is buyin' what we're sellin'e

She steps over to James.

LOLA
(continuing)
I like that, papi. You're good
with your hands.

James looks at her admiringly, but it's unclear just How.

JAMES
(friendly, but not
too flirty)

Yeah? Thanks.

He looks at Gina, grins. Gina nearly [ails over trom his
smile. When she looks up, three WOMEN have walked in off the
street to watch James.

49.

GINA
Can I help you?

WOMAN #1
He braiding hair?

WOMAN #l

(continuing)
I DO need my braids redone.

GINA
All right. Come on over here.

As she sits her down, we see two other WOMEN who are waiting
for James's services.

GINA

And by the way, you‘re hired.

Gina is still working on Lorraine.

PAULETTE

Gina and Valerie exchange a quick glance.

GINA
Yeah, for a minute.

PAULETTE
Don't be lending her any money,
Gina.

VALERIE

She don't have any to lend.

GINA
l'm getting tapped out.

Lorraine, who's braids she's doing looks up.

LORRAlNE
You'll make money. You hang in
here. Trust me. I work with women
and men who go from welfare to
having SUCcesstul businesses.

GINA
Really?

50.

LORRAINE
It's all in your attitude. You got
to be prepared to take losses in
the beginning. Keep your
perspective, okay? You have your
OWN shop. That's a victory. That's
success right there.

GINA
I'm looking at much more than this.

She winks at Lorraine.

GINA
(continuing)
You wait. I got PLANS...

CUT TO:
INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP — NIGHT

The shop is closed. Gina is sitting at her desk, looking at
eyeslevel at a row of high—end beauty products. She examines
the bottles carefully, looks at the labels. In front of her
she has a row of empty bottles, unique, interesting shapes
and sizes. She examines them, makes some notes. Valerie is
sitting at her feet, doing homework.

Outside, a truck pulls up: the side reads, JOE RAINEY,
ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR.

GINA
Finally.

JOE RAINEY (30's, good—looking} walks in, loaded down with
gear.

JOE
Hey. YOU'RE Gina?

He looks surprised.
GINA

Mmm Hmm. That's me.
(off his look)

What?

JOE
I didn't expect...l mean, the
other lady here was...very
different.

Gina smiles, can't help but check him out. This one is FINE
in a hardeorking, rough, real—man kinda way.

51.

JOE
(continuing)
Is there a MISTER Gina—?

GINA
Morris. No. Not anymore.

Valerie, looks up, watches her mother carefully.

JOE
(checking her out)
I woulda been here sooner had 1
known—

She laughs, then notices Valerie. Becomes business~like.

GINA
Like I said on the phone,
everything blew out this afternoon.

He nods.

JOE
Fuse box?

GINA
in the basement.

He disappears for a beat and Gina takes a quick glance in the
mirror. She smooths her hair down, throws on some lip gloss.
Valerie watches, a question forming—

GINA
(continuing)
Valerie. Quit! Okay?

VALERIE
Are you attracted to HIM?

GINA
(warning)
He's helping us. Go on. You got
homework.

She shoos her into the kitchen just as Joe comes back up the
stairs, steps to her.

JOE
You got problems.

GINA
Hope you can fix 'em...

JOE
I think I can.

GINA
ReaIJy?

She leans closer as he starts sketching something on a pea.

JOE
(while he's drawing)
You need to re—wire alot of these
conduit boxes. I'm gonna get some
cable and start laying some lines
so you can have power tomorrow.

GINA
(getting worried)
Okay.
JOE
When‘d you take over here?
GINA
It‘s my first week.
JOE
Man. You gonna brighten this spot

up.
Valerie steps out of the kitchen and right up to Joe.

VALERIE
Just in case you were thinking
about it, my Mama is not ready to
start dating—

GINA
Valerie! Get back in THERE! This
is NOT a three—way conversation.

She pushes Valerie into the kitchen.

JOE
How old is she?

GINA
Nine. Going on forty.

JOE
Don't know what man would ever
want to leave you and that pretty
little girl.

GINA
Didn't have much choice. My
husband died two years ago.

Joe feels bad. The sexy, flirt has just flown out of the
room. But he's not fazed or thrown off.

JOE

Oh man. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
GINA

Yeah. It's been...hard. Raising

our kid, being the one to bring it
on home .

JOE
You seem like you can handle alot.
Some women have that, a special
something, like they can survive
things a man never could.

She looks at him thoughtfully.

JOE
(continuing)
Seriously. Brother would just
crawl up in the bed and pray for
someone to come along and fix it
all up for him.

Gina smiles.
GINA
Not YOU. I don't get that from

you.

Valerie pokes her head in.

VALERIE
MAMA? We got to go practice. I'm
waiting.

GINA

. (under her breath)
And I'm TALKING.

She straightens up, takes a step back from Joe.

GINA
(continuing; looking
away)
Look. I need this done. But I
can‘t pay you right new...

JOE
We can set something up. Put you
on a payment schedule. That way,
I know I'll see you at least once
a month.

Gina tries to hide her smile. He taps the dryers.

JOE
(continuing)
These are shot. You gonna have to
get new ones.

He *ees the look of terror and panic come over Gina's tare.

GINA
No, no, no. Don't tell me that.

He writes a number down for her.

JOE
I know this equipment supply
service where you could probably
rent them for some kinda monthly
fee. Shouldn't be too much.

Gina looks at him. She's moved by his genuine helpfulness.

GINA
Thanks, thank you. I really
appreciate... everything.

He smiles. There‘s an awkward beat as he pauses, clearly
wanting to say more, maybe even ask her out. He glances back
at Valerie, smiles at herr

JOE
Take care of yo' Mama, now.
Valerie just glares in his direction as the door shuts behind
him.

At that moment, Terri walks in, head to toe Donna Karan.
Everyone stops what they‘re doing...freezes.

LOLA

Friend of yours?

ASHLEY
Uh—Uh.

It takes Gina a minute to look up From Rochelle‘s hair and
spot her.

GINA
Terri!?

Terri stands at the entranceway, flustered, not used to the
vibe. Gina gets up, leads her in.

GINA
(continuing)
Terri? I didn't think I'd see you
in these parts...

ierri sees her and throws her arms around her.

TERRI
I MISSED you, Gina. I had to track
you down!

Everyone looks on, surprise as Gina returns the hug, touches
Terri's hair with warmth and familiarity. Gina ushers her to
a chair, takes her coat and helps her into a robe. She hands
her a bottle of Evian.

GINA
You‘re due, Terri.

She nods, smiling.

George gets back.

GINA
He's away again?

TERRI
Yes. Five days in Hawaii. Maui.

Rochelle perks up, listening.

ROCHELLE
What‘s he do? Your man.

Terri looks at her: realizes she's being talked to.

TERRI
My husband? He's a sports lawyer.

DENISE
In Hawaii?

TERRI
They go there to work on deals and

Denise and Rochelle exchange a LOOK. Lola raises her eyebrows.

When was the last time he hit it?

TERRI
'Hit it?’ What do you mean?

Lynn rocks her hips a little, in and out.

TERRI

Oh my God! THAT. No, no. It's
nothing like that. It's just work.
He works really hard—

A beat.

ROCHELLE
She's got a point.

TERRI
Maybe he's just making a conscious
decision, you know, not to
overcrowd the planet...

DENISE
1 don't think so. I don‘t get
‘Tree Hugger' from Lennox Lewis.

At that moment Rita the Catfish Lady comes in and sets her
cart up. Everyone starts hollering out their orders ihm
walks down the line of Chairs, laying down paper plates laden

with the greasy food. She stops at Terri.

CATFISH LADY
You hungry?

TERRI

She's starving.

TERRI
(continuing)
—not really hungry. I mean, I
don‘t really eat meat.

CATFISH LADY
I got some okra, some greens...
TERRT

that?

Darnelle laughs out loud. Catfish Lady stares at her.

TERRI
(continuing)
1 mean, if you were going to Lake
a guess at, say, how many grams of
Fat are in —

CATFISH LADY
Honey, these greens is just a
flavor for the fat.

She puts a plate in front of Terri, with a Side of yams and
butter thick cornbread. Terri is too intimidated to refuse.

Everybody waits, WATCHES as Terri slowly, slowly takes a
bite. The whole rOOm is quiet, staring as she eats.

TERRI
(surprised)
lt's.._it's GOOD.

She chews, the flavor slowly growing on her.
GINA

Better than that rabbit food you
had every day-

TERRI
I want to get down to a size

DENISE

Why is it a white girl thinks she
looks good all dried up?

TERRI
l‘m not sixteen. I mean, at
sixteen, l didn't mind having, you
know, a figure.

ROCHELLE
But how come you see sixteen year
old white girls tryin' to be all
skinny?

Terri is nodding, leans back and motions for Rita to bLlHJ
her MORE food. Her plate gets loaded down and she eats with

relish.

TERRI
That's sad. Really.
ASHLEY

boarding school.

Rochelle nearly chokes on her food.

Terri laughs at the thought. Suddenly, Jay Z's "A Dream"
comes on and Lola turns it up. She stands up, starts shaking
it to the music.

GINA
(continuing; to Terri)
Now THAT—
(pointing to Lola's
ass)
—is why you want to keep eating.

Lola dances, goes right up behind James. All the girls start
howling. He grabs her, starts dancing up close. Gina *

Darnelle groans.

GINA
I am doing you a favor, Miss Thug

Paulette crosses her arms, enjoying this.

DARNELLE
I can‘t do hair.

GINA
You can do color.

Gina touches Darnelle's multi—hued hair.

GINA
(continuing)
Girl, I KNOW you can do color.
You're a different shade every

Darnelle grabs her purse, furious.

GINA

It‘s that, or I bring you back

Gina is pouring out her Special Sauce into a few of the ranty

in, with Terri at her side. Everyone stops and stares. Miss
Thing is a sight: head to toe Gucci and Dolce Gabanna, hi“
tech shades, a Louis Vuitton bag. She is Paris Hilton with a
dash of Pamela Anderson. Nothing but shocking. Terri looks
downright conservative and ordinary next to her. Joanne sees
Gina and holds her arms out. Gina, surprised, thrilled, opens
her arms.

GINA
Joanne! Lookit you!

JOANNE
Everybody is.

TERRI
I had such a great time here the

Such an organic... experience. I

Gina smiles at Terri, touches Joanne's hair.

Terri goes over to Lola to get her nails done. Joanne lowers
her glasses as she spots James.

JOANNE

GINA
That he does.

Lola peers over at Joanne‘s hands, sees the gorgeous Louis

LOLA
Cute.

GINA

Joanne is the Louis Vuitton rep at

Oh. She‘s a salesgirl. Don't look

work done, why not?

She looks right at James.

JOANNE
(continuing)
What about you? Don't you think a
woman's beauty can be enhanced
with a little...work?

She crosses her legs. Uncrosses them. James looks at her
ample chest. Lola, doing a pedicure right next to him,
catches it all.

LOLA
Lookit this one making a play.

It depends on how it looks at the

Lola coughs, pretends she's choking.

LOLA
I guess some people got to spend

Seeing that these two are NOT getting along, Gina gets Lola

up, pushes her towards the kitchen.

GINA
Lola, whyn't you go take a break*

Joanne steps over to James, watches him braid a client, while

her own hair steeps in the special sauce.

JOANNE
I'm liking that. You are good! Do
you give back rubs?

At that moment the door swings open and the health INSPECTOR
marches in with his notebook. Darnelle, Who's doing hielites
on an older WOMAN, turns her back, tries vainly to disappear.
Everyone watches as he goes through the shop, Gina at his
heels.

Gina smiles, but shoots Darnelle a LOOK.

I KNOW she's not letting HER in
here.

LOLA

I'd make HER shower up before I
touched her.

Dee hesitates at the door, Gina smiles, motions for her
step in. Ashley holds her hands up, shakes her head. Lynn
busy. Darnelle shakes her head at Gina, mouths NO WAY.

 

GINA
(whispered; to girls}
What is wrong with all of you? You
never had a bad day? I hope you
all never fall on hard times, the
way you act.

She grabs Dee and sits her down, gives her a robe and a water.

GINA
(Continuing; to Dee)
Soon as I‘m done washing you,
Darnelle here is gonna hook you up
with some color.

Darnelle's eyes WIDEN. Gina gives her a LOOK.

GINA

I‘m gonna give you a little
Special Sauce here, fix your hair

Gina holds up a bottle. She's glued on a clever,
label: GINA'S SPECIAL SAUCE.

GINA

JOANNE
Something big.

GINA
That‘s the idea.

Joanne smiles, game. Leans over to pick up her bag.. thinks
twice.

JOANNE
James? Do you mind getting that

Lynn and Gina exchange smiles. THIS One has got game. Lola
glares at her.

JAMES
No problem.

Joanne turns, following James out to her car, pulls out a
twenty and drops it on Lola's lap.

JOANNE
You look like you could use a
little...help.

Lola gets up, fists clenched, and tries to go after her. Gina
holds her back.

GlNA
Settle yourself, girl.

LOLA
You watch. I'm gonna beat her down!

GINA
In whose shop? Talking about
you're gonna “beat her down." Not

HERE. Not in MY shop.

Lola tears herself away from Gina, cursing in Spanish and
settles down.

ANGLE ON: Joanne getting in her car. As she gets in and James
hands her her bag, she slips him her number.

JOANNE
Call me. Mr. Marcus is away alot
of the time.

James smiles, tucks the number in his shirt, but doesn't make
it clear one way or the other how he feels.

GINA

Lynn)
THAT is gonna be some crazy
drama, those two hook—up.

LYNN

Gina watches as Darnelle stands her up, turns her to the
mirror. Her hair is DONE, gorgeous with new coppery hi-
lights. Despite herself, Darnelle is smiling, touching the

l

hair, looking at how it catches the light: proud of her wort.
Dee is grinning. She looks amazing, transformed.

GINA
(whispered: to
Darnelle)
Feels good, don't it?

Darnelle looks at her cousin. Nods. It's a moment. Unspoken,
subtle ..there's been a shift in Darnelle's attitude.

He ducks out.

DARNELLE
O—KAY! I see how it is!

GINA
Now don't go THERE yet.

DARNELLE
Mmm—Hmm.

When Gina looks up, it's just in time to see Joe wheeling in
a small, upright piano. Gina's mouth drops open.

VALERIE

Joe leans down, getting eye—level with Valerie.

JOE
Tell you what. You look like a

out that I'm a nice guy.

Valerie looks at Joe, looks at the piano, softening.

Lola looks away, feels horrible.

INT. GINA‘S BEAUTY SHOP e AFTERNOON

Gina is pacing while hair gets done. Lorraine is there. Jamxn
is braiding. Denise and Rochelle are in. Darnelle, Ashley and
Lynn are both busy but they stop everything the second the
door opens and Terri sweeps in, pulling off her scarf and
coat. She pulls a flyer out from her purse. Everyone gathers
around.

  

93.

TERRI
I got it. There‘s a whole display
of these up at the Neiman's beauty
counters—

CLOSE ON: the Ilyer. It's a beautifully art directed shot of
a jar of JORGE'S SPECIAL SAUCE. A gorgeous MODEL holds the
JAR, and above her in large print it reads:

GINA
(reading)
"...Jorge's Special Sauce:
premiering on sale at the Atlanta
Hair Convention."

ASHLEY
The hair shows! That's next
weekends

Gina looks at the flyer for a beat. She sits back, crushed.
No one's ever seen her like this, so thoroughly detlated.

LORRAlNE
You got the shop, Gina. You got
your business—

GINA
I been counting on THIS.

LORRAINE
You're smart. You‘ll figure it out.

Gina looks at the picture of the jar.

GINA
He did a nice job.

A beat. She taps the flyer. Holds it up.

GINA
(continuing)
That's my dream, right there.

James steps forward.

JAMES
Gina. We can go over there. Step
up to him. We can break him down—

GINA
No, no. Thanks but, no. I‘m not
stooping to his bullshit; I'll
figure out something else—

At that moment, the door opens and Lola walks in. There's a
deathly silence as everyone stares at her: they ALL know.
James shakes his head, disgusLed.

94.

Lola takes a deep breath, looks at Gina. It's taken alot of
balls for her to come back in here.

LOLA
Gina, I know I REALLY messed up,
but.. you have to let me make it

up to you.
The whole shop is madedogging her, listening.

LOLA
(continuing)
No one's ever...RESPECTED me like
you do...nobody‘s ever put up with
my shit, and stood up for me.'

Lynn starts to come forward, like she‘s gonna throw Lola out.
Gina stops her.

LOLA
(continuing)
I'll do anything. I'll work for
free. I'll sell my ear—

Gina stares at her. Points to the jar.

GINA
(quietly)
That's generations of knowledge in
there. That's priceless! You
understand? Nothing that special's
ever gonna come my way again.

Lola looks away. A beat. Gina grabs an apron, throws it at
Lola.

GINA
(continuing)
Get to work—

LOLA
Thank you, thank you! I won't let
you down—

GINA
I'm not doing this for YOU, Lola.

A beat as Gina stares at her.

GINA

I give people second chances
'cause I hate stayin' mad. Uh—uh.
I'm not doing that to MYSELF.

Everyone behind her does the same: the whole shop hr

DARNELLE

GINA
(slowly)

Not just robbed—

LOLA
Run out.

GINA
That's right. That's exactly right.

They move through, crunching through broken glass as they
look around.

Paulette arrives, Valerie in tow. Valerie gasps, bursts into
tears. Paulette is open—mouthed, horrified. Gina grabs
Valerie, picks her up and hugs her.

PAULETTE
Oh my Lord! Jesusl Who'd do this?

GINA
(knowingly)
Who'd want to see me put out.

It's not a question. Gina turns and looks at Lola. They know.
They ALL do. Nothing more needs to be saide

INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP r LATER

A squad car is out front. Two DETECTIVES (white, 30's) are
talking to Gina, while James, Lynn, Lola and Darnelle start
cleaning up the mess.

DET. #1
(taking notes)
..what missing valuables?

GINA
Cash, beauty supplies,
eguipment...everything.

The two detectives exchange a look.

GINA
(continuing)
I have my suspicions —

DET. #1
You got drug debts?

GINA
Drug debts? No!

DET. #1
‘Cause otherwise, this fits right
in with a series of neighborhood
robberies-

DET. #1

Tell us what you know, we‘ll run
it, see if anything comes up.

GINA
Seems like you've got your minds
already made up.

Gina sighs, defeated, worn out.

GINA
(continuing)
I got to get home, get Valerie
ready for her recital tonight and
I don't even have LAST quarter‘s
tuition.

Lynn steps over.

LYNN
Lemme help clean this. We can get

GINA
I'm DONE. I don‘t have it in me to
keep going. I don't have the
resources.

OFF GINA, devastated, we—
CUT TO:
INT. GINA‘S HOUSE - CASCADE ROW, "SWATS"

Aunt Paulette and Darnelle wait while Gina puts finishing
touches on Valerie‘s hair. Everyone is dressed in their
Sunday best. Valerie's hair is a cascade of flowing waves,
topped off with a small, golden musical notes Clipped into
the fall. Paulette and Darnelle try to compensate for Gina's
somber mood.

PAULETTE
Baby, you look gorgeous!
VALERIE
Really?
DARNELLE

Oh yeah! Over the top gorgeous.

VALERIE
It's not too Beyonce?

PAULETTE
NO, no.

Valerie catches her mother's quiet gaze.

VALERIE
Are the cops gonna tind whoever
did it?

PAULETTE

(to Darnelle)
Wasn‘t one of YOUR friends?

DARNELLE
Yeah, right. Thanks, Mama.

VALERIE

You think it was Jorge?

GINA
I KNOW it was Jorge. But you got
to let the law take it's course.
Innocent until proven guilty.
Isn't that how it goes?

Gina sighs.

GINA
(continuing)
I told them to check into it...
we'll see.

Aunt Paulette leans down to Valerie.

PAULETTE
(to Valerie)
How about, after your recital, we
go get you a Sundae at thirty—one
flavors?

Valerie's face lights up.

VALERIE
Yeah!

She looks at her Mom, desperate to see her happy.
VALERIE

(continuing)
What do you think, Mom?

Gina forces a smile.

GINA
Sounds good, baby. You're the star.

99.

She gives her a big squeeze. They all get up, Gina helps
Valerie into her coat. Paulette hangs back, motions for
Darnelle to lead Valerie to the car.

PAULﬁ'l‘TE

You gonna tell her?

Gina looks at her Aunt.

GINA
Not tonight. I want her to enjoy
this moment. Let her shine. They

Paulette nods.

PAULETTE
You gonna have to tell her.

GINA
What do I say? Baby, I let you

PAULETTE
You'll find the right way“

INT. MUSIC AND ART SCHOOL n EVENING

A huge auditorium. A panel of esteemed MUSIC TEACHERS are
seated at a long table. Parean (mostly white and Asian} and
coaches fill some of the seats. A young ASIAN BOY is playing
the violin as Gina, Darnelle and Paulette take seats up
front. The boy finishes playing and everyone applauds.

TEACHER
Next we have—
(reading)
Valerie Morris.

There's a beat...and then Valerie walks across the stage to
the grand piano that‘s set up there. She pauses...and then
begins to play.

We can see Gina become visibly moved by the first few subtle
notes. She sits up, looks around at all the faces of-everyone
listening and she knows: it's pure magic. Her face is fil‘ci
with emotion, with a sense of pride and...impending loss.

EXT. MUSIC AND ART SCHOOL 7 NIGHT

As Gina and Valerie are leaving, a TEACHER runs up to them:
she‘s young, vibrant.

TEACHER
Mrs. Morris? So FANTASTIC to meet
you!
The teacher pumps Gina's hand, then Gives Valerie a big hug.

You did great!

Valerie is beaming. Gina smiles, trying not to let her
heartbreak show.

As Gina opens the door, she reaches dewn to picks up some
mail that's been shoved through the slot, doesn't look up to:
a beat. When She does, she double—takes; GASPS. The shOp ha:
been completely transformed. Lynn, James, Darnelle, Ashley
and Lola stand by proudly as Gina takes it in: everyone has
brought in their own furniture and equipment. The mirrors
have been replaced by funky, mismatched ballroom mirrors. The
coffee tables have been replaced. There are couches, rugs,
lamps and wall hangings. It's crazy and eclectic, but somehow
it works. The only thing that remains are the rental hair
dryers. Gina looks around, overwhelmed.

GINA
What...what Lhe—?

Lake their seats.

DENISE

The door swings open and Terri walks in, sits down at Gina‘s

TERRI

GINA
Something like that—

Terri looks at her, carefully.

TERRI
I want you to do something

Gina stares at her.

GINA

admiring her new, sexy look when two local GHETTO GIRLS walk
in, babies in tow. ONE of them steps forward.

GINA
What can I do for you, gorgeous?

GIRL
I need my weave re—done, but I

GINA
How much you got?

GIRL

GINA
Sit down. Put yo‘ feet up, little
Mama. How old are you?

GIRL
Seventeen...

As Gina starts working on the girl, chatting her up, her baby
wanders, toddling around. The girls pick him up, coo and
tickle him. He giggles and laughs. The other GIRL hugs Lola
and they start to chat: old friends.

LYNN
(aside, to Gina)
So? What's the plan, woman?

GINA
(smiling)
I got a mortgage due, I owe on the
rentals, I'm overdue on Valerie's
tuition... and there are but four
people in here.

LYNN
You're smiling.

GINA
Damn straight, I‘m smiling. I LOVE
this!

She starts laughing.

GINA
(continuing)
One day at a frickin' time. That‘s
how I'm feeling it. I'm open right
now, this minute...until someone
says otherwise!

Lynn starts laughing, holds a hand up.

GINA
(continuing; hitting
it)
That's my damn state—of—the—art
Business Plan!

At that moment, a statuesque WOMAN (African American,
thirties) walks in. She seems local, but with a little more
sophistication. Gina sits her down at her chair.

GINA
(continuing)
You from around here?

WOMAN
My cousin lives around the corner.
She told me you all could do me
right.

Gina looks at her carefully: something about her seems
familiar. Gina starts to slather on some of her Special Sauce.

GINA
You've got a great full face. You
could carry off something with a
little more height-

WOMAN
Reallys?

GINA
Let me try somethings

At that moment, Rita comes in with her cart of food.

RITA
Praise Jesus! If it isn‘t my
favorite hair doctor! Miz Gina!
You gone and redecorated! I like

Gina grins as everyone starts shouting out their orders and
eating Rita's food. The ghetto girls, the woman Gina‘s
working on...cveryone starts talking and commenting on how
good the food is as they eat.

Lynn looks at the bill, nods her approval.

GINA

Never got tipped like THAT at

GINA
Yeah. They went 'round to Jorge's

out for the night I was robbed.

LYNN
I bet he did.

GINA
Right? Fuck him and his alibi and
his Jorge Sauce. I'm right where
I want to be.

Lynn looks at her, surprised to hear her say this.

Jorge becomes indignant.

Gina leans forward, menacing, but keeping her cool.

GINA
Abuse you? You been around too
many old white ladies if you think
THIS is abuse. Just knOW, Jorge,
it's gonna come around. I don't
know how, but you fucked with the

Darnelle shakes her head.

At that moment, the Inspector steps in. He looks around,

Gina follows him, pissed. He starts to write up a ticket when
Darnelle reaches in her bag and pulls out a framed
certificate, hangs it up by her station.

She looks away, a little embarrassed, but playing it off with
major attitude. She is NOT one to apologize.

Yeah. Everybody's here.

Gina looks at her...wants to say something, but decides to

Joanne arranges herself, posing, aware of the hip crowd. At

the line of waiting customers and sits down in front of
Ashley. She pops her teeth out and sets them in a glass.
Ashley looks at Gina. Gina nods, go ahead, do her.

Denise picks up the radio, tearing it out of the wall, and

Joanne backs up, looks over at Terri, whose getting her nails

Ashley, Lynn, Darnelle and Lola are cracking up as Joanne

Gina, meanwhile, has managed to get everyone calmed down as
she plugs the radio back in. Denise and Rochelle are going
off, talking shit, venting to a group of women who've
gathered around them. Terri has stepped over to put a
comforting arm around Denise.

But Paulette walks past Gina and goes over to Darnelle's
chair. Darnelle looks at her, surprised. Gina stares, catches
the moment.

PAULETTE

Okay, daughter. Let‘s see what you

Darnelle looks her in the eye: it's a real moment of
reconciliation, of trust. Darnelle swallows nervously, and
starts on her mother's hair, as the music on the radio segues
back to Lisa L.

RADIO
(DJ)
...don't forget, this weekend, we
got the Atlanta Hair Shows. You
wanna see the best stylists, the
best products, crazy hair...get
tickets—

ANGLE ON: Gina, who catches Lynn's eye. Darnelle looks up.
Ashley stops what she's doing and looks at Gina. James looks
up, too...everyone is smiling, thinking the same thing: an
unspoken decision is made.

INT. GINA'S BEAUTY SHOP — LATER

CLOSE ON: Aunt Paulette, admiring her new hair. We PULL BACK
to reveal Gina‘s crew, each girl (and James) doing each
other‘s hair, set up in a row like a congasline. The shop is
closed. Everyone is talking over everyone else, giving each
other feed-back and direction when Valerie walks in, her
backpack from school over her shoulder. Her mouth gapes open
in surprise.

VALERIE
Mama? What is going on?!

GINA
Hey, baby! We're going to a show.

SMASH CUT:
INT. ATLANTA CONVENTION CENTER

We PAN ACROSS the room. Booths are set up from all the high—
end, upscale shops. Lighting is individual, dramatic. Men and
women crowd around the booths, getting their hair done,
trying new products.

CLOSE ON: Jorge, his hair SHORN prison style. He lords it
over a large JORGE CRISTOPHE display featuring the Special
Sauce. The inspector hovers, checking each booth.

Suddenly, heads are turning, there‘s a murmur in the crowd...

The large double doors of the main ballroom swing open,
revealing six striking FIGURES, backlit, their hair towering
creations. They walk forward in SLO MO and into the light.
It‘s Gina, Darnelle, Lynn, Ashley, Lola and James. They stop,
let the whole damn place take them in. The hair is
outrageous, insane: it‘s art. The crowd goes wild, talking
and pointing...

CUT TO:
INT. CONVENTION CENTER 7 LATER

There's a crowd around the "Gina‘s" booth. Willie is
projecting a back—drop of cool, dissolving digital images of
women on the street, posing with their 'done' hair outside or
Gina's. Rita is passing out food. There's a line for Gina,
who's set up a chair. Lynn and Darnelle are working hair,
while Ashley and James take down names for appointments.
Paulette and Valerie help make change.

Directly across the floor is Jorge's booth, significantly
less crowded.

ANGLE ON: Ashley, as she looks up, spotting someone, and
waves. Gina follows her gaze as a gorgeous, dark—skinned
BEAUTY approaches.

ll6.

Ashley takes the beauty's hand, excited...and then plants a
big kiss on her mouth. Gina stares, surprised but not letting
on.

ASHLEY
(to Gina)
Gina? This is Roxanne, my
girlfriend.

Gina gives her a big hug.

ROXANNE
I‘ve heard so much about you! You
are one special lady.

Gina smiles.

GINA
(to Roxanne)
Well, Ashley here is family.
(to Ashley)
She's gorgeous! You've GOT to let
me do her hair.

Roxanne nods, takes a seat while Ashley holds her hand. They
are still talking when Joe appears. Sits down across from
Gina. She pretends not to notice. Joe is grinning.

ASHLEY
Got to give him credit for
perseverance.

Gina finally looks up at Joe, with a smile.

GINA
And what can I do for you?

JOE
I was thinking, maybe you could do
me some braids.

GINA
Could do that—

JOE
And I'll pay you with dinner and
a movie.

Gina laughs.
GINA
You can pay me with CASH. And I‘ll

think about dinner and a movie—

They look at each other, grinning, all things suddenly
possible.

117.

They're gaze is broken by a sudden commotion at the front
doors: making their way through the crowd are the two
detectives, followed by three armed OFFICERS. They go
directly to Jorgc's booth.

Gina steps out, slowly walks through the crowd: Jorge is
arguing with one of the detectives, who's trying to lead him
out. By the time Gina is standing at his booth, one of the
officers has been forced to cuff him. Her crew (along with a
large crowd) has gathered behind her to witness Jorge's
humiliation.

GINA
(continuing; shocked)
I can NOT believe it.

DET. #1
(to Gina)
Ms. Morris? You were right. We're
booking him on breaking and
entering, vandalism and grand
theft.

GINA
How'd you finally figure it out?

The detective motion back, to Lola.

DET. #1
She broke his alibi. Brought the
"friend" in who confessed. And
then his prints matched. Easy.

Gina stares at Lola.

LOLA
(quietly)
I know Carla Rodriguez from way
back. Just had to convince her it
was worth it to tell the truth.

Gina gives Lola a grateful nod, then walks up to Jorge.

JORGE
I've got lawyers, I'm going to sue
you for defamation-

GINA
Give it up. You got what you had
coming. You the creative genius
with the vision, remember? How
else d'you think this would have
gone?

Jorge glares at her.

GINA
(continuing)
Tryin' to run me out, steal what's
mine. You did me a favor, Jorge.
Helped me figure out I don't need
anything but what I got right here.

She put a fist to her chest. Jorge stares at her, unable to
come back with anything. The police lead him out. One of the
detectives turns back to Gina.

DET. #1
(motioning to Jorge‘s
booth)

He's not gonna be working for a
long time. You're free to take

back anything that's rightfully
yours...we're shutting him down.

Gina smiles, notices Lynn, stopping the other detective.

LYNN
(pointing to the
inspector)
I'd take a good look at HIM.
Fool‘s been linin' his pockets.

Gina is about to step in and translate, whens

DET. #2
Yeah, I'd gotten a whiff o‘ the
dung he's been muckin' in, all
right.

He‘s got a country accent as strong and unintelligible as
Lynn's. Gina laughs, can't believe it as Det. #2 heads for
the inspector.

James, staring at Lola, steps up to her.

JAMES
(to Lola)
This is a GOOD look for you—

LOLA
(flirting)
Really? You think so?

JAMES
I've BEEN thinking so.

He nods, takes her hand and pulls her away. Valerie comes up
to her mother, slips an arm around her waist, and points to
James and Lola: they're kissing now, leaning against each
other.

119.

VALERIE
(whispered)
Look! Are they gonna have sex?

GINA
No! No one has sex until they're
married. Remember?

VALERIE
I thought he was gay.

Lynn, Darnelle and Ashley are cracking up.

DARNELLE
Guess NOT.

Gina pulls Valerie close, an arm around her shoulder. She
looks down at her, filled with love and pride.

GINA
Time to go, baby. I got to drop a
check off at your school. The
girls can cover here.

VALERIE
New? Right now?

Everyone is looking at Gina, smiling, proud: they know what
this means for her.

GINA
Right now. Nothin' else I‘d rather
do.

OFF Gina and Valerie, wee
CUT TO:
INT. PRISON 7 DAY

We follow an inmate in his 'blues' as he rounds a corner
joins a line of men waiting outside of a cell. We PAN
the line of rough looking inmates, tattooed, pierced,
scarred. At the end of the line, we finally catch sight of
Jorge, standing over a Chair, shaving one head after another
with a pair of rusty clippers. Behind him, the Inspector
sweeps up the clippings...
