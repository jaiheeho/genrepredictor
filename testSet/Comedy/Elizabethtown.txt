EUZABETHTOWN

The music of The Hollies” “Jews Was A Crossmaker" begins. It’s a quiet, stately song, ﬁt for an

ending. And though this is only the beginning, perhaps we sense something grand and ﬁnal is
about to occur. . .

FADE IN:

A LARGE INDUSTRIAL TRUCK ' ‘

backs into a close shot. Mighty steel doors swing upward to reveal an entire truck full of shoe
boxes. Many, many boxes of shoes, marked with aloud black stamp: RECALL. Camera slides

right, as another gleaming truck opens its back doors to reveal similar cargo. And another. And
another. Two dock-workers share a rueful, knowing look.

DOCK WORKER#1 - ‘

(to the shoes)
Welcome back, boys.

They begin the task of unloading this colossal shipment.

VOICE

As somebody once said, there is a diﬁ’erence
between a failure...

HIGH-ANGLE

Twenty-two trucks unloading the shoe boxes We are on the outskirts of the gorgeous “campus”

of a famous shoe company whose world hendquartersare right herein the wilds of Oregon, just
outside Portland.

VOICE
and a ﬁasco.

INT. MERCURY SHOE CORPORATE HELICOPTER — DAY

DREW BAYLOR is 27. He sits rigidly upright, a man facing his destiny, even though he’s
seated backwards. He’s the only passenger in this company helicopter whistling over the tops of

tall Oregon trees In the distance, the magniﬁcent Mount Hood. Drew looks at the large open
side—window to the helicopter. It beckons, a tempting way out.

 

pr
EXT. MERCURY SHOE HEADQUARTERS —- DAY - HIGH ANGLE

The spazk that is Drew now exits the still-whirring helicopter which has just touched down at the
top of the tallest building of this important-looking compound. The voice cominueshelpﬁilly, calm
but resigned. ._1 . I l I
VOICE
A failure is simply the non-pres‘ence of success.
Any fool can accomplish failure.

PILOT
Watch your head —

Drew looks upwards at the slicing helicopter blades.

DREW
(unconvincing)
I’m ﬁne.

f INT. MERCURY SHOE HEADQUARTERS — DAY

Drew wears a security i.d. badge as he walks the hallway. Young powerful types, all “casually”
dressed, swivel back in chairs, frozen in mid-meeting as they see him. We know the look It’s our
own look as we try hard not to gaze at a passing wreck on the highway.

VOICE
But a ﬁasco...

Drew arrivesat another hallway juncture, a little unsure of his direction. He chooses the left path.
He nods to people as he walks. Our narrator’s thoughtﬁil voice belongs to Drew, of course, and it
stands in great contrast to his deceptively cheerﬁal public front. , .

DREW’S VOICE
a “ﬁasco" is a diSaster of mythic proportions. A
ﬁasco is afoIk-rale told to others, that makes other
people feel more alive... because it didn 't happen to them.

DREW
(ﬂatly)
I’m ﬁne.
( INT. MERCURY SHOES HALLWAY - DAY

Drew arrives at the desk of ELLEN KISEIVIORE, 24. She’s a high—level assistant with great

 

 

.r‘,

‘J

style, poise, memorable green eyes and a few too many magazine photos of Jude Law on her

cubicle wall. She greets Drew with a not-quite-disguised look of horriﬁed concern. Frankly, she’s
shocked he’s still on two feet. Just looking at Ellen almost comforts him.

. . ELLEN
1...! . ' '
DREW
(quietly)
I’mﬁne.

At another time, they would haye made clever small-talk, perhaps even openly discussed their
eighteen-month aﬁ‘air. But there is no time for that now.

I’ll take you to Phil so you don‘ get lostr '.

INT. CLOSED HALLWAY — DAY

Drew and Ellen zip down a corridor on a cart. Think about a long hallway at LAX, the kind with
children’s artwork on the sides. Replace the artwork with valuable masterpieces from American
painters, and you’ve got the idea about this inner—sanctum passageway reserved for an elite few.

DREW’S VOICE

Mercury Worldwide Shoes... which is actually Phil...
contains some of America’s ﬁnest artists’ masterworks...
seen only by people heading for very important meetings,
a promotion... ' ' '

Drew looks at Ellen with unabashed love. The paintings zip by. She looks at him with
increasingly distant aﬂection.

DREW’S VOICE
or otherwise.

INT. “TI-IE PEN” - DAY

Drew and Ellen pass “The Pen," an open work-space ﬁlled with desks and employees. Large
monitors ﬁll every desk. Such is the state of the new global workplace -— all we see are the tops of
their heads. (Visﬂale are cutting-edge souvenirs and sign-posts of worldwide culture.)

DREW’S VOICE
We are not just employees, as Phil once said, we are
“Denizens of Greatness."

 

 

r . .
-‘ ' SERIES OF SHOTS - DREW‘S WORK WORLD
1) Drew at monitor studying the leg and foot movements of animals.

DREW’S VOICE
Phil says — the world is hill of those who coast through '
life, who achieve through negativity or theft.

2) Drew at a zoo studying the way a monkeejumps, taking notes.

DREW” S VOICE

We succeed through original thought. But there
are sacriﬁces for a goal like pure greatness...

3) On a calendar.

DREW’S VOICE
birthdays, major holidays...

4) Drew’s family — father MITCH, mother HOLLIE, sister HEATHER, her daughter ISIS.

Family gather at a table for Christmas. Drew, absent, is represented by a framed photo on a buffet

table... and an empty seat.

DREW’S VOICE
though we sometimes celebrate odd things at Mercury,
like the day the Italians invented mbber. Which they didn '1,
of course, but that’s beside the point. ~ -

S) “The Pen” is transformed into a pseudo-kegger. Drew, 3 non-dancer, dances wildly.

6) Drew on escalator at ofﬁce. Shot splits into two... then four screens, then folds back into one
large think-tank where Drew studies media and culture from around the world. '-

DREW’S VOICE
I once went four days without speaking. It was fantastic.

6) Drew at desk, on his phone, early morning.

DREW
David! How’s the weather?

( -. DREW’S VOICE
) ' ‘ ' Each of us has a exact counterpart in the Region 3
Headquarters in Taiwan. Nﬁne is named David Tan.

 

 

Every day, we download thoughts to each other -
we are two sides of the same brain-trust.

rm. TAIWAN OFFICE - NIGHT

DAVID TAN, 45, works long hodrs. Just the top of his head is visible behind his monitor.

DAVID TAN
Drew! How's the weather?

INT. PHIL’S OUTER OFFICE — DAY — PRESENT TIME

The cart slows to Phil’s outer otﬁce. No words, no sign proclaiming his name. Just two frosted-
glass doors.

DREW’S VOICE}
Any true student of ﬁmctional shoe design is also a student
of Phil himself. He is a master. . And his innate wisdom

of what people want and need... has never hailed to date.
He is also obsessed with the number two.

A matching set of two Norman Rockwell paintings adorn the outer wall.

DREW‘S VOICE
These are Phil’s prized two Norman Rockwells, the

pair of paintings that once hung outside the White
House Ofﬁce of John F. Kennedy...

We now see a matching set of two Security Guards in bulky jackets, attempting not to look
ominous... which of course, makes them look more ominous. Security Guard # 1 (MEL) feels

Drew’s pain. They’ve bantered happily in the past. Today Mel sends him a solemn silent message
of compassion.

DREW
(with little conviction)
I’m ﬁne.

DREW'S VOICE
And yes, the two frosted doors Phil once purchased
hour a church on a vacation in Tunisia and had
sent back home for a total cost too enormous to mention.

(conﬁdes)
$763,000. Each

Two Older Assistants - Moneypenny types — sit at two desks, nodding quietly as they listen over
headsets. One of them holds up two ﬁngers — as in noryet.

ASSISTANT # 1
Just two more minutes and I can send you in.

Drew nods, looking around, killing time before his date with destiny.

DREW’ S VOICE
Because we have a moment here, let me tell you that -
I am a secret connoisseur of “last looks.” The way "
people look at you when they believe it’s for the
last time... I collect these looks and...

ASSISTANT # 2

(interrupting voice-over)
Okay, he’s ready for you.

Ellen sends Drew through the two frosted doors.

f \ INT. PHIL‘S OFFICE — DAY

Drew looks back to see Ellen quietly disappear on the other side of these frosted doors.

DREW’S VOICE
there’s one right now.

It somehow feels quite signiﬁcant. Drew is now utterly alone. Well, almost alone. Phil’s large
ofﬁce is sunlit, wide-open, and inside it... time has stopped. There is a collection of deeply-
comfortable brown-leather chairs, two large-screen televisions featuring state-of-the-art video
games abandoned in mid-pursuit, and at the far end corner, a sun-bathed ﬁgure sits thoughtfully
looking out at the trees. Phil is waiting, and somehow Drew knows to approach carefully. To his

left, a large-screen computer monitor giugs with the sound of a screen-saver aquarium.

PHIL
How are you, Drew?

DREW
I wanted to jump out the window of that helicopter,
and just splatter on the trees, to tell you the truth.
/ PHIL
) (half-hearted)
’ Don’t do that. It’s only money.

 

(I

And it is rather clear in his cadence that money is maybe the only important thing in Phil's world.
Drew has not been invited to sit in the empty chair next to Phil, so he stands. A young man in a
very, very large space. Ifonly he knew what to do, what to say. But he doesn’t. Phil takes a
single sip from each of two cups of tea that sit before him. I '

. ' PHIL . . . .
The American psyche is in turmoil. And we
have rniscalculaied.

DREW
I’m... sorry.

PHIL , .
I have no mic—book for this situation.
(bunny) . . '
They tell me we’re about to lose 972 million dollars.
I’m ill-equipped in the philosophies of failure.

INT. INDOOR GYMNASIUM —- DAY

They walk together on the upper-tier observation platform. Below'is a gymnasium floor, where a
pro-Basketball team works out. Phil pauses brieﬂy to regard these ﬁne athletes.

PHIL '
My basketball team They don’t even know yet.

TNT. COURTYARD - DAY

Phil and Drew arrive in an indoor arboretum courtyard. The expanse of this company
headquarters is consistently surprising.

DREW
I understand you have to let me go.

PHIL
(it’s understood)

How do I make the concept of 972 million dollars
more real to you?

_ DREW
It is very real to me, Phil.

This we know, as Phil begins to talk. He is a fan of his own melliﬂuous voice, particularly u he
discusses the subject of money.

PHIL
(thoughtful)
Well. It’s the operating budget of a mid—size
country. A small civilization. It’s big, it’s so big
that you could round it of to... a billion dollars.
(beat)
I cry a lot lately.

DREW
In every possible way, I feel responsible.

PHIL
(really not listening)

A hugely—successﬁrl American company, built by my own
family, the blood of my own family, merging last year
with DCS Industries on the promise of a global future
pinned to a groundbreaking shoe — your design — with a
new style of material, launched this week to great fanfare

r “ and now meeting a growing international roar of laughter
and rejection, enough to cause this memo from Jeffrey Barlow
CEO of DCS, “this once highly~anticipated product may
actually cause an entire generation to return to bare feet."
We are about to enter a ﬁ'ee-fall plunge. And the sound you
hear is the sound of shit hitting the fan, globally.

Drew is stricken. For a moment we bear the whistling sound of wind.

DREW
I wish there was something I could do.

PHIL

Actually, there is.

(with suspicious compassion)
Sitting in a room downstairs is a reporter from
Modern Business Journal. He’s one of the good
guys. He’ll help us ifhe can. The story of our
recall will break in a week, this Monday, and
you know, whatever you want to say - within
parameters * would be wonderful.

/
' 3 Drew takes it in. He is a loyal warrior to the end.

 

 

PHIL
For example, we need him to understand. We
hired you from our National Scholarship. program.
We supported, invested in your brilliance. This
was a very creative endeavor.

(pause).
And I think you should stand up for your incredible work.

Drew stares at his once fatherly rolemodel. Now Phil is all reﬂective

surface, a false front of
support. It looks like another last look, unmistakably so.

DREW

(as in goodbye)
Thank you. '
PHIL '
You okay?

Drew slowly nods. He wants to say “I'm ﬁne,” but can’t quite get there.

* DREW
I’m f...

INT. MERCURY SHOES HALLWAY — DAY

Drew arrives at the conference room door, flanked by Ellen and Mel (Security Guard # I). It feels
like an execution, and in fact it is. Drew stands at the door. Inside the Reporter waits. Drew
looks down the long hallway, and considers running for" freedom. It’s too late. '

DREW
Well Ellen...

He’s about to say “wish me luck.” ‘

ELLEN
Drew. Phil asks that you not talk about him at all.

REW
At all?

ELLEN
(takes a breath)
He wants you to take all the... credit.

Ellen smiles distantly. Quietly, a lover’s negotiation:

ELLEN
Are you going back tonight?

DREW . .
No I was gonna stay... that was the plan, right? I v‘ '

ELLEN
Plans change, Drew.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Drew faces the gimlet-eyed reporter, HERBIE GONSALVES, 46, a pokervfaced professional.
0n the table before them are Drew’s conceptual drawings of the now-infamous shoe. It is a boldly
designed shoe, with a very wide base, festooned with miss-crossing colorful designs. We notice
it‘s name in the sketches — Spasmotica. Nearby, 3 copy of last Week’s Modern Business Journal.

REPORTER
And did Phil approve the designs, and work closely
with you on The Spasmotica‘?

DREW

(glumiy)
Actually it‘s pronounwd “Spaas-motica.”

REPORTER
Of course, there’s an ‘ﬁnnlaut" — I’m sorry.
So it’s “spizz” or... “spowze”... ?

DREW
(evenly)
He set me free to do whatever I wanted.

The Reporter looks at Drew with pen suspended over a small-sized notebook. The smell of
corporate violence is in the air, The pack needs to devour a wounded animal. Gonsalves offers
one ﬁnal chance for survival before writing a death sentence.

REPORTER
Your design your vision.. completely?

And that’sB - a - i...?

DREW
B-a-y...l-o-r...

Drew’s life ﬂashes before him. several times. The Reporter sets pen to paper, shaking his head
slightly as he scribbles in his notebook. Drew eyes his name being written upside-down,

mesmerized by the scratching sound, and the enormity of the effect this small act will now, have on
his destiny.

DREW
When does this run? A week?

REPORTER
A week. Actually, six days... by Sunday evening
it’ll be on the stands... can you believeI don’t
have longer to write a piece like this? It’s
gonna be tough for me.

DREW
That’s... that’s too bad.

But for you. It’s a little bit like knowing the plane

Ellen lingers a bit, putting a ﬂesh security i.d. badge on a handsome new Recniit, as Drew passes.

DREW
(to Ellen) ‘
Hey, so - .

Ellen doesn't even look at Drew. He turns to see her hand seductively guide his replacement down

the corridor. The movement of her hand on the recruit’s back is mesmerizing in its brutal message.
This is what it feels like to be erased.

ON GLASS I AR

Drew drops his security badge into the container by the exit. It clinks with ﬁnality.

on DREW '

watching Ellen walk away. He knows he’s supposed to leave with dignity, knows this with every

bone in his body... but instead, giving way to feelings of disbelief and anxiety, he moves in the
opposite direction, towards her.

DREW
Hey - this is really silly. You probably don’t
realize how this is coming off.

Ellen turns, the panic of public embarrassment in her eyes. Two Mercury Guards now ﬂank Drew,
easing him backwards as co-workers watch.

DREW

The guards deposit Drew on the other side of the tinted glass separating Mercury Shoes Earn the ’ '
rest of the world. He stands alone, in near silhouette. '

SUDDEN. CUT TO

MOVING MEDIUM SHOT

Drew suddenly appears again on the other side

of the tinted glass, moving alongside 'what he can
barely make out of Ellen and the new recnrit.

(Theme indicates this as a “last look” at Ellen)

DREW ‘
(muﬁled)
Ellen... listen... wait... l

EXT. MERCURY WINDOW - AFTERNOON

Drew is on the other side of the tinted glass. He cannot follow any further. He stands alone in the

courtyard of the gorgeous campus, locked-out on this beautiful day, as casually dressed and
oblivious employees move past him. ‘ '

DREW’S VOICE .
I found myself thinking about my Taiwanese counterpart
in Region 3. David Tan. What would happen to him?

EXT. MERCURY BUILDING — AFTERNOON
Sunlight glints 03‘ the comer of the Mercury Tower.

DREw’s VOICE

(ﬁghting it all om)
And in that moment I knew. Success — success —-

not greatness... was the only God the entire world served.

The sun disappears behind the building. Drew takes a last look at his former world, the courtyard,

the people, a company trash-can, and ﬁnally himselfin the reﬂected windows.

EXT. DREW'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Drew walks up the steps, passing a cute Artsy Girl and her Boyﬁiend.

Oh Drew. We’re having a party on Friday,
so if you’ re home working, there will be noise.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY — NIGHT

Drew’s personal ritual. He turns the key and shoves his shoulder into the front door just

so. Door
swings open, as theme beginsﬁ .

'

INT. DREW’S APARTMENT —NIGHT . '

Drew shuts the door to his stark, smallish apartment. This is the solitary existence of a man who
does not “entertain.” It’s dominated by a television, stacks of video games, and two ﬁ'amed
Spasmotica prototypes (in different stages of painstaking development) on the wall. A laptop
glows with a Spasmotica screensaver and some sketches sit ,on a small kitchen table. He sets
down his things. He takes a look around, lets outla breath. Home sweet home.

INT. DREW’S KITCHEN — NIGHT

Drew’s kitchen drawer opens, taking theme music out. Drew withdraws a Ginzu knife from the
kitchen drawer. It’s in a special case reading: “The Sharpest Knife in the World — As Advertised.”
The knife is long, thin, and savage with a serrated blade. We know this knife from late-night tv
infomercials, where a burly chef ﬁrst hurls tomatoes at-the knife, which slices them cleanly, and
then smoothly cuts steel with it; Drew feels the blade, auditions the act of plunging it deep into his
chest. Yes,'this is the right knife.

WIDER SHOT

Ever the designer, with focused intensity, Drew tests the efﬁciency of this machine before u§mg it
himself. He presses “on,” and stands back to observe... .

THE MACHINE

It bucks powerfully, the knife stabbing insistently into the air, into the exact spot where his heart
will soon be. .

ON DREW

He admires the clean efﬁciency of his suicide machine. Clearly, anyone seated in this machine will
be the victim of a special kind of Bari—Kari. It works. It‘s perfect. He turns it 013‘. Ah, but one
thing is missing... and he knows what it is. Drew exits and returns with a pair of the villainous

Spasmoticas. He ties the laces together and hangs them from the handlebars. This is perfection.

EXT. DREW'S APARTMENT — NIGHT

With the decision, has come freedom. With an almost skip in his step, Drew places a box of his

clothes, a wicker chair, the television, videos, camera, and all his belongings by the trash bins
behind his apartment.

INT. DREW’S APARTMENT — NIGHT — MINUTES LATER

Drew climbs into the seat. The place is neat, and empty. Now gripped with a real sense of

purpose, he regards the “on" switch. We hear a very subtle chirp, an innocuous ascending ring.

It’s the hushed reminder that his cell-phone rests on the table nearby. It‘s not hard to ignore, so he
does. The call goes to voice-mail with a ﬁnal beep.

ON THE GAFFER’S TAPE

which weakens as the knife begins to droOp. Drew adjusts the knife, adding more gaffer’s tape'.
He is now completely focused and utterly centered. The phone chirps again. Drew doesn’t hear it,
as he takes a breath.

ON THE ON SWITCH

his ﬁnger rests on it.

And ﬁnally Drew becomes aware of the continuing ring. Vlfrth zen-like calm; he rises and brings
the phone back to his seat. He is completely at peace, almost cheerful:

It‘s HEATHER, 25, his sister. Heather is ever—burdened-with-responsibiljty.

Drew nods knowingly. Of course it’s bad news. Is there any other'lcind of news?

DREW .. .

HEATHER'S VOICE
No. , .
DREW

Could you call me a little later?
HEATHER’ S VOICE

He regards the “on” switch. It beckons.

DREW
Ten minutes?

HEATHER’S VOICE
Dad died.

This bad news is a deep physical blow. He goes limp with the impact.

HEATH'ER’S VOICE
(barreling forward)
He had a heart attack, back in Kentucky. He was
still visiting Uncle Dale. Mom’s in total shock.
You've got to handle this -

Drew’s eyes close. His back hunches. The day has now reached ghastly, unfathomably bad
proportions. He listens to his sister’s shaky voice.

INT. PORTLAND AIRPORT - NIGHT

HOLLIE BAYLOR is moving ﬁrn'ously forward through the Portland Airport terminal. At 57,
Drew’s mother still carries her collegiate good—looks and a school-girl’s obsession with the biggest
questions of life. Carefree people have often patted her on the shoulder and said, “Hey, just have a
good time.” But as we meet her, all her worst fears have come true. Into frame comes Heather,
Drew’s sister and now Drew himself, holding a garment bag and a backpack. It’s a blizzard of
adrenalized conversation. They are commandos trying to outrun grief.

Drew hits the garment bag from the conveyor belt, and is immediately stopped by two Airwn
Security Guards.

GUARD # 1

INT. ANOTHER SECURITY AREA — NIGHT

The two Guards search and interrogate Drew, as a third silent Guard in fatigues sits watching with
a machine gun at his side. From time to time, he taps information into an open laptop.

GUARD # 2 ..
You made this plane reservation at the last minute.

DREW
It’s a family emergency.

Guard # 1 casts a knowing glance over at Guard # 2, the ‘jfmnily emergency” line. Guard # 2
ﬁnds a small pair of scissors, and shows it to Guard # 1. They look at each other meaningfully —
the case against Drew is growing. They regard the tiny weapon like a bomb of epic proportions.

GUARD # 2

DREW
Take it.
GUARD # 1

Have you ever attended school overseas?

DREW "
One semester in Germany.

The Guards openly share their most powerful look yet. They look at the two very different suits in

Drew’s garment bag. One is a standard iswe. The other is The Blue Suit. It immediately

fascinates them. It’s not quite in fashion, strangely anonymous. Purposely (anonymous? The
Guards ﬂick looks to each other.

men, large and small. A silent moment passes between them. Guard # 2 gives Drew a sympathetic
pat on the shoulder. Guard # 3 holds out the plastic container with the Beautiful You baggie.

Drew takes it, aclmowledging the most menacing guard’s gesture of kindness. The three men

share one last wordless moment in the security area. We hear the shimmering guitar introduction

of the song that serve as a musical signpost for the movie, Claire’s Theme.

The sight is rather overwhelming to Drew. A human body. His father... without breath. J Behind
him, Charles Dean assumes The Pose. Head down, hands clasped, pastoral. He is, aﬁer all, an

expert mourner. Drew turns to him, as if up until this moment, it all could have been a-terrible
mistake.

DREW

There he is.

It’s an enormously intimate moment. He draws closer, to the side of the casket. He passes

through many emotions, ending on a slightly perplexed look. Charles Dean notices an oddness' in
Drew’s reaction.

Drew is silent. He continues looking, new curious.

I don’t know what the word is. It’sjust a look I
never saw before. A look on his face.

In small ways, assisted by the lighting in this room, the expression actually does change... in small
but seemingly inﬁnite variations. ‘

DREW
Hey — why not? Whimsical.

Drew stares. He reaches forward carefully, and touches the knuckles on his father’s ﬁngers. They
are hard and cold. He keeps looking at that face, the odd upbeat expression, as he stands alone in

the large room with Mitch. Drew tilts his head and moves to various vantage points to stare more
careﬁiily at his father, as music continues.

A high-pitched intensity swirls around Drew. And he just happens to bc_!in the beating heart of this '
home — the kitchen. Vﬁth JessieBaylor at his side, Drew is given a plate With a large piece of
yellow pie (Chess Pie, a regional Favorite) by 65 year-old silver-blonde (AUNT) DORA , ' "

of a woman. LENA, her older sister, moves nearby, always the co-hostess. (Lena: “How's your
mother, how” 5 Hollie?") Drew watches the unSpoken synchronicity of these cooks, moving
swiﬁly, holding plates of food, never bumping into each other as they expertly cook for many.
They have swung into action. Three people talk to Drew simultaneously, one a tearﬁil shy -
girlﬁ'iend (CONNIE) of his father’s ﬁ‘om a long time ago. She slips a high-school picture of Mitch
into his hands. All around him, he sees bits and pieces of facial similarities. Music continues, as
we see a portrait of Southern culture, the likes of which is‘ entirely foreign to Drew.

seeing him drink it. “No it’s good,” Drew says. The guests, eager to talk to the visiting star, are

too close to his face. Behind him on the wall is a Praying Hands sculpture. Moving in the close

environment, he knocks down the Praying Hands, and is given that too, along with more photos of
his father. Someone’s voice says, pointedly: “We always wanted to lotow you better.”

2) All burners on the stove are operating at full

-blast. Hush puppies... Corn fritters... Chicken...
and nearby...- . . . '

3) A table with Ham. A four-year old boy pops into the shot. He‘s got ﬁery mischief in his eyes.
He is SAMSON BAYLOR, and he eyes the ham with intent. He too holds an Ale-8 and is

already chewing something else. Drew meets another Cousin: “Uncle Mitch always wanted us to
meet. Everybody says we look alike.” There is only the vaguest similarity.

4) Aunt Dora is assured that Bill Banyon is not showing up. She appears mightily relieved. (The

words “Bill Banyon” should become more and more prevalent, as in “Thank God Bill Banyon isn’t
coming”)

5) UNCLE ROY, 56 and skinny, is asleep in the living room with television on, dreaming an old
man’s dreams. Nearby Teenagers, beset with long faces and light acne, fumble with an impossible

J group of remote controls, none of which seem to help operate a new TWO/VCR system.

6) Drew moves through the main part of the house, toward the living room, and he spots Samson

by the ham. Jesse introduces Drew to a pretty 16 year—old girl, whispering “Mona is a stare-er."
We meet MONA, who has a very compelling stare. Just as Samson feels he’s not being watched, -
he slips the ham off the table and lets two nearby dogs erupt into a dogﬁght over it, Samson

escapes unseen, as the dogs are blamed. Aunt Lena' says: “Jennifer, get the dogs out of here!"
Uncle Roy sleeps through it all. . ' ‘ .

‘7) The ham is quickly rescued, washed and re—dressed.

8) Dora pulls out a Ginzu knife and starts cutting the ham, as Drew stands nearby. The blade is '
familiar to Drew, and he looks at it like a lover with whom he still has a planned rendevous. Jessie
whispers in Drew’s ear throughout, always informing him of the players and the playing ﬁeld'.

9) Jessie attempts to conﬁscate, an Ale-8 from Samson‘s hands. Samson wriggles away.
10) Camera catches some of the memorabilia and photos being handed to Drew.

1 1) Sad guy just sitting there, holding a cigarette, looking sad. i

12) Samson unravels scotch tape, sees bananas, looks subversive.

l3) Teenagers by the television continue to struggle. Others are now enlisiedJo try and ﬁx the
'I'IVOIVCR.

14) Drew easily ﬁxesrthe complicated remote control system, and he meets a local star Basketball
Player girl (still wearing jersey).

15) Samson wedges the banana in the spigot of the pantry water-dispenser.

16) Twin teenage girls show off a dance routine, which cheers up some of the more obviously
grieving elders. ' ' "

l7) Samson screams next to Uncle Roy, and wakes him up, as he runs out the front door. Uncle

Roy asks absently: “ls Bill Banyon here?" A chorus comforts hint, “No, probably not.” Uncle Roy
goes back to sleep.

18) Drew is still surrounded by friends and family, all offering condolences. Uncle Dale arrives to
say, “easy now, he's been through a lot, and just ‘cause his daddy liked to talk doesn’t mean he

does." Behind Dale, 8 car backs down the driveway. “Dale, isn’t that your car? Who’s in that
czar?” “Where are my keys?”

19) Jessie comes out of the bathroom. “What’s going on?” Aunt Dora feeds him beans from a

spoon. Like a child. “It’s your son. He flooded the closet with the water dispenser. And right
now, he’s driving Dale's car.”

behavior. ' y

INT. AUNT DORA‘S House—micrn — LATER...

There is an immediate ripple. Someone has seen him turning up the walkway. A moment later,
BILL BANY ON, 54, walks in the horn door. Everything about him screams — mid-level slickster.
He’s untrustworthy, not as brilliant as he believes he is, and clearly arrogant. But here‘s the catch.
He’s fun. Rumor and innuendo becomes him. He simply has no shame, as he announces:

BILL BANYON .‘

So you obviously made a group decision not to
call and invite me. '

Beat. No one responds. Banyon explodes into a smile, extending a hand to the ﬁrst stranger he
sees, moving through the crowd like a politician with a checkered background.

BILL BANYON -'
Hi. Bill Banyon... '

(moving through crowd) I
I hear Drew Baylor is here... how you doing?
how you doing, Bill Banyon...

Banyon spots a woozy Samson. He kneels down to. him.
‘ BILL BANY ON ' '
Is this Samson? How you doing, Samson?

Give me a Big Boy’s hug —

Jessie and Drew watch as Samson rewards Banyan with the entire contentsofannpset stomach
The splatter hits Banyon and, to a much lesser degree, carpet and linen.

BILL BANY ON
Okay! Okay then... okay... nice to see you too.

His face locked into detached bemusement, Drew absorbs the emotional cacophony of human
behavior swirling around him.

EXT. AUNT DORA'S HOME — NIGHT

The windows and doors of the house are wide open, as the living room is aired out. Out of
necessity, the dinner has moved outdoors. The house looks beautiful, lit from within.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD — NIGHT

Drew and Jessie jog through the center of the street, an unlikely looking pair weighed down with
stuff. Drew tightly holds his bag, a few artifacts, food-containers and the Praying Hands. Jessie
holds his son, asleep and slung over his shoulder. On either side, there is the blue glow of houSes
lit up by living room television. It feels good to be moving again, away from the crowd. They

arrive at Jessie‘s small house. Samson is still asleep over Jessie’s shoulder. A few ﬁreflies snap
and buzz.

and hold onto it for ﬁfty years.

J Drew smiles at his outspoken cousin, and nods as in - better get to bed.

JESSIE
But then, you and your dad were close.

As Drew watches Jessie slaps pajamas on the sleepy kid:

Oh very close. I knew him very, very well. He was my ‘
Dad! We were actually going to... drive here together...
this year... and it became next year... and no, I knew him
very well. Very, very well. '

And it’s obvious in the extra beat we stay on Drew that he didn’t know his father well at all.

INT. MUSIC/GUEST ROOM — NIGHT
Jessie shows Drew the guest room, which also functions as an “,oﬁice.” Shelves of toys and knick-

knacks share space with band equipment, broken boom boxes, concert tickets, a concert poster on
the wall. And a lonely-looking futon.

DREW '

This will be perfect. I love it. I can sleep anywhere.
JESSIE
You in my house, man. This is great. The

circumstances are not great. But we are cousins,
brother. Brother, we are cousins. That was my band.

Jessie points out the poster, as he pulls out pillows and clears kid toys from the ﬂoor. (Jessie is r
clearly a big kid with toys, trying to raise a smaller kid with toys.)

ON POSTER
it reads: Winchester Summerfest, featuring Lynyrd Skynyrd.
JESSIE
This is the show we opened for Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Two of the original members!

Drew sees the long list of performing bands listed on the poster, squints and ﬁnds the tiny letters at I
the bottom of the bill... Ruckus. We start to hear a sleepy whine in the next room. Samson stirs.

~ DREW

Ruckus?

JESSIE
Ruckus,

Jessie nods proudly and quietly, as Drew looks over some memorabilia from the failed band.

DREW
And now you for computers. . '

JESSIE
I’ve taken the year oﬁ" for hard thought... tough thinking.
Something big has happened...-'or is happen-hing, and I
want to be the guy who puts his ﬁnger on it. Creatively.

y .
i , He laughs to himself. Drew laughs a little too, studies the poster. Behind him, Jessie sings
spontaneously, acappella, a verse from his own composition, “Same In Any Language.” Drew
listens uncomfortably, unsure how to respond or where to look a: Jessie sings: .

JESSIE
“Those postcards I sent from Birmingham
All the way ﬁ'om the windows of Amsterdam.
Copped a gram ﬁom Dapper Sam

Just a four-letter man in. another jam... " 4.
Oh yeah... “

Next door, Samson fully wakes and erupts into a sustained howl. Jessie discounts the noise like ,'
the seasoned father of a loud child. Drew takes a breath, politely nods, and looks around the

room, imagining the next seven hours or so. The child is loud. We hear a quiet knocking along -
the wall.

INT. MUSIC/GUEST ROOM — LATER NIGHT
Window pane shadows slash the darkened room. A fluttering almost-human form moves across
the room. (It’s the front porch ﬂag’s shadow.) Drew hears a low scratching noise. It’s an old

leaﬂess tree that scrapes across the window in the wind. The branch scrapes again. Drew
imagines:

HOLLIE’S VOICE
“His spirit is still hovering... looking for a place
to land... “

Another other~worldly sound now catches his attention. It’s just next door. Now the leaﬂess tree
branch scrapes again. The other—worldly whine grows louder, ﬁ'om behind the wall. We begin to
realize that it’s actually Debbie. And now we hear Jessie’s sounds of pleasure. The wind kicks
up, and the tree branch scrapes insistently Drew now bears a mournﬁrl banshee wail. It’s

Drew with bag backpack with Praying Hands peeking out, and food containers at the front desk.
A wedding party has taken over much of the hotel. Balloons and banners read: Chuck and Cindy
Hasboroll Lovin’ Lifell Lovin’ Each Other 24-7!! Chuck and Cindy are featured in sunglasses,
posed together. Clearly it’s their favorite photo — it‘s evemvhere. Drew is so tired it all looks
pleasingly surreal. Before him is a super-professional young Southern DESK GIRL
(CHARLOTTE), 20. And she is memorable for this trait. She types at her computer, sending

information to a database that only she sees. She types dutifully and steade from the ﬁrst moment
we meet her. And she never stops.

CHARLOTTE

DREW
Two nights.

Her typing speeds up a beat.

CHARLOTTE
Are you with the Hasboro Wedding? Chuck and Cindy?

She’s typing, and he hasn’t even answered yet.

DREW
No. I’m leaving on Friday.

She nods with a private look of relief. Her typing modulates slightly.

CHARLOTTE
Are you a member of any major Travel program?

DREW
(realizes)
I have a coupon.

It’s still in his pocket. Drew shows her the coupon. Charlotte’s typing becomes suddenly slew

and suspicious, as she looks at it.

CHARLOTTE
I haven’t seen that coupon before.

Just give me the best room you have. Put it o

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY — NIGHT

Drew m0ves down the hotel hallway, key card in hand; weighed down with the cargo of food
containers and mementos. The doors to many of the rooms are ﬂung open. Televisions are on.
The entire hotel seems to be ﬁlled with wedding guests. There’s a 20ish couple at the end. of the
hallway. They part, as friends take them each in different directions. She is bride-to-be CINDY,
an athletic blonde with shiny long hair pulled tightly back, looking over her shoulder at groom-to-

He turns to see Drew, standing at the door to the next room.

CHUCK
(simple realization)
I am the luckiest guy in thelworld.

It’s the plain beauty of a time—wom phrase, said with real feeling. Chuck shuts the door, leaving
Drew oddly happy for this stranger. Suddenly and powerfully, he ‘5 never felt lonelier.

Drew IS on his cell- phone, sitting on the sOfa in t- shirt and shorts and socks His legs are kicked
up on the coffee table. Complimentary toothbrush- and- mouthwash packages stand like pillars on

for human contact. He’s making calls on his cellphone. He looks jagged and exhausted.

festooned with balloons.

The hallway is mostly empty. We hear distant music. The Chuck and Cindy wedding party is
raging elsewhere. Drew feels stupidly alive, with no one watching, as he grooves slightly and

shufﬂes into the back bathroom of an empty party room in search of beer. He ﬁnds a bathtub ﬁlled
with ice and many ﬂoating bottles. ' '

expanse of rolling Kentucky land, dotted with ramshackle cow pastures. There is the sound of
distant early morning garbage trucks, bottles crashing on bottles. Cicadas start up for the new day.
There’s not much to say that they haven’t said already. The threat of a kiss is in the air. Romantic
pressure abounds. Birds are chirping a little too loudly. '

INT HADLEY CREMATORY (LOUISVILLE) — DAY '

A row of Urns. All different sizes and shapes. Moving shots of Drew and Claire examining all the
diﬁ'erent possibilities. A YOUNG WORKER looks on appreciatively, not used to someone as
colorful and lively as Claire in this world that is very much about the opposite. As music
continues, she turns this potentially lugubrious task into an explosion of life. Each looking at
opposite walls of choices, Drew and Claire back into each other unintentionally — it’s their ﬁrst
physical contact. They separate. The Young Worker tums'nis attention to an older couple who
enter. Behind his back, Claire playfully ﬂings one of the urns across the room to Drew, laughing.
When the grieving older couple turn to look at Claire, she’s already serious and respectﬁslly

monochromatic. Drew and the Young Worker share a look The Young worker’s expression is
this-whyyouandnotme? ' H ' ' ‘ '

Now Claire explores a row of oil paintings of benefactors, imitating each of their expressions, even

. a famous Kentucky racehorse. Claire finds a small ﬂag, and eventually she and Drew arrive from

diﬁerent directions in front of one very idiosyncratic Purple Um. She grabs it, and poses Drew on
a viewing bench with the Urn and the ﬂag. She takes an imaginary snapshot. Drew hands the Urn
to the Young Worker. The selection has been made. And somehow, surprisingly, Drew shares a
look with her that could only be described as disbelief — he’s actually just had fun.

. YOUNG WORKER
Just need your signature there... and you can
pick this up tomorrow after the procedure.

EXT. HADLEY CREMATORY (LOUISVILLE) — LATER DAY

Drew and Claire walk together outside, under the shady oaks that line this mock-colonial mansion
that houses the “resting grounds.” Music trails oﬂ‘.

having fun.

She looks at his serious face, and cracks up. He looks right and left. What ’5 sofunny?

Alright. Let’s work through ‘em One by one.
I’m good at this.
DREW ‘

I think there's only one problem, and it’s everything.

DREW
For starters? My dad’s dead! And we were
supposed to get to know each other better,
§ as adults... next year.

CLAIRE
You‘re dealing with it. It happens.

DREW
My mom wants cremation. They don‘t do
cremations in Elizabethtown.

CLAIRE
Not a problem.

Drew gets up to grab a missing utensil. She swivels and studies him, and his every word? »

DREW
There’s an expensive Memorial coming up.

just being the Substitute won’t be enough anymore. -

They still don’t move. Almost kissing. All around her, the mood and lighting and wind and...
everything is perfect. . ‘

DREW
Well... let’s let him live. . , . ,5
It is that moment... and neither move any closer. They are poised at the edge of breaking the
personal barrier, neither wanting to be the ﬁrst to move forward... or away. They almost kiss. He
looks at her lips. Theme begins in the form of an intoxicating piano part, everything willing them
to give in to the romantic abandon.

A man of about 36, clad in denim with red hard-hat, speaks with his foot resting on the ﬁrst step of
a large truck. He’s an unglarnourous character, windblown and ﬂushed with good hard work.

Fiﬂ‘y yards behind him is a house. There is something about RUSTY that commands attention in
young children. In his eyes is the look of purpose.

urn to her. He turns to see...

Claire in evening dress, lingering on outskirts of Chuck and Cindy’s wedding group, looking
gorgeous and holding a bright pink Cosmopolitan. He collapses into the big leather seat near her.
Claire falls into the seat next to him. Silently they watch the Chuck and Cindy traﬁic. She’s had a
few drinks with a few new liiends from the wedding party, who wave goodnight to her. Drew
considers putting the Urn on the ﬂoor. Instead, he puts it on the table between them.

INT. AUGUSTA BALLROOM LOBBY — NIGHT

Balancing her glass, Claire joins Drew in swinging open the heavy doors to the empty hotel
ballroom marked: Hasboro Wedding Rehearsal.

The remains of an earlier function are obvious in the haphazard array of chairs, a cabinet and
catering remnants. Claire drains her drink and heads for the podium. She clicks on the

microphone, and grips both sides of the stand like a Presidential candidate. Her voice is very loud,
and she addresses the empty ballroom. ‘

CLAIRE ‘ - "

She is a bit drunk. Drew laughs politely and applauds.

DREW .

Very nice. Come on —

CLAIRE ,
AND WE’LL SEE YOU ALL AGAIN NEXT YEAR!

She laughs. He takes her arm — it’s physical contact, and for a moment she ﬁnds herselfin his

arms, facing away. This is how their bodies feel together. They’ve inadvertently broken a barrier,
and both know it. She pushes away.

CLAIRE
l’mjust going to say — right now — what we’re not
saying. And let the chips fall, let the chips fall, let
the chipsfall... where they may... yes I’m drunk, and...

They arrive at the Urn. Claire looks at Drew, pregnant with something she needs to say. Drew
sees her discomfort, and ﬁlls in the blanks.

He’s not ajerk. He’s a brilliant man who gives
himself permission to be preoccupied.

DREW
Come on! You know, I’ll tell you, there is nothing greater
than deciding in your life that things maybe really are
black and white. And this guy “Ben” who clearly takes
you for granted, who serially takes advantage of you...
Is bad. And what I’m saying is good. See what I mean?
Black and white. You shouldn’t be a substitute for anybody!
This guy should be right here, right now, doing this.

a little woozy with the pleasure of it all, and then pulls away reluctantly.
DREW
Please don’t take this as rejection.

He ﬁnds her mouth, and there is no way back. They sink to the ground, as he places the urn
recklessly en a table. And this is what it’s like to really kiss her. Alter an interval, they pull away.
They sit there on the floor, disheveled. Claire looks up at the urn on the table. Claire is a little

light-headed. Clearly, it was a great kiss. They are. on the ﬂoor.,'_1'.hey regard each other, and the -

to sit on the edge of the bed. She admires Drew, the sleeping lump facing the wall in a red t-shirt.

them. Content and excited to be with both of them.

BEN
Thanks. that’s amazing... and that’s how you met.

Claire rubs each of their arms, lovingly. Ben takes a last sip of wine.
