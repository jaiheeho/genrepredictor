Beam Me Up, Scotty!

There is no intelligent life on earth...

Stories of an independent band
in Germany

1986 —1992

A ﬁlm by

Screenplay

This Picture is dedicated to musicians everywhere

Who create something from nothing in damp rehearsal rooms

SJLN_O_P_S_LS.

B EAM ME UP, SCOTTY! is a movie about typical life —stories of German musicians with the example of the band of

the same name, The 35mm ﬁlm shows the ups and downs ofthe band in dramatic and tragicomic scenes,

From 1986 to 1992 the six musicians played so—called ”independent music", meaning that they were autonomous and not
under control by the big commercial record labels, The music takes us from the late phases of melodic punk rock to exhilarating

"indie—rap”!

Songs played in the rehearsal room and at four gigs in Krefeld, Hamburg and Berlin were recorded in "Dolby Stereo
SR” to blow the roof ofthe cinema, Get lost in music! We're gonna rock thisjoint tonight! "And we only hope that the plaster

does not come down,,,'I

Exactly what is independent music? How do musicians live? Why don't they have electricity in the rehearsal room? Why
are they able to receive ”Radio Moscow'I on their active bass loudspeaker and are banned from playing live? Why is a singer

sent to prison for contempt?

At night the band runs through deserted, endlessly deep streets somewhere at the edge of the galaxy, How do musicians
living in a small German town feel? They tell their life stories on streets without beginning or end until the stories turn into

music: in the rehearsal room, during gigs, and in the musicians' apartments, Each lyric adds to the issue dealt with before,

The film starts with the band coming back from an open—air gig in Berlin, It is dawn when the musicians finally climb
sleepily out oftheir heap of scrap, When the lead singer returns the borrowed car, drops the car keys into a letter box, writes
"Thanx'I on it with white chalk, and disappears into the sewers ofa shopping street, one thing becomes clear immediately:

this movie is about life and the night,

When the singer peeks through the cracks in the manhole cover to get a look at the outside world, he encounters an
unfamiliar world: the shopping street with its day—to—day routine, the people strolling in the streets, the sound of rustling

shopping bags, and empty stares, The musician turns around and disappears back into the sewers,

BEAM ME UP,SCOTTY! The sound of rockets and suddenly we are thundering over the town and see it lying

underneath, Below, church bells are striking midnight, The deserted streets of the town are bathed in black light, The band,
though, is awake, rehearsing,

Now we perceive the band's world according from their point ofview, The tone of the film changes, Multi—coloured
images replace the colours of everyday life, From now on the frames are monochromatic, Near the end of the film the colours

switch back to ”normal'I again, but the everyday life seems strange and unreal,

During the course ofthe last open—air gig in Berlin we get to meet a community of artists living in Berlin's eastern district
”Prenzlauer Berg”, The band plays in the artists' inner courtyard, side by side with bird people, dinosaurs, ﬂying dogs, and
other actual—size works made of papier maché, At the Berlin gig, North—Rhine area—based BEAM ME UP,SCOTTY!

finally succeed in beaming up, The sound of rockets, The musicians take off together with their audience and ﬂoat towards

another world, the world of music,

The movie audience ends up in everyday life, Now it is their turn to peek through the cracks in the manhole cover to see

what's going in the shopping area,

BEAM ME UP, SCOTTY! There is no intelligent life on Earth,,,

Maybe I should go back to Ireland, to Dublin,,,
You can go into a pub there and order a few beers,,,
And when you've run out of money, you take your guitar and go
out into the street, you sit down, set up your bookwith all the
lyrics and can pull out something that everyone wants to hear,
Well, it's all the same if they want to hear it or not, as long as
they pay! Sometimes you look at them and the people look at you —
right in the face — and they think, "God almighty, is that a bum!‘I
Then they go away and hear the music — then come back and toss their
money in, That's a great feeling,,, But when you're in the rehearsal

room, everybody is totally,,,

EXT. STREET— NOPPES (MLS) — NIGHT

NOPPES (CONT'D; V.O.)

(impulsively)
I'mjust not satisfied! Sure, it really makes me sick that I'm so dissatisfied,
‘cos Ijust can't stand myself sometimes, but at least I know why I'm
so dissatisfied: it'sjust not enough for me to go to work every day, to earn
money and then to try and be satisfied with that,
And then one day you find yourself running off every morning and getting
more worn—out, fatter and more dissatisfied, And that's why we play so
loud and fast and harsh, and not the Polka the Bird Dance or ‘Love me doo!‘
‘Wir wollen alle frohlich sein!‘ ‘I've been lookin' for freedom,,,' and all
that shit, I can't play that stuff, it's not my thing! I come to practice
with the feeling: This makes me wanna puke!
And now you finally wanna do what y o u want! And you know why you're so
dissatisfied: you don't wanna end up like everyone else! And that's why the
music sounds like that, that's why it's: Gimme a ‘G', gimme an ‘O', let's
GO GO G0!
The music has drive and is loud and is harsh, and eachjerk that hears
it grabs his head and yells, "No, no, no! That'sjust plain racket!‘I

And that's exactly what I want!
(confidently)

I really like my grandma, she's the most kind—hearted woman, but she hasn't
the faintest idea about it, When I play her some of our music, she just says,
”T h at doesn't sound very good! I don't know a thing about that,

now that is strange,,,'I Yeah, and that isjust the best compliment you‘ll ever

get for this music,

INT. SOUTH STATION KREFELD — LIVE CONCERT — NIGHT

B_LL_L_S_l

Every morning I wake up now I jump out of the bed

I run downstairs to check out what's landed in my post box
I hope it's a postcard or even a letter

Or maybe it's something else

I don't want even think about

The bills, they're driving me crazy
They're drivin' me insane
The bills, they‘re driving me crazy

But I've got to pay

I work and work each day and try and get it together
Now I've seldom time for my new woman

She getting mad with me

She doesn’t give a damn

She's going to go home now

But I've got to pay

Every evening I come home nowI fall into the bed

I turn on the TV—set then I get me a beer

I ring up the woman to see if she's there
Maybe she'll come around

And bring my head together

The bills, they‘re driving me crazy
They're drivin' me insane,,,

(Refrain until: ",,,to pay!")

INT. PRINTERY I — DAY

The drummer NOppes enters through a white-painted iron door and goes to the
offset montage table, He tears off some Scotch tape and pieces film together,

NOPPES (V.O.)

Yeah, offset montage,,,
Snipping film together at a light table,,, You stare all day into a neon tube,
fiddle around with film that's one millimetre thick and you always have to
think, to concentrate- of course, that doesn't work out too well with a hang—
over, huh?! It's still ‘in' to be able to say, ”I'm in the ‘graphics trade',,,'I

(He laughs)
Back then, back then it was really bad, we had a real bad—tempered boss and

a bunch of gutless idiots who put up with his rampaging without a word,

Ifyou came in in the morning looking a bit crumpled he'd say, "Where

have you been? Just climbed off the old lady, huh?‘I

A boss like that,,, Looked like a pimp and screamed at his employees,
demanded overtime but if you ever came half an hour late yourself, he'd
cut it out ofyour pay right away, Then one day, I said, ”I feel sick!‘I
But the boss didn't believe that I felt sick, So I went to the john and
drank a saturated salt solution — that was real dangerous, but I didn't
know that then! Then I drank some strong black tea, so strong, so black

that I could hardly get it down, And then it started: Barff, barff, barff!
NOppes runs his hand over the offset film,

Yeah, and then I ran real fast from the john to the boss's office and said,
”I'm sick!‘I ”You're always sick, Now get to work!‘I Hmmf Well, Ijust

threw up all over,

They start to repeat five times following lines:

INT. PRINTERY II — DAY

The drummer NOppes is standing at the offset montage table,

NOPPES (V.O.)
You have this stupidjob and get paid for it so you can buy yourself

NOppes goes into the room next door,

NOPPES (CONT'D; V.O.)
My neighbor, he might not go to the Colosseum any more, but he's got a Ford
Mustang out front, low — slung with leopard skin inside, CB radio and all
that shit, He thinks he's more civilized 'cos he doesn't have to

light a match now that he's got a cigarette lighter,

Others have got a, y' know, computer with the works, or a great, big, huge
stereo system, what other substitutes are there? Maybe buying clothes, yeah!
Well, whatever, I've always spent my money on booze, My head was always
buzzin‘ so bad when I came home from the sweatshop that I just wanted to
numb the pain, Yeah, back then I didn't really do much drumming, I didn't

get around to it! You can't be a bank clerk AN D a cool rock singer at the

same time — things have to be a bit different!

That's the main reason why I'm a drummer, so I don't get into a complete
rut, where I don't wanna be: work, earn money, spend money— earn money,
spend money, work— spend, Yeah, that's why I'm a musician, that's why
I'm a drummer, and that's why it's the most important thing! Of course,
that sort oflife is completely wild, there's no doubt about it, you become a

real pain in the ass, especially for yourself,,,

NOppes draws the curtain shut with one movement,

Meetin' you at private places
You never look at me

In my heart I feel so sad

It's such a tragedy

Is there too much dream of
An unreal sight ofyou

KAISER (V .0.)
Of course! That'd mean action, noise, crowds of people, all hell would

JOCHEN (V .0.)
Yeah, and they‘re all just small joints anyway, they'd have to risk laying
a couple a hundred marks on the table to let 'em play, and if they‘re un—

lucky, a couple of antisocial types turn up and rip thejoint apart!

NOPPES (V.O.)
Yeah, no—one does it any more: They'd rather open a Bistro, toss some
marble tables in there and let some yuppies drink their coffee: It's cooler
earning your money that way, and for show they stick a piano in the cor—

ner that's never been played!

ofthat, I still had green hair and was half naked: I said, "God
damn, doesn't anything I have to say mean a thing to you?
Besides, it just so happens that you can'tjust all march in

middle ofwinter, I stood around half naked out in front ofthe
police station: A taxi driver took me to the hospital, thank God,

where I had to stay the night:::

The result ofthe whole thing is that I got two years' probation
and a fat fine, ajuicy, fat ﬁne::: My probation is over, thank

God, that's a few years ago now, but I already had a record:

The faces of the other musicians appear next to Kaiser's, now Foxi's:

The cops here in Krefeld are totally cruel: You can't even go to

I don't know if you've ever seen those things, they're really bad,
they‘re these things that, y' know, sometimes they‘re used to
bundle cables together, know what I mean? They're things that
you pull through a loop and you can't get your hands out any

I used to sit around in front ofthe radio with my sister every
weekend, the WDR hit parade with Neil Sandock, and one
day they introduced some newcomers: "And now for some
new music from England called PUNK! The SEX PISTOLS
with ‘Holidays in the Sun!‘ And — M A N! They really
knocked me out, what music! So aggressive, yeah, I knew
for sure: ”Forget STATUS QUO, they‘re for the birds, make
way for the SEX PISTOLS!‘I

The song ”Anarchy in the UK'I by the SEX PISTOLS fades in:

Well, that was our first band, and we used to do classical punk
rock lyrics: a song against politicians, a song about getting drunk

and stuff like that, you know, just the classical stuff, see!

For example, HEXENTANZ, THE WITCHES' DANCE, was
about burning witches at the stake in the Middle Ages: See,
they were w o m e 11 who were outsiders who just weren't
tolerated by society: Basically, they were the first pharmacists!
Whatever, that's exactly how we saw ourselves in those days

too: societyjust can't stand anything that's different:

on a folding chair and opens a bottle: A bare light bulb hangs from a cable next

What went on here in Krefeld is hard to imagine: Incredible,

unbelievable, but true!

EXT. STREET — NIGHT

Foxi walks in the center of the street toward us as we track backwards:

FOXI (V .0.)
Around that time, say, November '86, a friend of mine turned
thirty and she threw a party at Brillo’sjoint: The cops came in
and, without any warning, started to take the speakers down and
carry them out: One woman asked, "What do you think you're

doin'? You‘re supposed to ask what's going on f1rst!‘I

Then the cop gave her a slap right across the face, so her boy—
friend went for the cop and the boyfriend was the first one out
cold that night: Yeah, of course, most ofthe people at the party
were pretty outraged and poured out onto the street where they
were met by the police backup: a fifty—man team with dogs:

Cops all over the place!

FOXI (MLS)
The next thing I knew, I was standing on the sidewalk and two
of them twisted my arm, threw me to the ground and started
kicking me and beating me with their billy clubs, real hard
from behind on my back and my head:

FOXI (CONT'D; V.O.)
Then they threw me in the paddy wagon with two other guys, one
ofthem was DIX and they'd completely smashed his nose: I had a
black bandanna which I gave to him: "C'mon, take it!‘I He was
bleeding real bad, and I mean B A D, I'd never seen anything like
that before! The blood wasjust pouring out of his nose, really,

just: gush, gush, gush!

FOXI (CONT'D; V.O.)
Then we both landed at the police station, and they ran through the
usual rigmarole: you have to take offyour shoes, you have to take
offyour belt, pull out your shoelaces and so on::: We both took off
our shoes and pulled out our shoelaces at the same time: We both
bent forward at the same time — DIX was still bleeding like hell —

FOXI (CONT'D; V.O.)
and what happens? A pig — not a police officer, a real pig! —
hauls off and slaps him one right smack on his broken nose, which
was totally smashed as it was! So DIX says to the medical officer,
"It's your duty to help me! You have to record the physical damage
that these police officer have done'I Then the cop goes up to him
and says, ”What? Your nose is broken? You claim your nose is
broken?‘I He goes up to him, grabs his nose with two fingers and
wiggles it around: "There's nothing broken:::'I I was sitting right

next to him and could hear the bones cracking!

Then they put us in a cell: I was in a cell with DIX and he was still
bleeding and yelling for the doctor too, and he said, "I have the right
to be treated, I'm bleeding, I'm injured!‘I Then they took him out of
the cell, punched him in the face again and stuck him in solitary:

That's how things went there:::

squad cars were sent to deal with the problem andascertainedthat:::
in some cases, extremely intoxicated punks were singing along loudly
and raucously to recorded music:
Anti—police sentiment became increasingly stronger: The officers were
insulted, threatened, pushed and one was even drenched with beer: An

attempt to lock the police officers in the apartment was unsuccessful:

The officers defended themselves with precise—aimed punches:::
Furthermore, the police was compelled to impound an amplifier in

order to carry out their task: The receipt for the system was kept for

BRILIO

Lookin‘ at the TV

Saw a horror—show once more

These old wise men from government
Have turned completely mad

They killed ten thousand people
With no weapons in their hands

And millions of people in the world

Are watching China's end

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

Oh well, we kill Sandinos

Sweet Maria lost her face

I’m feeling like a Rambo
And I play a video —game
Oh God, I wanna beg you

I don’t wanna die

I'm so fuckin' stupid

Just a Mac Donald’s guy

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

A brand—new killing—story

Is the TV—show tonight

We are sitting here in boredom
Cause we don't have to fight
See all these people dyin'

For they just want their rights
Forget about their cryin'

It's already half past five

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

Can anybody tell me

How long can this go on
Stupidity and ignorance

Let's send them to the moon
Don't need these politicians
They will always be the same
They're causing all the miseries

Let‘s go and let them tame

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

Ah, ah, I cannot stand it anymore

BRILLO (V.O.)

What is punk, after all? It's the music that interests me:

FOXI (V.O.)

Above all it's an outlet — for your own feelings: For me,
it balances out your humanity, it's absolutely necessary

Are so strongly in my head

I used to see them fading

KICKS

I'm lookin' for this

I'm lookin' for that

I'm crawling through the streets
like an alien cat

No idea and no mind in my head

I wanna get rid of it

I feel like a rat

Ah, ha, ha...

Kicks I really need them
For my brain is turnin' mad
Girl you can really give it to me

For my heart it feels so sad

There's fuckin' boredom

Isolation all around

All the people I'm tryin' to meet
Are lookin' to the ground

I don't want to hate you

But I don't know how to love
Kicks I really need them

'Cause the hell is there above

Kicks I really need them

For my brain is turnin' mad

Girl you can really give it to me
For my heart it feels so sad

There's nothin' left at all

Applause.

60

No meanings anymore

Many friends I used to know

Are lyin' on the floor

I don't want to hang around

Just waitin' 'till the end

Time goes on, doesn't wait for me

Just want to find a sense

I need kicks, kicks, kicks

I need kicks, kicks, kicks...

C L E A R U P

Feelin' alright to have won a fight
Against these monsters out of a bad dream
Clear up the sky, hear nobody cry

Wishin' to die, I already was dead
Hearin' a laughter, want to be tougher
Wakin' up, get out of a dream

Remember what you've done, I'll never forget
In the dark night I'm startin' to scream
(CHORUS)

Bang, bang, I could dream of

Livin' in another world

Bosh, bosh, I could beam me up

Never wanting to return

Forty feets higher, I heard a bird sing

A suddenly clear up, my brain had a ring

61
(BRILLO)
Leavin' the dark, new morning arrives
Shady grey turns blue, I'm startin' to dive
See only faces with coldest smiles
Want to be away a million of miles
Could it be true, I only felt blue
In the dark night, I'm startin' to scream
(CHORUS)
Bang, bang, I could dream of
Livin' in another world
Bosh, bosh, I could beam me up

Never wanting to return

I'm too realistic cause there's too much plastic
Have they forgot what was once in their hearts
Where have they gone, where are they from
TV—rules, nothin' left in their brains

I wanna start somethin' that's really new

Not with these zombies, we're only a few

And know exactly what's in our hearts

And we will rise and take our part

Clear up, clear up

Clear up, clear up

German Democratic Republic, drives towards us: The band van approaches

behind the "trabi”:

the jerk!

INT. REHEARSAL ROOM — CHAOTIC DREAM SCENE — NIGHT

Showing the inner fears, doubts and tension ofthe musicians prior to a gig in
the form ofa grotesque daydream: NOppes' hands are stuck together, Iochen
pulls the amp cable through his t—shirt like an autistic, on Brillo‘s mike stand

is an apple, Foxi plays on a broken guitar, Pat can't sing a note: Rapid cuts:
90—track sound collage: END OF CUT REEL: 9

The daydream scene in the rehearsal room ends with a smooth ﬂight to the

heard: ”The Instrumental": END OF FIRST NUMBER

EXT. STAGE — NIGHT

Pat climbs out the window and goes to the microphone: Pan to audience:

My name is Pat M:C: I am the voice

Iochen loves to make — a lot of noise
Kaiser plays the bass like a — sledgehammer
Foxi plays guitar in his — own manner

And Brillo is calling— who pays my next

drink? Cheers!

Nobody cares — about the yells

The earth is calling —we kill ourselves

We need nature — handle with care

But we treat her like shit — everywhere

Fucking mouth shut!

”Beam me up Scotty", beam me up to space

One day soon this world's a grave

PAT

Always when I wake up

With my clothes on in my bed

I try to reconstruct

The last night in my head

I had a little drink

And lost count after twenty

The tension in my soul says to me:

”It was in plenty'I

(CONTINUED: THIRD NUMBER)

PAT ON STAGE (MCU)

(PAT)

In different ways

I tried to pass it bye

I tried and tried and tried again
But it was always getting high
After these nights events

I know what’s best for me

But I know I won't resist it
The desire's still in me

To really piss me up

In great dissatisfaction

But I can't help myself

It's like a chain reaction

In different ways:::

I need to drink

Cause sober I'm to shy

But I hate to feel like this

And that's the reason why

All these sessions "Fuck me up'
And I know, it's true

Maybe now, I need someone

And maybe that’s you — now!

Lost count after twenty
Lost count after twenty

Lost count after twenty:::

The stories you are tellin'

Saw a fool thought he was a man

No real life nothin' to give

Every morning I wake up now
Ijump out ofthe bed
I run downstairs to check out
What's landed in my post box
I hope it's a postcard or even a letter
Or maybe it's something else

I don't want to even think about

The bills, they‘re driving me crazy
They're driving me insane
The bills, they‘re driving me crazy

But I've got to pay

I work and work each day

And try and get it together

Now I've seldom time for my new woman
She getting mad with me

She doesn’t give a damn

She's going to go home now

But I've got to pay

PAT & BRILLO
Everybody's got to pay

At the end of BILLS, the band beams itselfaway from the concert: SOUND
EFFECTS STARTING ROCKETS and RADIO COMMUNICATION from

the FIRST MANNED MOON LANDING: SOUNDS of GUITAR DELAY

at the end: The motifs sway and rotate: When the final chord and the sound
collage are heard, we see them

INT. SEWER — DAY.

The sounds of the concert and the rocket resounds as it dies away:
Dark noises of rain—water faintly gargles in the sewer:

EXT. PEDESTRIAN PRECINCT — NORMAL COLOR — DAY

People with shopping bags pass by behind the gap made by the half—open
manhole cover: The cover falls shut with a BANG: Darkness: Closing
music, growing louder: DINASAUR'S RACE:

Gradually painted hamburger packaging, sausages a bottle and brightly—colored
food items: Yellow roll—up titles appear over the still life by Rudi Loer:
