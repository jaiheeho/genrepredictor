EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD (NICOSIA, CYPRUS) — LATE AFTERNOON 14

FROM the sun we SLOWLY TILT DOWN INTO the courtyard, the
MOVE ENDING as an explosion of white doves, fluttering
into the air, revealing a Muslim wedding party, the
guests gathered around the bride and groom, both early
20s. The attendants are all well—dressed, affluent
Arabs, most in western attire.

SUBTITLES: NICOSIA, CYPRUS

Cautiously, the bride looks up, toward a balcony... Where
four men, strategically positioned, watch the proceedings
below. The men, all Arabs in casual western attire, are
focused not on the wedding party but the balconies and
windows around them. Deep in the shadows, a fifth man,
wearing dark glasses, is barely visible.

EXT. BALCONY — LATE AFTERNOON 15

The fifth man emerges, removing his dark glasses: the
terrorist ABD SA'UD JAFFA, a name synonymous with death.
of medium height, late 50s, he imparts an instant, chill—
ing presence: skin soft and paunchy, dark circles of
flesh beneath his eyes —— heartless, cold as ice, be—
speaking evil and treachery. As we study his face the
following SUBTITLES APPEAR:

Abd Sa'ud Jaffa, once the most
notorious and feared terrorist in
the world, now a desperate, hunted
man, his sanctuaries nearly
exhausted, betrayed by even his own
people.

CONTINUED: l5

Beside him is his chief of staff, ALI NAGI HASSAN, early
30s, a complex, highly—intelligent man, responsible for
Jaffa's security and middle man to outside organizations.
A man of considerable power but exercised only on behalf
and at the behest of Jaffa —— an man who never dictates
policy, only carrying it out. At the moment, he is
extremely anxious at this careless exposure of a man
carrying death warrants even from his own people. Ali
glances at his watch.

ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
Jaffa, we must go. We have stayed
too long. There are many on this
island who would betray you.

Jaffa turns, holding up his hand in a gesture of
restraint. He focuses on his beautiful daughter below,
radiant in this moment. He motions to her, indicating an
adjoining courtyard below. She excuses herself from the
party, Jaffa turning to descend a staircase. Ali is
upset by this recklessness but dogged in his determina—
tion to maintain security. He turns to one of the
guards.

ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
Check the street, then bring up
the cars.

EXT. COURTYARD — DAY 16

Elegant, a stone fountain as the centerpiece. Jaffa ex—
tends his hands to his daughter who complies, obediently,
she too in awe of this powerful, dangerous man, a man she
has rarely seen. Jaffa embraces her and then presses
something into her hand, a small gilded box. He speaks
softly to her.

Suddenly Ali is there. He nods differentially to the
daughter and then whispers anxiously to Jaffa.

ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
The plane cannot wait any longer.
We must go, please.

Jaffa bids a final farewell to his daughter and then
turns, nodding quickly to Ali.

JAFFA
(subtitles)
We go.

He replaces his glasses and ascends the stairs, Ali
quickly following, signalling to one of the guards at the
top of the stairs. Ali keys a tiny hand radio.

ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
Go.

INT. HOTEL — HALLWAY OF UPPER FLOOR — LATE AFTERNOON 16A

Jaffa, Ali and a bodyguard enter. Emerging from a room
are three men, one of whom is dressed identically to
Jaffa, his body type and face, very similar to Jaffa.
The double makes momentary eye contact with Jaffa and
Ali. Jaffa nods his approval. The man puts on dark
glasses and the decoy team heads rapidly down the hall.

INT. NICOSIA HOTEL — LOBBY — LATE AFTERNOON 16B
The decoy team descends the stairs, moving through the
lobby, few of the patrons or employees paying attention

to their presence.

EXT. NICOSIA HOTEL — LATE AFTERNOON 16C
Small but elegant. The decoy team leaves the hotel,
entering a waiting Mercedes sedan. The car pulls

smoothly away from the curb.

INT. MERCEDES SEDAN — LATE AFTERNOON 16D

One of the bodyguards looks out the rear window, the
hotel receding in the b.g. He keys his hand radio.

BODYGUARD

We're clear.
INT. HALLWAY — UPPER FLOOR — LATE AFTERNOON 16E

Ali lowers his RADIO, nodding to Jaffa who quickly
removes his necktie and replaces his business suit coat
with a sports jacket, a man always in hiding.

ALI

(subtitles)
I must phone the airfield. I will
be in the other car. Go with God.

Jaffa briefly touches Ali on the shoulder, a quick nod
from Ali and Jaffa leaves, escorted by three bodyguards.

EXT. NICOSIA HOTEL — LATE AFTERNOON 17

Now parked in the curved driveway is a Fiat sedan, a
driver behind the wheel.

Another car is parked in front of the Fiat, its driver
unloading baggage for an Orthodox Greek priest who stands
waiting on the sidewalk, eyes half—closed, feeling the
heat of the sun on his upturned face.

From the hotel lobby, two of Jaffa's guards emerge, one
standing lookout, the other walking quickly to the Fiat.
Looking cautiously about he leans into the driver, giving
instructions. The driver starts the car but before he
can back up, a taxi whips in behind, trapping it between
the two cars.

Three men, obviously drunk, stumble from the cab and
head for the lobby, arm—in—arm, talking loudly in German.

The terrorist beside the Fiat moves towards the cab,
shouting at the driver to back up. The taxi driver
emerges, shouting back at the terrorist. They meet at
the rear of the car, arguing. Suddenly the taxi driver
reaches to his back, whipping free a silenced .22 Beretta
automatic. In a flash, the gun is under the chin of the
bodyguard, a soft THUMP as the GUN is FIRED.

The driver lays the dead bodyguard in the street, swing—
ing out and around the car, leveling, FIRING TWICE, the
driver in the Fiat slumping down in the seat.

At the same moment, the three drunken men reach the lobby
doors, one of them pulling a silenced pistol, pressing it
into the lookout's stomach, FIRING. As he sits the dead
man into the base of a potted tree, the other two push
through the doors.

INT. LOBBY — DAY 18

As Jaffa and the remaining guard descend the stairs, a
BUSINESSMAN, seated at a couch folds a paper and picking
up a briefcase, follows in behind them.

The two boisterous drunks spill through the doors but as
they approach Jaffa and his bodyguard, pull their pistols
as the Businessman moves in from behind, shoving a pistol
into the bodyguard's back, a quick spin, another soft
THUMP and the bodyguard drops to the floor.

As the stunned patrons and employees look on, Jaffa is
moved quickly toward the doors, the Businessman speaking
into a lapel mike on his suit.

AGENT (BUSINESSMAN)
(in English)
We have number one. Move.

The three men push Jaffa out the door and down the
stairs.

EXT. HOTEL — DAY 19

A late—model MERCEDES SQUEALS INTO VIEW, the back door
flying open as more agents leap out. Jaffa is shoved
into the back seat.

Just then, Jaffa's backup car pulls around the corner and
into the driveway. The three terrorists inside realize
what is happening, the doors fling open, their weapons
drawn.

At this moment, the Greek priest, who has been backing
away in mock horror at the kidnapping, clears a MACH TEN
MACHINE GUN from his robes, his driver pulling a similar
weapon from the trunk. The two OPEN FIRE, the terrorists
in the backup car disappearing in a hail of EXPLODING
GLASS and ruptured metal. The priest and driver jump
into their car, pulling out.

As the MERCEDES PEELS OUT behind the priest's car, the
businessman leaps into the taxi, hiking out the window

and over the roof, FIRING several rounds into the tires
and radiator of the Fiat with a SILENCED PISTOL. A second
later, one of the priest's suitcases on the sidewalk
EXPLODES, a dense cloud of C.S. gas enveloping the area,
providing cover.

INT. HOTEL — UPPER BALCONY — DAY 20

Ali Hassan, hearing the faint but distinctive SILENCED
SHOTS, rushes from the room, a machine pistol in his
hand. Seeing the abduction below he leaps from the
balcony onto the roof, running across the tiles towards
the street.

He sights in on the Businessman, hiked out over the cab,
but stops short, seeing the silhouette of Jaffa, framed
in the back seat, too dangerous a shot for a machine gun.
Unwilling to risk hitting him, Ali throws out his arms,
screaming a cry of defiance and revenge, his eyes wild
with anger and hatred.

As the car whips its way through the narrow streets, we
hear the following VOICE OVER as we view the series of
news reports of terrorist activities including the bomb—
ing of a disco; aircraft wreckage; bombing of a military
hospital, etc:

EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY — DAY 21

A shimmering collage of heat—waves and OUT—OF—FOCUS
images.

SUBTITLES: ATHENS, GREECE —— 1 MONTH LATER.

Appearing mid—point in this silent, shimmering field,

a black dot slowly expands into an amorphous sphere, two
unattached, horizontal bands appearing on either side,
growing towards the center. Suspended in mid—air,
slowly drifting forward, the gigantic object resolves,
revealing a Boeing 747, the monarch of the air, descend—
ing directly towards us.

As if defying gravity, the mammoth airship seems sus—
pended as it settles towards the earth. The runway ap—
pears, the 747 FILLING the SCREEN as it passes silently
overhead... shattering the silence as three—quarters of
a million pounds of modern—age miracle return to earth:
an ear—splitting SCREAM and erupting smoke as tires
smash into the tarmac, followed by the THUDDING GROAN

of the suspension as it absorbs the awesome weight of
the plane. The 230 feet of hurtling mass ROARS down the
tarmac towards the terminal buildings in the b.g.

INT. PASSENGER TERMINAL — DAY 22

Where a variety of international travelers pass through
the security and X—ray control area, several traveling in
groups, their tour leaders dealing with last minute
problems and questions.

Among the passengers is a man, late 40s, European,
carrying a small, laptop computer which is being checked
by X—ray and a bomb analyzer, a device searching for the
scent of plastic explosives. Collecting his computer
from the inspection, he lights up a cigarette, looking
nervously about him as he does.

Behind him, a dark—complected MAN, late 20s, handsome,
Mediterranean, dressed in sporty, but expensive outdoor
clothing, is insisting that his two heavily—ladened
camera bags be hand inspected by the agent.

INT. BAGGAGE SORTING AREA — DAY 23

As baggage from the terminal is carried along conveyor
belts and loaded into aluminum baggage containers,
security men and dogs move against the flow, the dogs
eagerly sniffing for the tell—tale scent of drugs or
explosives.

INT. 747 CARGO COMPARTMENT — DAY 24

The food carts are rolled down floor tracks and into the
two lower galleys where the meals will be prepared. As
panels are lowered, isolating the galley from the rest

of the hold, the baggage containers are rolled and locked
into place.

EXT. 747 LOADING AREA — DAY 25

The massive fuel lines, pumping thousands of pounds of
kerosene into the airframe are pulled aside as mechanics
perform last minute checks on tires, landing gear and
engines, using ladders and lifts to gain access to the
belly and wings, ten feet above the ground.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN AREA — DAY 26

Where twelve flight attendants are being briefed by the
CHIEF STEW reading to them from a computer manifest.

Among the attendants is FRAN, 32. Aside from being physi—
cally striking, she possesses an easy, relaxed manner and
confident bearing.

CHIEF STEW
Our Captain today is Brad Stewart,
based in New York. We've got a full
load, 406 passengers. Also a
Federal air marshal, in 13—B and
he's carrying. Otherwise you know
your assignments so let's get ready
for pre—check.

The attendants move to their stations to prepare for the
long flight. GO WITH Fran and another attendant, JUDY,
28, black. By their smiles and animated conversation, we
understand they are close friends.

In a moment, the first of the 406 passengers begin filing
on board, looking for their seats, stowing their luggage,
assisted by the attendants.

The PHOTOJOURNALIST is having some difficulty placing
his two camera bags into the overhead. Fran appears.

FRAN
Sir, I can check those for you.

He turns, somewhat startled and then smiles. He is a
very handsome, exotic—looking man and the effect on Fran
is not unnoticed.

PHOTOJOURNALIST (MAN)
No, I'd feel more comfortable with
them here. They're quite valuable,
you see...

Fran smiles, moving to help place them in the overhead.

FRAN
Let me see what I can do.

With a little expert arranging, she slides the bags into
the compartment.

PHOTOJOURNALIST
Thank you...
FRAN
(smiling)

Fran. Have a nice flight.
She walks away towards the forward compartment.

An American family, husband and wife and two children,
boy and girl, take their seats. The children are seated
separately at window seats, tended to by their mother,
storing toys into the upper compartment, the kids, DAVID
and KAREN, playing with their latest Nintendo game.

A priest and two Greek orphans, boys, seven and eight,
take their seats in the center section, directly across
from the two American children. The children study each
other closely, the orphans dressed in shorts and knee
socks, the Americans in Reeboks, baggy pants and
T—shirts. The little girl seems totally mesmerized by
the two. She smiles warmly at them.

INT. MID—SECTION GALLEY AREA — DAY 27

Judy is putting on an apron. Fran appears, continuing
her conversation as she checks the area for supplies.
Fran nudges her playfully.

FRAN
So, how does it feel, now that
it's really happening?

JUDY
Can't get out of it now. He's
already paid for the hotel, the
church, and...

is, have you filed for that leave
of absence?

FRAN
Not yet. Still got the car to pay
off, helping my brother out, the
usual... I'll get around to it.

JUDY
Fran, you take care of everybody,
except yourself. When we get to
New York, you and me are havin' a
girl to girl. You've helped me
out of more shit than I can name.
Now it's pay back.

FRAN
(laughing)
Okay, we'll talk.

JUDY
You bet your sweet ass we will.
(opens elevator)
Meanwhile, back to the 'pit.'

Judy laughs, enters the elevator and descends from sight.

INT. MID—SECTION CABIN AREA — DAY 28

The man seen earlier with the computer, boards and takes
his seat. Moments later, a heavy—set WOMAN finds her
seat alongside him.

As she attempts to stow some of her luggage in the over—
head, several souvenirs slide from a bag, hitting the
small computer, resting on the man's lap. Startled, he
grabs the computer, looking up angrily at the Woman. He
then stows the machine beneath his seat.

WOMAN
(defensive)
Well I'm sorry. I didn't do it on
purpose.

The man ignores her, the woman, still mumbling, settles
uncomfortably into her seat, making sure to avoid any
further contact with him.

EXT. 747 TAXI AND TAKE—OFF SEQUENCE — DAY 29

The massive aircraft taxis into position and holds. We
hear the RADIO CHATTER between the cockpit and the con—
trol tower as final run—up tests are performed.

When the final clearance has been given, the ENGINES are
pushed to near red—line, the exhaust obscuring the run—
way in a shimmering wall of heat. Within two miles, the
plane is nearing 150 mph and beginning to lift as
millions of pounds of air are sucked into the SCREAMING
ENGINES. A moment later the plane clears the runway,
pulling magnificently into the sky.

INT. 747 COCKPIT — DAY 30

As the plane banks, turning into its outward course, we
hear the final course assignments and weather conditions
from the TOWER. A sense of calm settles over the cockpit,
the crew adjusting for the long flight.

INT. 747 FORWARD CABIN AREA — DAY 31

The "fasten seatbelt" sign winks off, the attendants and
passengers settling into their in—flight routines. Mo—
ments later a man leaves his seat and we follow his legs
as he walks down the aisle, stopping at a seat, the
Photojournalist casually looking up before returning to
his magazine. The man, wearing horn—rimmed glasses, hair
and mustache salt and pepper gray, skin slightly clay—
like, looks like a conservative businessman or professor.
He opens the overhead, removing one of the camera bags.
The man moves on, towards the mid—cabin bathrooms.

INT. BATHROOM — DAY 32

The grey—haired man stares into the mirror before remov—
ing his glasses, pulling free his wig, revealing black,
slicked—back hair. Using a towel he wipes the makeup
from his face, looking back at himself in the mirror:
Ali Hassan.

He removes from the camera bag two 6x7 reflex cameras.
Turning them over, he tears away the bases, an expertly
molded and painted section of plaster, revealing the
slides of two automatic pistols. He then removes two
camera pistol grips, pulling each away from its unit,
exposing firing pin and hammer mechanisms. He unscrews a
500mm mirror lens. Behind a dummy photo of the iris, are
secreted bullets in a long roll of lead foil. He contin—
ues to assemble the weapons...

INT. FORWARD CABIN AREA — DAY 33

Ali leaves the bathroom. He passes another Arab in the
aisle, handing him one of the weapons, secreted in a
magazine. This man walks to the front of the plane and
ascends the staircase.

At the same time, a third Arab leaves his seat, walking
to the forward galley area. He waits until the atten—
dant leaves her station and then slips into the elevator.

INT. LOWER FORWARD GALLEY AREA — DAY 34

The door to the elevator bursts open as the third terror—
ist storms into the galley, slamming Judy across the
chest, knocking her unconscious against the bulkhead,

her head striking the counter with a sickening THUD as
she falls.

The terrorist begins tearing into the food carts scat—
tering several of the trays to the floor. A moment later
he finds what he is looking for, several automatic
weapons and two grenades, hidden among the rows of food
trays.

INT. UPPER DECK — BUSINESS CLASS — COCKPIT AREA — DAY 35

The Terrorist approaches the cockpit door, an ATTENDANT,
working in business class seeing him.

ATTENDANT
Sir, the bathroom is to the right.

He nods. As she turns back to her work, the Terrorist
pulls from his pocket a small wedge of plastic explo—

sive with a fuse attached. Pressing the plastic into

the seam by the door latch and pulling the igniter, he
calmly steps back, revealing his handgun.

A sharp EXPLOSION blasts the door free from the lock.

As the startled passengers watch in shock, the Terrorist
rushes inside, brutally pistol—whipping the flight
engineer as he stands, then pressing the muzzle into

the pilot's neck.

Expertly the Terrorist reaches up, turning off several
overhead switches, and then turns to the navigator's
station, shutting down the radio and radar. He hands
the captain a sheet of paper.

TERRORIST
Your new course, Captain. Careful,
I am a pilot. No tricks.

INT. LOWER PASSENGER LEVEL — DAY 36

The passengers reacting in confusion to the sound of the
explosion. Ali walks past a U.S. Navy serviceman, now
starting to rise to his feet. Ali turns, FIRING TWICE,
point—blank into the man's chest, the high—caliber bul—
lets ripping through the seat, also killing a woman sit—
ting behind the sailor.

Behind him there is a CRASH. Ali spins, raising his
weapon, stopping as he sees an attendant, NANCY, backing
into the partition, holding her hands over her face, her
eyes wide with fear and horror. Ali studies her, calmly,
appraisinlgy and then dismissing her, hands the weapon to
Kahlil, the photojournalist. As if his point has been
made, Ali walks swiftly down the aisle, not bothering to
look at another passenger.

Somewhere in the main cabin, a hand gripping a .357
Magnum, partially removed from a belt holster, hesitates
before returning the revolver. Carefully, the man's

hand unsnaps the holster, sliding it and the gun down

to his feet where it is secreted in a dress boot, pants
leg covering it. Next his Federal I.D. wallet is slipped
between the seats.

A wave of fear rolls through the passengers as they con—
front the horrible reality —— hijacked. In a SERIES OF
SHOTS, we see passengers quickly hiding jewelry, watches,
Star of David medallions, passports, diamond rings.

INT. MID—SECTION WORK STATION — DAY 37

As a terrorist, shouting in Arabic, pushes Fran and
Nancy into the station, shoving them roughly into their
jump seats. As Fran sits, she looks up, seeing the
passenger manifest, hanging from the wall. Her eyes go
to a name: Edward Strickler, 13—B, United States Fed—
eral Air Marshal.

As the terrorist turns his back, she pulls the manifest
from the clipboard, slipping it into a trash receptacle.
She looks up, just as Ali steps into the space. He
removes his suit coat, hanging it over some work aprons
on the bulkhead. Lifting the intercom handset from the
wall, he speaks calmly, in perfect English.

ALI HASSAN
My name is 'Al Iqab.' In a few
hours we will return to London,
refuel and then travel to the
Middle East. You are to remain in
your seats and do as you are told.
Anyone disobeying my orders will
be shot.

Ali considers this a moment and then answers in English,
catching Fran's stare, looking into his cold, calculating
eyes as he does.

ALI
There is no need for that. Keep
them seated and maintain security.
I'm going to the cockpit.

He stares at Fran a moment and then turns away from

Kahlil, leaving the area, Fran seeing an expression of
confusion on Kahlil's face.

INT. LONDON RESTAURANT — DAY 42

Businessmen and ladies tailored in Saville Row fashions
wait patiently to be seated. A dark—complected man,

early 20s, wearing a shabby overcoat, pushes through the
patrons, past the MAITRE D' and into the main dining area,
oblivious to the indignant stares and murmured comments.
The Maitre d', offended at this incursion follows after
him.

MAITRE D'
(indignant)
Excuse me, sir, but may I help you?

The man reaches the center of the restaurant.

MAITRE D'
Do you have a reservation...

The man turns, the Maitre d' staring into the glazed eyes
of death. In that frozen moment, the Maitre d' notices
the man is sweating heavily, his breathing shallow.

The man slowly opens his coat, revealing a canvas vest to
which are taped a dozen blocks of plastic explosive,
fused and wired together in series. He holds out his
arm, revealing a detonator switch, crudely taped to his
palm, two wires running up his sleeve.

A frozen moment of hesitation and then the man, lifting

his face, eyes rolling upward, screams something in
Arabic and presses the detonator...

A fireball flashes through the atrium, a tidal wave of
flame and GLASS erupting into the street, followed by

the deafening THUNDERCLAP of the EXPLOSION.

A man dressed in gray sweats is running hard, pushing
himself down the hardpacked sand, sprinting the last
quarter mile.

SUBTITLES: VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA 5:30 AM

IN CLOSE we meet COLONEL AUSTIN TRAVIS, leader of an
elite special forces commando team, early 50s, graying
hair, still hard and lean, a man of incredible drive
and endurance.

Reaching a set of stairs he stops, checking his watch.
Satisfied he heads up the stairs ascending a grassy
bluff, taking the steps three at a time.

For what?

From the door LYNN TRAVIS, late 40's, athletic, short
bobbed hair, in tennis togs, appears.

LYNN TRAVIS
We've got doubles with Tom and
Karen at seven. Breakfast at the
club and then the house in Little
Creek, which you've been putting
off seeing for a week. Now get
in here.

She throws a towel at him. Overhead we hear the faint
THUMPING sound of a HELICOPTER passing by. Travis
listens, judging the distance and type of aircraft by
habit. He returns to Lynn, smiling.

TRAVIS
(teasing)
Hell, I thought that was tomorrow.
I already made plans to run into
D.C., drop by the Pent...

LYNN TRAVIS
Oh, no. As of 0:600 this morning,
you are on leave, mister, thirty
days, in preparation for
reassignment to staff headquarters.

Just where I want you, a nine to

next thirty days are going to be
devoted exclusively to me...

The sound of the HELICOPTER has increased. Through the
curtains Travis sees a blurred movement over the beach,
an army 500C helicopter feathering out, settling

to earth.

Lynn stares at the helicopter, face stricken, hands moving
defensively to her breast. An officer in camouflage
fatigues runs towards the house, a briefcase under his
arm. Travis turns, looking at Lynn, seeing once again the
look of betrayal, resignation, he has seen from her so
many times before. Unable to speak she breaks away,
entering the bathroom.

INT. PENTAGON — HALLWAY — NIGHT 48

Travis and his Staff Officer hurrying down the hallway,
Travis reading from a top secret briefing.

TRAVIS
Has Delta been alerted?

STAFF OFFICER
Yes, sir. Warning order in force,
they should be on the tarmac at
Fort Bragg by 0:800.

TRAVIS
Then let's go see what the hell
this is all about.

INT. ANTEROOM — NIGHT 49

Outside the Joint Chiefs Operations Center, where PETER
CAHILL, early forties, intellectual, slightly hyper, wear—
ing a crumpled corduroy suit and yesterday's shirt, is
gulping coffee from a large paper cup. He looks as if
roused from sleep, only minutes ago. A portable computer
rests at his feet.

Travis and his Staff Officer appear, Cahill looking up.
The two men stare at each other and then Cahill rises.

CAHILL
Colonel Travis?

Travis studies him, remembering. He nods.

TRAVIS
Cahill. The Jules Verne kid from
Advanced Projects Research. Two
years ago, right? That screwball
experimental airplane you were
trying to justify to the
Appropriations Committee. What
the hell was it called, 'Ramona?'

CAHILL
(quietly)
Ramora.

TRAVIS
Ramora. Right.

puzzled)
What the hell are you doing
here?

INT. PENTAGON — WAITING ROOM — NIGHT 49A

Spartan but tastefully furnished. In the center of the
room three men are conversing in hushed tones.

GENERAL MIKE SARLOW, head of ISA, the army's CIA, is
speaking while CAPTAIN DAVID GRANT, now dressed in an
army uniform, studies carefully the reactions of an
ARAB DIPLOMAT, late 50's, compassionate but penetrating
eyes, wearing an expensively tailored English suit.

SARLOW
There must be some way to contact
them. Someone he will listen to.

ARAB DIPLOMAT
(cautious)
Jaffa is a pariah to the Arab
community, a total threat to any
hope we have of peace in the
Middle East. No one will have
anything to do with him publicly.

SARLOW
I realize that, but we must try.

ARAB DIPLOMAT
I will do everything possible.
But there is no one politically
to deal with except Ali Hassan.
And he is a true believer. He
will be difficult to deal with.
A very dangerous man.

Sarlow looks at Grant for his assessment, receiving a
solemn nod of agreement.

INT. PENTAGON — ANTEROOM — NIGHT 49B

Some distance down the hallway, a door opens and Sarlow,
Grant and the Arab Diplomat emerge. Travis watches as
they briefly shake hands, the diplomat leaving, escorted
by a waiting Pentagon official. Sarlow and Grant turn
and walk towards the anteroom. As they approach, Travis
appraises them carefully just as the door to the
operations center swings open, a CIA OFFICER appearing.

CIA OFFICER
Gentlemen.

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER — NIGHT 50
The emergency operations center of the Joint Chiefs,
five stories underground, a huge oval—shaped room on

two levels.

(CONTINUED)

20.
CONTINUED: 50

The lower level is devoted to a massive communications
center, an intricate collection of telephones, computers,
and printers manned by military operators. On the walls
are a bank of television sets, flanked by huge screens
onto which maps, computer data and video images may be
projected.

The President's crisis—management team stands before one
of the overhead screens on which we see a map of Europe,
indicating the location of the 747, enroute to London.
Leading the team is GEORGE KAPLAN, the President's
National Security Advisor. With him is DIRECTOR NELSON,
head of the CIA (DCI); MAJOR ERWIN PRICE, and ADMIRAL
CHESTER LEWIS of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Along with
Sarlow, Travis and Grant, they listen to another tape
recording by Ali Hassan.

ALI HASSAN (V.O.)

(hard; clipped)
You have witnessed the conviction
of Al Iqab. My instructions will
be given once; no theater, no
negotiation. Jaffa will be taken
to Gatwick Airport, a long—range
private jet provided. With Jaffa's
release, Flight 343 will divert to
Washington, D.C. where half the
prisoners will be exchanged for
fuel and fifteen million in gold
bullion.

(beat)
Jaffa must be airborne by three
P.M., G.M.T., or a second, more
convincing message will be
delivered. All communication
will cease after this message.

Kaplan turns to Travis, studying him, carefully choosing
his words before he speaks.

KAPLAN
Colonel Travis, as you know, the
President is out of the country,
scheduled to meet with the Soviet
Premiere tomorrow. We're in
constant communication with him.
He's been apprised of everything
I am about to tell you.

Kaplan glances at Sarlow and Grant.

(CONTINUED)

KAPLAN
In the past hour, some new, rather
disturbing elements have surfaced,
possibly calling for some
extraordinary measures. That's
why you're here.

Travis looks around at the sober faces staring at him.
He seems to be the center of attention —— as if he's
the last to be brought in on something. He turns
back to Kaplan.

KAPLAN

The immediate situation is this.
The Prime Minister is demanding
Jaffa's release or he'll take
action on his own. We're going
to comply, to gain some time, at
least.

(to Sarlow)
General Sarlow?

GENERAL SARLOW

A number of Arab factions are
willing to attempt negotiations
with Jaffa's group, but unless
the highjackers elect to make
contact, our options are
severely limited.

(looks at Grant)
I'm going to ask Captain Grant to
continue. He's the best expert
we have on Arab terrorists, and
he's been on the highjacking since
we first learned of it.

Grant addresses the group but focuses on Travis, again
as if this is for his benefit. Grant refers to a

series of

documents taken from his briefcase.

GRANT
Based upon a voice print, I'm
certain 'Al Iqab' is Ali Hassan,
Jaffa's second in command. For
such a high—ranking member to
actually be in charge is highly
unusual.

He pauses, Travis cautiously acknowledging.

TRAVIS
Yes, highly unusual.

(CONTINUED)

50

22.

CONTINUED: (3) 50

GRANT
Then I'm sure you would also agree,
Colonel, that taking hostages to
spring Jaffa makes sense, but not
coming here. They can secure his
release and never leave Europe.

Again, Travis stares coolly at Grant.

TRAVIS
Obviously Hassan is up to something.

GRANT

Jaffa knew his effectiveness as a
terrorist was over and was in the
process of portraying himself a
moderate, another Arafat. But Ali
has always represented the hard
line, fundamental position.

(beat)
Rather then take a Mossad bullet in
the head he would rather go out
striking a blow at the Great Satan.
The Sword of God's Will.

(beat)
His nom de guerre, 'Al Iqab,' is
deeply rooted in Arabic culture,
associated with suicidal vengeance.
It means: "The Punishment.'

TRAVIS
So, what's the punch line?

Grant refers to an open folder before him.

GRANT
Less than a week ago, a small
Russian army convoy was ambushed
outside of Ashkhabad, near the
Iranian border. Ten men were
killed, a truck hijacked.

He places several satellite photographs on the table,
showing the burned wreckage of several Jeeps and soldiers
lying on the road.

GRANT
Recent intelligence gives us strong
reason to believe Jaffa's group
was responsible.
(beat)
The cargo of that truck consisted
of 42 canisters of DZ—5, being
relocated to a secret storage
facility.
(CONTINUED)

50

23.
CONTINUED: (4) 50
Travis stiffens slightly at the mention of the word.

GRANT
DZ—5 is the latest generation of a
biogenic nerve toxin, far more
lethal than any chemical weapon
we've ever seen...

He places several photographs on the table showing Middle
Eastern tribesmen and soldiers, lying in contorted and
misshapen heaps; one photograph showing a Kurdish tribes—
woman clutching a baby, their faces frozen masks of
agony, gasping for their last breath of life.

TRAVIS
(sober)
I'm aware of its capabilities,
Captain.

Grant stops, his briefing finished for the moment.
He looks to Director Nelson, the DCI, who picks up
a computer printout.

DCI

A cross—check of the passenger
and cargo manifests, Colonel,
indicates a shipment of 'art
objects,' leaded pottery, 250
kilos in weight, on board
Flight 343...

(beat)
The point of origin, final
destination and the person assigned
to that shipment are all non—
existent.

Kaplan now resumes, but Travis clearly understands
the situation, Grant carefully studying his reaction.

KAPLAN
We have to consider, Colonel
Travis, the strong possibility that
gaining the release of Jaffa is
only the first phase of a larger
plan...

TRAVIS
(grave)
A major strike against the U.S.

Again Grant speaks up, referring to his notes. He is
obviously well prepared for this briefing.

(CONTINUED)

thru

24.

CONTINUED: (5) 50

GRANT
Assuming only 10 canisters,
airburst over Washington... we
could expect between 50,000 to
100,000 deaths. Anything inside
a hundred miles of the coastline
would be disastrous.

A frozen moment and then Kaplan looks directly at

Travis.

KAPLAN
(gravely)
Meaning, Colonel Travis, if this
scenario is true, the President
would have no other choice but to
order the plane destroyed.

TRAVIS
(confused)
Yes, sir, no other choice. But I'm
at a loss, Mr. Kaplan. If this
is all true, where does my team fit
in?

Kaplan glances at Grant, then to the DCI.

KAPLAN
Because, we've been told we may
have another option, Colonel.
Which does concern you.
(to Nelson)
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

Nelson nods to one of his aides who leaves the room.

OMITTED

DCI
It's a wild card, Colonel, but
under the circumstances, it's all
we've got. You've already met, I
think, Peter Cahill, an
aeronautical engineer at DARPA, a
pioneer in stealth technology...

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER — DAY 54

CLOSE ON a video screen where a computerized blueprint is
displayed, a drawing of a double—walled, ovoid cylinder,
at the top of which is an inner and outer o—ring device:
a series of circular, sucker—like cups, attached to a
collection of pneumatic pumps.

The image changes, an engineer's drawing, showing the
cylinder, similar to a submarine's conning tower,
attached to the top of a radically designed executive—
style jet with stealth characteristics, featuring
swept—back wings and a horizontal, rather than vertical,
tail.

Another drawing shows the cylinder telescoped upward,
several times its original size, the delivery plane now
positioned beneath and mated with an aircraft many times
its size, a giant XB—70 bomber.

Suddenly Travis gets the picture, understanding where he
fits into the loop.

TRAVIS
Jesus H. Christ...

All eyes are on Travis.

TRAVIS

Excuse me, Mr. Kaplan, but I see
where you're going with this. My
team is thoroughly versed in
carrying out assaults on hijacked
aircraft. But on the ground, not
five miles above the earth.

(beat)
I informed Mr. Cahill two years
ago that we had little use for
this 'aircraft' in Special Ops.
This thing was designed to
transfer flight crews to and from
strategic bombers, requiring
special adaptation to the aircraft.

(looks at Cahill)
Its application with a civilian
aircraft was dismissed as posing
too great a risk to the
passengers. A hijacked aircraft
eventually has to land somehwere
where we can deal with it...

Travis realizes the irony of his last statement, even
before Kaplan speaks up.

(CONTINUED)

54

26.
CONTINUED: 54

KAPLAN

This does appear to be the
exception to the rule.

(beat)
We said this was a wild card,
Colonel. But if your team can
board that airplane, determine if
there is a bomb and take control
of the situation, we at least have
a fighting chance. Otherwise,
four hundred and six passengers
will have to be sacrificed.

(sober; intense)
The President does not want to
shoot down that plane, Colonel...

but he will. He cannot risk
50,000 American lives.
(beat)

In his words this is a Hail Mary
pass. He has no other options.

Kaplan continues to look at Travis.

TRAVIS
How much time?

Grant speaks up.

GRANT
You have to be airborne within the
hour.

Travis thinks a moment and then nods, the soldier's
acceptance of duty. He looks at Cahill.

TRAVIS
One question. You have enough
confidence in this gadget to stake
your life on it, under these

circumstances?

CAHILL
It's been modified... the pump's
much stronger... Even without the

mating collar there is an
appropriate hatch on the 747 and
the wide surface area of the
aircraft should be sufficient for
a link—up...

(beat)
I'd have to say I have extreme
confidence in its application,
even under the less than optimum
circumstances.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2) 54

TRAVIS
Well, good. Because I want you to
go along. I don't want anything
left to chance.

Cahill is stunned. He starts to speak but a withering
look from the DCI shuts him up. Cahill looks sick.
Kaplan speaks up, dealing his last card.

KAPLAN
I think one addition to the team
is called for, Colonel. An expert
in Arabic dialects, someone who
has made a careful study of Ali's
life, who knows how he thinks, how
he operates...

Travis turns and looks at Grant, their eyes locking.
This was unanticipated by Grant and his face shows it.
The Major—General, Travis's boss speaks up.

MAJOR—GENERAL
I see absolutely no need for
Captain Grant's involvement in the
actual operation. He can
accomplish an advisory role right
from here in Operations.

KAPLAN
On the contrary, General, I think
his actual presence could prove
crucial. Captain Grant might be
able to forecast something Ali is
going to do, before he does it.

MAJOR—GENERAL
Mr. Kaplan, it's going to be
difficult enough for the Colonel
and his men...

Travis speaks out.

TRAVIS
Excuse me, General. I'll take
him. He could prove useful.

He fixes Grant with a look that says, "Okay, let's see
how you handle the real thing."

and military aircraft.

Travis's Special Forces driver is at the wheel, Travis
in the front seat, Grant in the rear. Grant, windblown
and chilled, seems uncomfortable and nervous, a marked
change from his confident bearing at the Pentagon.
Travis turns in his seat.

TRAVIS
Curious why I didn't vote against
your coming, Captain?

Grant is curious but remains silent.

TRAVIS
Because this whole operation was
your idea, wasn't it? Your little
brainstorm.

The look on Grant's face says it all.

GRANT
That's what I get paid for,
Colonel.

TRAVIS

And my boys get paid for putting
it on the line. I'm not faulting
your ideas, Captain. Like Kaplan
said, under the circumstances it's
a brilliant plan. And crazy
enough that it just might work.

(beat)
Except we know we shouldn't be
doing it in the first place, don't
we?

GRANT
(uncomfortable)
I'm not sure I follow you, sir.

TRAVIS
Then I'll enlighten you. Where
you intel boys fucked up was
cooking up this hare—brained
scheme to put Jaffa on trial in
the first place.

GRANT
You're mistaken, Colonel. We had
nothing to do with Jaffa's
abduction...

(CONTINUED)

29.
CONTINUED: (2) 54A

TRAVIS
Oh, horse shit. I know a hell of
a lot more about what goes on in
your world than you think. It was
a C.I.A. op, an executive decision
from the beginning. We both play
for the same team, Captain. The
only difference is, you don't have
to pull the trigger.

GRANT
I had no involvement with that
operation, Colonel.

(beat)

But I agree with it in principle.
Jafa is an international criminal
and had to be brought to justice.
Men like that have to know they're
not beyond the reach of the law.

TRAVIS
Law? The only law animals like
Jaffa and Ali understand comes
from the end of a gun.
(beat)
You should have killed them all
when you had the chance.

Grant reflects on this.

GRANT
Well, that's all a moot point,
isn't it? No matter what, Jaffa
is home free.

A cold look from Travis.

TRAVIS
Don't count on it, Captain.

The Jeep pulls to a halt beside a massive hangar, just as
a CH—46 HELICOPTER ROARS INTO VIEW over the top, quickly
settling to the tarmac, Travis and Grant turning to avoid
the prop wash.

Emerging from the helicopter are seven men, wearing watch
caps, dark green pullovers, black cargo—pocketed pants,
and light weight, crepe—soled boots. Quickly they unload
dark duffel bags and ABS plastic suitcases.

Travis swings from the Jeep, leaving Grant behind, making
his way to the team. They cluster momentarily, Travis
warmly greeting them.

CONTINUED: (3) 54A

Grant sees a very close—knit, highly motivated and
bonded team, but he sees as well the fear in their eyes,
the adrenaline rush, and as they glance towards him, the
automatic distrust of outsiders.

TRAVIS
(shouting)
Outstanding, gentlemen. Any
problems?

One of the men, BAKER, good—natured, wide beaming face
speaks up.

BAKER
(shouting)
Almost missed Cappy. Caught him
in his driveway, pole in his hand,
headed for the Keys.

Travis looks across at CAPPY, 48, black, lean, chiseled,
intelligent features, wearing in contrast to the others a
black insulated jumpsuit, covered with dozens of pockets
and pouches. On his head is a floppy fatigue hat, several
trout flies in the brim.

CAPPY
(shouting)
Damn near made it, too.

Several of the men look up, seeing Grant as he
approaches. Travis turns, looking at Grant.

TRAVIS
Boys, this is Captain Grant, I.S.A.
He's along in case we get into any
serious trouble. Let's go. We'll
brief in flight.

The men pick up their gear, walking towards the hangar.
Another of the men, a wiry, intense Chicano, nicknamed
"RAT" for his expertise in surreptitious entry, looks
around him, searching for something.

RAT
Colonel, I don't see the support
van. Are we takin' it?

TRAVIS
Not this time, Rat. We're
traveling light.

The huge doors begin to part...

INT. HANGAR (AIR FORCE BASE) — DAY 55

As the DOORS RUMBLE open, the men walk forward, casting
long backlit shadows before them as they step through the
hangar doors.

They stop, staring at something inside the cavernous hangar.

BAKER
What the hell is that?

CHARLIE
(pilot's drawl)
Well, it ain't made the cover of
Popular Mechanics.

REVERSE ANGLE 55A

we see a hawk—like aircraft of black, anodized titanium,
so rakish and streamlined it looks almost in flight just
sitting on the ground. A flight crew, finishing last
minute services and checks on the high—tech bird, remove
their service equipment, the pilots entering the craft.

As the team approaches the plane, Cahill appears from
inside. He calls out to Travis, gesturing towards the men.

CAHILL
(shouting)
Too much weight! Never designed for
this many —— never get off the ground!

(beat)
And we're running late. For every
minute we're here, we have to make
up ten in the air. Got to go!

Travis turns to the men, pointing to the equipment.

TRAVIS
(shouting)
Cut it down! Close—quarter
weapons, bomb kit, detection and
surveillance gear, and the sleep
agent. Dump the rest! Let's go!

Immediately the team begins digging through the equip—
ment, taking only the essential items, leaving the rest
on the hangar floor. As Travis and Grant stand next to
each other, Travis's Driver appears.

DRIVER
Sir, I have your call to S.A.S
command in London. 'Cousin Reggie'

is on the scrambler.

Grant seems very curious as Travis takes the call on a
SAT—COM briefcase unit, but Travis's words are drowned

INT. MILITARY BASE (ENGLAND) — PRISON CELL — DAY 57A

Where in the dim light of the cold cell, Jaffa sits on
his bunk, dressed in gray overalls. Suddenly the heavy
steel door swings open and several American MPs enter,
pulling Jaffa to his feet, putting him in handcuffs. As
the startled Jaffa is led from his cell, he sees an
American diplomat, staring at him coldly from the
hallway. As he's ushered down the hall, Jaffa realizes
something significant has taken place.

EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE (NEAR LONDON) — DAY 58

A convoy of U.S. and British military vehicles flies
past on a country highway, the access roads blocked by
military police. A sign reading: "LONDON 150km" is
seen in the f.g.

In the third vehicle from the lead, Jaffa sits in an
armored Range Rover, surrounded by soldiers, the diplo—
mat seated beside him.

INT. DELIVERY PLANE — DAY 59

We PULL BACK to reveal the interior, spartan but func—
tional. Fold—down jump seats accommodate the team, the
rear of the jet devoted to racks of miniaturized elec—
tronic and navigational gear. The predominant feature
of the jet, however, is the dome—like appendage swelling
from the ceiling near the cockpit. A pressurized hatch
is located in the center of the dome, surrounded by a
series of gauges, levers and switches.

The ship is intermittently buffeted by turbulence,
obviously not the best of flying conditions. The men
are intense and highly focused as they listen to
Travis' briefing of the bizarre mission they are about
to undertake. Grant is obviously the outsider, sitting
near the rear of the aircraft.

TRAVIS
The stakes are high on this one,
gentlemen, the most important
mission we've ever been handed.
This assault is untested and
carries more than the usual element
of chance, but under the
circumstances, it's the only chance
those people on board have.

A quick look to Grant, then to Cahill.

TRAVIS
Otherwise, it's a standard
suppression op, just as if we had
boarded on the ground.

All right, let's go through it.
Baker.

Baker turns to a video screen, part of a portable high—
tech communication and tracking system. He plots a
simulated course, showing an intercept point of the 747
and the delivery plane over the Atlantic.

BAKER

The 747's transponder and radar
is off, but the E2 now has a fix
on them. Our intercept should be
about here, roughly an hour out of
London.

(beat)
That gives us four hours on board
before she reaches the hundred
mile limit.

TRAVIS
Give me that schematic.

Baker snaps an exploded—view cell, showing the 747 in
intricate detail, into a light box. The team studies
the glowing, back—lit schematic.

TRAVIS
Grant, you're up after Baker, find
a hole and sit tight while Baker
sets up the intercom link with the
Pentagon. Sleep—agent is next.

In the tests of S.C.H. I've been
briefed on, the effects on most
subjects was a gradual drowsiness
for about thirty seconds before
unconsciousness.

TRAVIS
(curious)
Correct. What's your point?

GRANT
Thirty seconds may be too long.
Ali is highly intelligent, acts
instinctually, by nature suspicious
of everything. The slightest
indication his mission has been
comprised could result in a
disastrous reaction on his part.

Travis considers this.

TRAVIS
Good point. Baker?

BAKER
I can increase the saturation.
It'll put 'em out instantly but
it's pretty risky. We could lose
someone before we cycle the gas
out.

Travis looks at Grant.

TRAVIS
Increase it. We'll take the chance.

Anxious faces look up and then the team returns to
packing and preparing equipment.

Travis, near the cockpit, is busily typing on a satellite
transceiver unit, a high—tech computer phone unit, housed
inside a black aluminum case. He enters a command and a

small plastic strip, a magnetic code key, emerges from a

slot. He closes the case, motioning for Grant.

TRAVIS
You'll run the intel—board, mikes,
microwave scanners and video
probes. Things run to plan,
you're just along for the ride.

He gives Grant the mag—key, matter of factly.

TRAVIS
Hang on to this. Access key for a
scrambled transmission I'm
expecting. Little arrangement with
Cousin Reggie in England. You'll
need this to patch me through.
Code name is 'Executive Decision.'

Grant nods, putting the code—key deep inside his shirt
pocket. Travis looks at him, studying him. He grins.

TRAVIS

By the way, good call on the sleep
agent.

You're the expert on Ali. Tell me,
aside from freeing Jaffa and
killing a lot of innocent Americans,
what does he hope to gain from all
this?

nuclear, that a Pan—Arabic war
would result, the focus at the only
plausible target in the region,
Israel.

power in the region as well. Very
clever.

GRANT
Inspiration born of desperation.

TRAVIS
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

They look at each other, a new level of respect for their
situation passing between them.

EXT. 747 — DAY 60
The huge plane moves majestically onward on its course
across the Atlantic.

INT. 747 CABIN AREA — DAY 61
Silent as a tomb. Terrorists armed with automatic

weapons are stationed at various locations on the plane.
All of the window shades have been pulled down.

A terrorist armed with an automatic weapon, pistol and
grenade, moves slowly down the long corridor, his eyes
glaring at the passengers, who sit terrified, unable to

move or speak.

He passes the mid—cabin area where Ali Hassan and two
others have set up a monitoring station, adapted to the
plane's gutted telephone system, consisting of a SHORT—
WAVE RADIO, over which can be heard a NEWS BROADCAST,
and alongside it, a military field radio.

As the guard nears the front of the plane, he walks
past a terrorist, dragging the two murdered passengers,
now covered in blood—stained blankets, into one of the
forward bathrooms.

We FOCUS ON the PARENTS of Karen and DAVID, whispering
to each other in urgent voices.

WIFE
I want them here, with us.

HUSBAND
No. They're insane. They've
already killed two people. We're
going to sit here...

WIFE
And do what?

The terrorist guard passes by them, then past Karen and
David. As he does, Karen looks across at the two Greek
boys, silent, terrified, the priest beside them deep in
prayer, eyes closed, prayer beads moving through his
fingers. One of the boys notices her, staring back at
her with frightened eyes. Suddenly, on impulse, Karen
stands, moving into the aisle. Her brother reacts,
startled.

DAVID
(under his breath)
Karen! What are you doing! Get
back here!

But Karen stands in the aisle, holding out to the Greek
boy a Nintendo game, the boy remaining frozen, staring
at her.

Two rows back, Karen's mother looks up, seeing Karen in
the aisle, starts to rise when her husband's hand comes
down firmly on her arm.

HUSBAND
(stern whisper)
No! Don't move.

Slowly they lean out, trying to get Karen's attention
without alerting the guard.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2) 61

As Karen holds out the game, the Greek boy reaches out

to accept it... A gun barrel flashes INTO VIEW, the game
snatched from her hand. Terrified faces freeze in place,
priest, children, parents, passengers, as the terrorist
guard stares at the game. Angrily he shoves Karen aside,
shouting at her in Arabic. As Karen begins to cry, her
father, unable to restrain himself, lunges from his chair.

FATHER
You son of a...

The terrorist spins, slamming the butt of his rifle into
the father's chest, driving him back into his seat.
Instantly the barrel of the rifle is pressed hard into
his windpipe, cutting off his air, the father beginning
to choke. His wife reaches out, desperately, pleading...

WIFE
Please, you're choking him...
Please stop it!

But the terrorist presses harder, an angry sneer across
his face, a very ugly situation about to get worse...
Suddenly a hand reaches out, grasping the gun barrel.
Startled the terrorist looks up into Ali's face. Ali
pulls the gun away, carefully backing the guard into the
aisle, speaking softly to him in Arabic. The terrorist
settles but glares back in anger at the father.

Ali kneels to the floor, picking up the game. He
examines it and then hands it to the Greek boy.

He helps Karen into her seat, speaking to her in English.

ALI
You must stay in your seat.

He gently roughs her hair, looking up into the frozen
faces of her parents, and then into the faces of a

dozen other passengers, all staring at him, humbled with
fear. As Ali looks from face to face he sees, perhaps
for the first time, the people, the human souls, who are
destined to die with him in his desperate statement to
the West. He grows agitated and then speaks out, almost
as a parent to a child explaining why the child must be
punished.

ALI
I am not your enemy.
(beat)
You have been betrayed by your own
leaders... The supporters and

instigators of the Zionist occupation
of my homeland.

He stares into the frozen faces, paralyzed in fear.
He relaxes, smiles slightly.

ALI
But you have nothing to fear. God's
mercy is bestowed upon the innocent
and the righteous.

With a last look he turns and moves down the aisle.

INT. FORWARD GALLEY AREA — DAY 62

Fran, Nancy and two other attendants, sit in their jump
seats. Fran warily eyes the terrorist as he passes by,
the others averting him altogether. Fran turns to Nancy,
sitting next to her, obviously still deeply shaken by the
murders she witnessed earlier.

FRAN
(whispering)
Judy's been down there for four
hours. They wouldn't have left
her there alone. Something's
wrong.

NANCY
(whispering; terrified)
Oh God, Fran, be quiet. They're
crazy...

Sensing someone's presence, Nancy looks up, the words
freezing in her throat as she looks into Ali's face.

ALI HASSAN

You will bring food for my men.
Now.

Nancy, frozen with panic, closes her eyes, unable to
move or speak. Ali leans in closer.

ALI
I said, bring food for my men...

But then Ali looks up, seeing the empty clipboard that
once held the passenger manifest.

(CONTINUED)

He removes the clipboard, studying it, Fran's eyes
momentarily going to the trash bin where she hid the
manifest.

ALI
(to Nancy)
The passenger manifest. Where is
it?

Startled, Nancy looks up. She has no idea where it is.
Ali leans in closer, his face inches from Nancy, now
trembling in fear.

ALI
(menacing)

I will not ask you again. Where
is the manifest?

Fran's voince breaks the tension.

FRAN (O.S.)
I destroyed it.

Ali stands back, scrutinizing Fran.

ALI
(bemused)
Destroyed. How?

FRAN
The toilet...

ALI
I see. And why?

Fran hesitates a moment.

FRAN
To protect the passengers.

ALI
(smiles)
To protect the Jews.

He moves closer, scrutinizing her, his eyes deeply
penetrating hers.

ALI
(quietly)
Or, someone else...

Fran is terrified out of her wits but holds her ground.
Slowly, Ali backs away, eyes still probing her for the
slightest betrayal.

Brave, but a very stupid, foolish
thing to do.

And totally unnecessary.

He replaces the clipboard. He gestures to Fran.

ALI
You will bring food for my men.

FRAN
(calmly)
What about the passengers? They've
had nothing to eat or drink...

ALI HASSAN

(smiles)
No food, only drink.

(beat)
And, they may use the rear bathrooms,
accompanied by a guard. Any
suspicious movement, they will be
shot.

(beat)
See, I am a generous man. You are
free to move about the cabin. But,
no more mistakes. Understood?

FRAN
(softly)
Yes. Thank you. I'll have to use
the elevator.

Carefully she turns and opens the elevator door. As she
steps inside, Ali stops her, motioning for one of the
terrorist guards to accompany her.

ALI
No more mistakes.

INT. 747 LOWER GALLEY — DAY 63

The elevator door opens and Fran emerges, followed by
the guard. Immediately her eyes go to the limp form
of Judy, lying against the food carts. She starts to
move to her side, but the guard stops her with the
barrel of his weapon. Slowly she pushes it aside.

FRAN
(quietly weeping)
Do what you want, I'm going to
cover her body.

She turns away from him, taking a blanket from an
overhead storage compartment. She kneels, a last look at
her friend before covering the body. As she stands and
turns toward the food carts we see that her eyes, filled
with tears, also blaze with anger and hatred.

INT. DELIVERY PLANE — DAY 64

Rat attaches a pressure valve to a small stainless steel
cylinder, labeled: "GAS AGENT: SODIUM CHLORAL—HYDRATE."
He re—locks the valve, replacing the cylinder into a
circular, foam—filled nylon carrying case.

Beside him, Charlie opens an aluminum case, marked with
a wide red stripe. Enmeshed in foam is an array of
highly specialized weapons: a four—shot, high—powered
taser unit, equipped with Teflon barbs; lethal—looking
hand shotguns mounted on heavy pistol grips; a short—
barreled impact cannon with several rubber—tipped shells.

Cahill, studying the team, turns to Travis, eyeing the
.22 Beretta automatic strapped to his chest.

CAHILL
Why all the guns?

TRAVIS
Hope for the best, plan for the
worst, Cahill.

RAT
Don't sweat it, they're all
high—impact, close—quarter
weapons.

A warning light flashes on, announced by a BUZZER. The
pilot's voice is heard.

PILOT (V.O.)
Target acquisition, twenty—five
miles and closing. Initiating
approach system. Stand by.

The men quickly stow their equipment, putting on their
closed—circuit communications units, consisting of
headsets and microphones. Cahill nervously motions to
Travis, and Grant to approach the cockpit.

CAHILL
Once the tunnel is pressurized,
I'll open the hatch to the 747.
When you're inside, I'll go back
up and lock it.

(CONTINUED)

44.
64 CONTINUED: 64
Travis interrupts.

TRAVIS
As soon as the hatch to the 747 is
open, an alarm will activate in the
cockpit. We have to lock off that
switch within seconds or run the
risk of being discovered. Just
explain the procedure to Baker...

CAHILL
(adamant)

You don't understand. Opening the
final hatch is complicated, every
phase critical. I can't just tell
someone how to do it. Unless I

can ascertain that the seal is at
the proper vacuum, you may not have
any mission left to accomplish.

Travis considers this, Grant carefully studying him.

TRAVIS
Okay, Cahill. You make your
inspection and open the hatches.
But Baker is going to be right
there behind you. As soon as the
747 is open, you haul ass inside
so Baker can lock off that switch.

CAHILL
But...

TRAVIS
Then, when we're on board, you can
climb back down and close the
hatch.

Cahill is obviously not pleased with the idea of going on
board the 747, even for a few minutes, but Travis has the
final word.

CAHILL

(hesitant)
All right, but while the pressure
locks are open, both planes are
vulnerable to explosive
decompression. Move fast. This
was designed to be carried out
with both planes on automatic
pilot.

TRAVIS
Add it to the list.

They move forward into the cockpit.

INT. COCKPIT DELIVERY PLANE — DAY 65

Through the windshield can be seen the 747 as the
delivery plane approaches from the rear.

The CO—PILOT pulls down a transparent screen, covering
the mid—section of the windshield. He activates an
infra—red viewing field, revealing the wind—foil patterns
flowing over the wings and along the body of the 747,
leaving streaming contrails in its wake, the engines
glowing red—black.

CAHILL
An infra—red imaging device. The
air flow of heated molecular
particles, surrounding the plane.

Suddenly the plane pitches and rocks, encountering a
pattern of turbulence as they enter the wake of the 747.
Moments later, as if through parting clouds, we see a
channel appear, a clear spot underneath the belly of the
plane.

CAHILL
There, the 'sweet—spot.' A valley
of dead air, like the eye of a

hurricane.
They stare in awe as the tiny plane is slowly engulfed
by the huge mass of the 747 above it.
EXT. 747 — NOSE — DAY 66
MOVING DOWN the cockpit of the massive hull, seeing the
crew inside, PANNING ACROSS the nose of the plane and

The flight crew quietly monitoring the aircraft's con—
trols and instruments as the craft is buffeted by tur—
bulence, the terroist guard seated directly behind the
captain on a jump seat. The plane is on automatic pilot,
the crew totally unaware of the delivery plane's
presence.

EXT. 747 — BELLY SIDEVIEW — DAY 67

The delivery plane pulls forward into position,
approaching the nose area. Suddenly, the two planes are
hit by turbulence, the 747 surging downward, the delivery
plane darting quickly away.

INT. COCKPIT — DELIVERY PLANE 67A

The pilot and co—pilot maneuver the tiny plane into posi—
tion beneath the 747. Despite their obvious skill with
the aircraft, they are both incredibly tense, the opera—
tion requiring dead on, precision flying.

INT. MAIN CABIN AREA — DAY 68

As it is hit by turbulence, the PARTITIONS, CABINETS
RATTLING with the shock. Ali Hassan looks around him,

a worried look on his face. Suddenly the plane is hit
again, Ali buckling at the knees, nearly falling. He
grabs a cabin phone, beads of sweat forming on his face.

ALI HASSAN

You will obey!

The Terrorist COCKS his PISTOL, leveling it at the
pilot's head.

CAPTAIN
Then you'd better shoot.

Better yet, you know all about
this plane, you do it.

The Terrorist hesitates, staring at the pilot.

INT. COCKPIT — DELIVERY PLANE — DAY 70

Recovering from the turbulent air, the PILOT begins yet
another approach. The delivery plane eases toward the
belly of the 757, filling the windshield. Suddenly the
747 drops, the Pilot jerking hard on the yoke, darting
the agile craft away from the plunging mass above them.

PILOT
May have enough fuel for one more
pass. We should break off, find
the tanker and refuel. Your call,
Colonel, but make it quick.

Travis looks back at Baker who consults his tac—board.
He shakes his head, no. Travis turns back to the Pilot.

Cahill, at his station, is looking through a viewer while
grasping a control—stick in one hand.

POV — BELLY OF 747 SEEN THROUGH VIEWER 74A
Powerful lights play along the hull as the delivery plane
moves forward. A small hatch appears in the viewer. As
the hatch is centered, a red—targeting grid appears over

the hatch. A BEEP is heard.

CAHILL (V.O.)

Steady... steady. You're right
on it... activated!
INT. COCKPIT — DELIVERY PLANE — DAY 75

On the screen in the dashboard a target—image appears, a
read—out at the edges indicating closing speed and
distance.

PILOT
I have the target. Prepare for

ON the screen, the target grows closer as the Pilot
'lands' the plane into the belly of the 747.

The PILOT'S VOICE cracks over the speaker.

As another wave of turbulence hits, Ali again grabs the
phone. He is obviously very worried about something.

ALI HASSAN

Why are we not climbing!

He listens, his face incensed at what he hears. He slams
down the phone, moving towards the front, passengers
reacting with new alarm to the heavy buffeting the plane
is receiving at times.

INT. CABIN AREA — DELIVERY PLANE — DAY 78

Cahill quickly reads a series of gauges on the tower,
indicating pressure lock at 5,000 HG IN. A HISS of AIR
as he throws a switch, pressurizing the tunnel.

CAHILL
Primary tunnel is pressurized and
stable. I'm going up.

Travis motions to Baker who moves up behind Cahill,
Baker holding a stainless steel clip in his hand.

TRAVIS
(to Cahill)
As soon as that final hatch is
open, get the hell out of the way.

Cahill nods, then cautiously releases the locking device
on the hatch. He pushes it upward, securing it, exposing
the interior of the tunnel.

INT. DOCKING TUNNEL — DAY 79

Cahill climbs up the interior ladder. At the top of the
tunnel is a second pressure hatch, isolating the outside
collar and the skin of the 747. This section as well as
the hatch is made of clear, plastic, enabling Cahill to
physically examine the suction pumps outside.

Cahill studies a series of pressure and vacuum gauges and
then using a flashlight, inspects the suction pumps,
verifying that there is a complete seal with the skin of
the 747.

the outer chamber.

Carefully he opens a bleed valve, a HISS of AIR as the
final link is pressurized. Cahill studies the gauges,
consulting his watch. Taking a deep breath, he gently
opens the final hatch, swinging it down into the chamber.

CAHILL
I'm opening the hatch...

He opens the hatch, revealing the belly of the 747 and
the avionics hatch, surrounded by the heavy neoprene
vacuum—collar. Cahill releases the locking device on
the 747 hatch, lowering it into the tunnel. Quickly,
urged by Baker, he scrambles up the ladder and inside
the 747 as Baker follows, quickly placing the steel clip
over a switch, closing it.

INT. 747 COCKPIT — DAY 80

A flashing yellow light on the dash winks off. The
First Officer thumps it with his finger.

Running crosswise to the plane, the nerve—center of the
aircraft housing the flight recorder, transmitters,
receivers and the main electrical connectors. Cahill
climbs into the room, reaching down to grab a bag.

Below, Travis stands at the ladder, directing the
boarding. Grant follows Baker, who has already begun
attaching a series of electrical leads to the ship's
power supply in preparation for his equipment. Seconds
later, Rat scrambles into the room, followed by Charlie.

But as Charlie enters the hatch, his pack catches on the
clip securing the warning switch, the clip falling unseen

Cappy has just cleared the hatch and is starting to rise
to his feet, both hands on equipment bags, when the PLANE
is HIT by windshear, a sudden and VIOLENT SHOCK as the
plane falls several hundred feet before it bottoms out
on solid air.

With the impact, Rat is thrown off balance, his body
slamming into Cappy, sending him airborne across the
narrow room.

CAPPY'S POV OF ROOM 89A

A DIZZYING RAPID DOLLY TOWARDS an electrical panel con—

BACK TO SCENE 89B

Cappy, arms forward, smashes into panel, his right hand
splintering a plastic safety cover protecting a huge,
high voltage fuse, a blinding EXPLOSION of sparks and
flames as his hand hits the fuse. Instantly, Cappy is
blown backwards, the back of his neck slamming into the
corner of a steel equipment rack. He falls to the floor,
his hand smoking, his sleeve on fire.

Baker leaps on Cappy, smothering the fire with his body,
Cappy's face in contorted, agonizing pain, barely resist—

Travis at the bottom of the tunnel, grabs for the hatch
when ANOTHER BUFFETING knocks him aside. He recovers,
grabbing the release. As he does he looks up, eyes
locking with Grant's, a frozen moment, a look from Travis
as if he were entrusting the rest of the mission to Grant.
And then...

TRAVIS
Close the hatch!!!

Hesitant but obeying, Grant reaches down, closing the
hatch to the 747...

But as Travis pulls the lower hatched closed, the delivery
plane pulls free from the 747.

The escaping pressure turns into a SCREAM of AIR, followed
by a THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION that rips through the plane.

As the tower tears loose, the implosion sucks Travis
through the tower as if a leaf in a gale.

EXT. DELIVERY PLANE — DAY 97

A moment of silence, broken by the Director's voice.

DCI
(quietly)
Something must have failed with
the airlock and they depressurized.

Kaplan turns away from the overhead screen, his eyes
cold and hard. He addresses the Admiral.

KAPLAN
Where is the Task Force, Admiral?

The Admiral points to a location on the situation board.

ADMIRAL
Carrier Task Force Six has been
diverted and is heading towards
an intercept point in the Atlantic.

PRESIDENT
Go to Red Alert. Contact the
President.

He looks up at the situation board, at the flashing dot,
advancing steadily onward towards the United States.

INT. 747 AVIONICS ROOM — DAY 100A

Cappy is lying on the floor, his face covered in sweat,
writhing in pain as Baker carefully sprays antiseptic
over Cappy's burned hand and forearm, wrapping the area
with gauze bandages.

BAKER
Best I can do for now. I've got
some morphine, take care of that

pain.

CAPPY
No... Might need me... Got to stay
awake...

But as Baker moves Cappy's arm across his chest to
isolate it, Cappy inhales sharply in pain.

CAPPY
Baker... My neck. Whole left
sife... burns like acid.
(moves fingers of
left hand)

All down my arm...

Alarmed, Baker carefully feels behind Cappy's neck,
gingerly palpitating down his neck, stopping at a point
near the shoulder blades. Cappy again winces, nearly
fainting from the pain.

BAKER
There's a depression, a deformity
of C—7...
(looks up)

He's got a fractured vertebrae.
We've got to immobilize him.

INT. 747 — COCKPIT — DAY 100B

The Flight Engineer is patiently trying to explain to
Ali his need to go into the avionics room.

FLIGHT ENGINEER
We don't know what happened. But
I've got to go down there, check
it out. We could have a fire,
anything.

ALI
Where is this room?

The Engineer points to a hatch on the floor near the
rear of the cockpit.

The Engineer opens the hatch, peering down the narrow
ten foot shaft, leading through the stairwell bulkhead
and into the avionics room.

INT. AVIONICS ROOM — DAY 100C

With the hatch above them open, light streaming down

from above, the men move rapidly for cover, Cappy left
where he lays, hidden in the shadows. Anxious looks from
the men as they draw their weapons.

INT. 747 COCKPIT — DAY 100D

The Flight Engineer descends into the tunnel, Ali
standing over him, a flashlight in his hand, the
Terrorist Guard pointing a gun at him. The Engineer
looks at the gun.

FLIGHT ENGINEER
Relax. I'm not going anywhere.

INT. AVIONICS ROOM — DAY 100E

The Engineer enters the darkened, cramped room, moving
towards the electrical panel. He shines a tiny flash—
light on the broken fuse cover, examining the destruction
with a puzzled look. Suddenly he grows wary, slowly
turning, looking down at the floor, into the shadows and
Cappy's sweating, pain—racked face. He's about to speak
when he looks up, directly into Rat's face, a pistol
pointed at him. Dumbstruck the Engineer watches as Rat
indicates silence, then points to the small American Flag
on his shoulder.

The Engineer looks around, seeing other faces, staring
at him, weapons pointed.

Rat gestures to the panel, then upwards towards the cock—
pit, as if to say, "Hurry up."

The Engineer turns back, throwing a switch, replaces the
fuse, then restores the power to the fuse. Again, Rat
gestures for silence, offering the "okay" sign. The
Engineer numbly nods his understanding and moves back to
the ladder. He looks up into the cockpit, Ali standing
above, shining a flashlight on him. The Engineer climbs
the ladder.

INT. 747 — COCKPIT — DAY 100F

The Engineer enters the room, closing the hatch. The
Pilot turns.

PILOT
Everything okay down there?

FLIGHT ENGINEER
Huh? Oh, yeah. Just a blown fuse.
Must have been the turbulence.

The Pilot seems puzzled by this but the Engineer turns
and sits at his station, staring at his instruments, still
in shock at what he has just seen below.

INT. AVIONICS ROOM — DAY 101

Cappy has been strapped to a blackboard made from a bulk—
head panel. Cahill, looking pale and stunned, watches
with Grant as Rat and Charlie hold Cappy's head as Baker
places a makeshift cervical collar of foam insulation
around Cappy's neck. Baker then carefully tapes Cappy's
head and shoulders to the blackboard. Cappy closes his
eyes, resting.

A silence descends on the tiny room.

CHARLIE
(quietly)
What about Travis, the others?

CAHILL
(numb)
The plane depressurized. At this
altitude,, the airframe would
have collapsed, like an egg shell.
They couldn't have...

The team is silent, stunned by the reality of their
situation.

BAKER
Now what? We've got no radio,
half the equipment...

CHARLIE
We're fucked, that's what.

Cahill suddenly panics.

CAHILL
They don't know we're here.
Think we're all dead...

CAHILL (CONT'D)

They're going to blow us out of

the sky!
Cahill turns to them, panic filling his face.

CAHILL
We have to negotiate with them.
Tell them they know about their
plot, they'll never let them reach
the United States. It's our only
chance.

Rat, assessing their situation, speaks up.

RAT

I'm in charge, Cahill. Sit down
and shut up.

(beat)
There's only one thing we can do.
Take over the plane, let them know
we're in command and then land it
some place safe. As planned.

CAHILL
Look at you. There's nothing
left. You've got no chance.
We're the only ones who know
they aren't going to make it.
They have to listen...

Rat reaches out, grabbing Cahill by the shirt, yanking
him forward, nose to nose.

RAT

(coolly)
Get a grip, Cahill.

(beat)
We're all in the this together,
so just hang with us and do what
you're told. Now sit your ass
down and stay put.

Stunned but under control, Cahill nods, Rat releasing
him.

Silence settles over the room, the men now realizing
there is but one choice facing them.

RAT
All right. We need to know how
many, where they are, how they're
armed.

(CONTINUED)

BAKER
We should set up the probes,
mikes.

(nods to Grant)
Let the Captain here have a
listen. Could be a dozen of them,
we don't know.

RAT
Okay. What's left of the gear?

BAKER
Not much. No radio, scanners,
sleep agent, only half the weapons.
We've got fiber optic probes and
mikes, infra—red goggles, bomb
kit. That's it.

RAT
And no one to fly the plane.
What's our time frame?

Baker consults a Plexiglass card, three analog watches
indicating elapsed time; time on board; time to fail
safe, the sweep hands moving at steady, unstoppable
speed.

BAKER
Unless a change in speed and
course, we've got three hours
and forty—eight minutes.

RAT
All right. We figure out where
they are, how to hit 'em.

He points to the power control boxes on the bulkheads.

RAT
Power for lights, everything is
right here. We blow the lights,
use infra—red to hit 'em hard
while they're still surprised.
(beat)
Let's get started.

Again, Grant's cautious warning sounds out.

GRANT
You're forgetting something.

RAT
What's that?

GRANT
The bomb.

RAT
We'll worry about that after we
take the plane. We can't spare
the time to look for it.

GRANT
I don't think you can afford not
to...
RAT
(irritated)

Let's get one thing straight,
Captain. You're still along as
an advisor. Stick with the
interpreting. When I need your
opinion, you'll know it.

GRANT
It's more complicated than chain
of command. Finding that bomb
is just as important, maybe more,
than taking over this plane.
Think about it.

From his stretcher, Cappy calls out.

CAPPY

He's right. Got to know if
there's a bomb.

(beat)
Could be a pressure switch, timer.
Try to land the plane, change
altitude, anything could set it
off. Don't know what you're
dealing with. Got to find it.

The men look to Rat for a decision. Rat looks at Cappy,

then to Grant. He nods.

RAT
We'll look for it while we're
setting up. Charlie, tools and
bomb kit. Get started.

INT. 747 COCKPIT — DAY 103

The Flight Engineer is staring at the hatch on the floor,
leading to the Avionics Room. He looks up at the
terrorist guard in the doorway and then to the pilots, a
look of frustration on his face. He's dying to tell them.

INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT — DAY 104

Rat, reaching the bulkhead leading to the forward galley,
uses a pair of hydraulically powered shears to cut
through the wall.

INT. FORWARD GALLEY — DAY 105

Carefully pushing aside the bulkhead, Rat, gun in hand,
enters the galley. Seeing the blanket on the floor, he
pulls it back, finding the dead attendant. He replaces
the blanket, going to the elevator door, carefully
opening it. Seeing that the lift is above him on the
main cabin level, he begins to cut the rivet heads from
the floor using his shears.

INT. NOSE OF PLANE — BELOW FIRST CLASS — DAY 106

Where Baker, using a heavily padded, nearly silent
ELECTRIC DRILL, bores a tiny hole into the ceiling.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN — NOSE SECTION — DAY 107

CLOSE ON a section of carpet as the ceramic tip of the
drill silently emerges at a forward angle. As we PULL
BACK, we realize that the drill has just missed the boot
of one of the terrorist guards. An inch in the other
direction...

INT. NOSE OF PLANE — BELOW FIRST CLASS — DAY 108

Removing the ceramic bit, Baker inserts into one of the
two holes he has drilled a spike microphone and into the
other, a fiber—optic probe. He plugs the microphone into
his com—unit.

On the viewscope he sees two huge boots, grossly
distorted by the wide—angle lens.

pausing at the work station by the staircase leading to
the upper level.

BAKER
(to mike)
Got one. First class cabin. W.Z.
63 machine gun, grenade, and 9mm
pistol.

As he continues to watch, the terrorist from the cockpit,
descends the staircase to talk. Baker switches on a tiny
bug mike and we faintly hear the CONVERSATION in ARABIC...

INT. AVIONICS ROOM — DAY 109

Grant is seated before a fold—out, portable control panel,
a series of lights and switches indicating the various
locations of the highly sensitive spike mikes. Grant
writes: "First Class" on a piece of tape, sticking it on
the board. He listens to the conversation in Arabic.

GRANT
(to headset)
Sounds like one more on guard in
the upstairs cockpit and business
class area.

INT. OVERHEAD SECTION — DAY (MINUTES LATER) 110

Where Rat, suspended upside—down, attached to a special
harness to a thin cable, strung the entire length of the
plane, pulls himself along on silent rollers, a human
gondola. The air temperature is cold enough to fog the
breath.

RAT
(to headset)
Okay, I'll check it out. I'm at
mid—cabin. Hold on...

He stops, twisting to his side, pushing the viewscope
probe and mike through a joint in one of the ceiling
panels.

RAT'S POV OF THE CABIN BELOW 110A

Seen through the wide—angle lens, the rows of passengers
directly below him. The probe moves, revealing more
sections of the cabin, holding on the mid—section galley
area where four terrorists, including Ali Hassan, are
gathered, listening to the SHORT—WAVE and MILITARY RADIOS.

INT. MID—CABIN WORK STATION — DAY 116A
Fran enters and begins preparing coffee. She removes a

packet of coffee from a drawer, dumping the old coffee
filter in the trash. She searches for a new filter, and
finding none, reaches to an overhead cabinet, opening it.
As she does, Ali's coat, hung over the aprons, falls to
the floor. As she bends to pick it up, a folded map falls
to the floor. Fran can see that it is an aeronautical
navigation map, part of the Washington, D.C. area exposed.
Cautiously Fran opens the map, seeing an air corridor
approaching the Washington airport where the White House
and other government buildings are located, heavily
circled in red marker, the notation: "2,000 feet," in
handwriting.

She studies the map and then carefully refolds it,
replacing it in the inside pocket. As she stands, Ali
walks into the room. Fran looks at the coat.

FRAN
I'm sorry. It fell when I opened

reaches to his waistband, his hand closing on the handle
of his pistol, the move hidden by the coat.

ALI
How are the passengers? Are they
comfortable?

FRAN
They're... very scared, but under

the circumstances doing well.
Ali's eyes, probing, searching.

ALI
It's important they remain calm.
Is there anything they need?

FRAN
No. They just want this to be
over with.

ALI
Soon enough. A few more hours. I
will share something with you, but
it must remain between us.
(studying her)

When we land... in London. We
will be releasing the women and
children.

Fran stares at him, knowing this is a lie.

FRAN
That would be very kind.

He studies at her a long moment, then removes his hand
from the gun, folding the coat.

ALI
I'm keeping you from your work.

He turns and leaves. Fran stares ahead, her hands
trembling. She knows something horrible is going to
happen with this highjacking and she has to do something.
But what? She sees the empty clipboard where the manifest
had been, thinks, and then removes from her apron her
ballpoint pen.

moving one of the probes over a container. He adjusts
the sensitivity of the instrument and then keys his mike.

Fran walks down the aisle, stopping at a seat. For a
moment, all we see are the brown leather boots of the
Air Marshal.

FRAN
I believe you're next, sir.

The AIR MARSHAL, early 30s, mustache, dark hair, looks
up, puzzled.

FRAN
The bathrooms. You're next.

Something in her eyes.

AIR MARSHAL
Thank you.

As he rises she moves away, face close to his, whisper—
ing, barely audible.

FRAN
(whispering)
Razor blades...

She turns to the passenger across the aisle, leaving the
Marshal bewildered over her phrase as he heads down the
aisle.

INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT — DAY 119

We MOVE ACROSS the tops of baggage containers, barely two
feet of clearance overhead. Tiny lights have been
clipped to the ceiling, illuminating the darkened room
with red light.

We ARRIVE at a container, opened up like a soup can,
baggage strewn everywhere. Overhead lights illuminate
the open container as if it were the crater at Tycho in
2001. Inside is Rat and Charlie. Charlie examines some—
thing in the container with his detector.

CHARLIE
Almost missed it. Reading was
less than one part in two million.

Inside we see a dismantled wooden packing crate, revealing
a three—tiered object, at the bottom of which are two

rows of double—ended bottles, two feet long, six inches

in diameter, stacked two deep, a total of 12 bottles.

The surface of the bottles is a shiny, metallic material,
like mirrored sunglasses. Strapped to the canisters

with stainless steel bands, is a black metal box, two

feet high.

RAT
Whatever it is, it's sittin' on
enough Semtex to fuck up your
whole day.

CHARLIE
(nervously)
Let's do it.

Using a hand—powered drill, Rat carefully drills a tiny
hole into the case. He attaches a fiber—optic probe,
peering through the eyepiece. He looks up.

RAT
Take a look.

Charlie uses the probe to examine the container. He
looks up, confused.

CHARLIE
Way out of my league.

Rat studies the interior again, thinks a moment and then
keys his mike.

INT. REAR OF PLANE — DAY 120A

The Air Marshal waits near the bathrooms, a Terrorist
on guard. A passenger leaves one of the bathrooms, the
Guard gesturing to the Marshal to enter.

GUARD
Thirty seconds.

The Marshal enters, attempting to close the door, the
Guard shoving his foot INTO the FRAME.

GUARD
Leave it open.

INT. BATHROOM — DAY 120B

Leaving the door slightly ajar, the Marshal faces the
toilet, eyes searching the room, focusing on the tiny
sign near the sink: "DISPOSE OF RAZOR BLADES HERE."
Still facing the toilet he opens the tiny disposal box,
removing a folded slip of paper. He reads:

"Plane going to Wash. D.C. Target
White House. Do something."

Behind him the DOOR EXPLODES OPEN, the Marshal dropping
the paper into the toilet...

TERRORIST
Too long! Back to your seat!

The Marshal bends to flush, the note stuck to the bowl
near the top. He FLUSHES, the water flowing over the
note, still stuck. He FLUSHES AGAIN...

TERRORIST

The Terrorist yanks the Marshal around, just as the
water catches the paper, swirling it down the toilet.

You'd better get Cappy.
RAT
We can't move him.
GRANT
I don't think you've got any other

choice.

Rat considers this and then nods to Charlie.

INT. PENTAGON WAITING ROOM — DAY 122

The Arab Diplomat and an Assistant are in the room. The
Secretary of State, the DCI and Kaplan enter the room.
The Diplomat hands a document to Kaplan who grimly reads
its contents.

ARAB DIPLOMAT
The man who designed the bomb is
most probably Jean—Paul Demou.
That's a recent photograph. He's
French, nuclear engineer, once
assigned to a reactor plant in
Damascus, Syria. His wife, a
Syrian national, was killed during
an Israeli attack on the plant,
three years ago.

Kaplan hands the document to the DCI then offers his
hand to the Arab.

KAPLAN
Thank you for your help. Please
excuse me.

He takes the two men aside.

KAPLAN

SECRETARY OF STATE
If we have to shoot down the 747,
why release Jaffa at all?

DCI
We have to take Ali's word that
there will be more bombings in
London if he's not airborne by
three.

KAPLAN

Contact Ambassador Hennings in
London. I want to deliver a
message to Jaffa. I want him to
negotiate with Ali Hassan. Tell

we will exchange the lives of the
passengers for Ali's, if he will
divert to an isolated airbase.
Jaffa's the only one who knows the

container, Cappy grimacing in pain from the movement.

RAT
Sorry to do this to you, Cappy.
But we've got a bad one here.

GRANT
It's some form of computer
controlled triggering device, very
sophisticated.

CAPPY
(in pain)
Let me have a look.

Baker attaches a second eyepiece to the unit, holding
one to Cappy's eye as he squeezes the trigger. Grant
observes the interior along with Cappy.

CAPPY'S POV — INT. BOMB 124A

In the eerie illumination of the probe is revealed a
forest of printed circuit boards, and in one section, a
rotating laser—disc—like mechanism, connected through a
series of relays and wires to a thick floor of dark
orange material at the base of the computer, sitting
directly atop the nerve gas.

RETURN TO SCENE 124B

Cappy studying the bomb.

CAPPY
Micro—processor, dedicated fixed
drive, least 40 megabytes... could

be running a dozen programs...
Cappy now sees the guts of the bomb, the lens moving
around, showing the relays and probes, pressed into the
plastic explosive at the base.

CAPPY
Take me in a little closer...

As the lens zooms in and moves around the interior,
Cappy grows more concerned and focused by the second.

This is major—league talent.

The lens plays across a glass tube with several elements

inside.

CAPPY

Now what is this? Stop. Go in

Now that's something I do recognize.
Barometric pressure switch.
Activated on take—off, probably

if you can disable that switch,
it might buy you some time.

Grant stands, looking into the faces of the men grouped
around him. Rat ponders the situation.

RAT
Okay, we go as planned. We shut
this thing down, take over the
plane and get it to someplace safe.

CHARLIE
Who gets to fuck with the mousetrap?

They're stumped on this one. Grant speaks up.

GRANT
Cahill.
RAT

Grant pats Cahill on the shoulder. He moves over the
cargo containers towards the bomb where Cappy lies,
Cahill reluctantly following.

GRANT
All right, Cappy. Walk him
through it. Call me if you need
any help.

Grant leaves.

CAPPY
Don't worry, Cahill, this is just
like playing with Leggos, but more
exciting. Bring that bomb kit
over here and let's get started.

Cahill slides the bomb kit into position.

CAPPY
First things first. Looks like
that black cover is just a lead
shield. See if you can lift it
off... But, Cahill, everything
real easy, okay?

Grant carefully releases the four spring—latches at the
base of the cover. He removes the fiber—optic probe and
then gently lifts the cover, revealing the bomb in its
entirety.

formulate a plan.

INT. AVIONICS ROOM — DAY 125B

Grant is on the com—board, headset on, monitoring the
various microphones and serving as the link to the team.

He keys a switch labeled "CAHILL."

GRANT
Cahill. How you doing?

INT. BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT — DAY 126

Cahill is huddled over the bomb, Cappy's bomb—kit open
beside him, an electronic detector attached to the wires
near the barometric switch.

A mirror, taken from a vanity case, has been attached
to Cappy's stretcher by an aluminum pole, somewhat like
a rear—view mirror. From his position, Cappy can
supervise Cahill's work on the bomb.

CAHILL
(to mike)
Uh, okay, I guess. We're ready to
start.
(to Cappy)

Cappy. The meter indicates 15 oms.

CAPPY
Okay, that's good. Looks like it's
in parallel and isolated. Go ahead
and complete the by—pass.

Cahill attaches the end of an alligator clip to the right
side of the switch, completing a by—pass loop of the unit.

INT. ELEVATOR — COACH LEVEL — DAY 127

FROM ABOVE, we see the floor of the elevator pushed
upward, revealing Rat in the lower galley. With the
skill of a gymnast he carefully wedges his way upward
into the elevator, holding his body against the wall as
he closes the floor panel.

Holding tight to the wall, he carefully peers out the
elevator window, seeing Fran, her back to him, working at
the galley.

INT. MID—CABIN WORK STATION — DAY 128

Fran catches sight of a movement, reflected in the
polished surface of the stainless steel wall. Startled,
she turns and before Rat can duck, their eyes meet, a
look of total shock registering on her face. The flag is
visible on Rat's shoulder as he puts his finger to his
lips.

Suddenly Fran hears SOMEONE APPROACHING from behind, Ali
appearing. A moment's hesitation and then she turns,
grabbing a coffee urn and a cup. Putting her back to the
elevator window, she offers Ali a cup of coffee. He
stares at her suspiciously and then accepts the coffee.

INT. ELEVATOR — DAY 129

Rat rapidly turns his attention to the overhead panel.
Pulling the panel downward, he pulls himself into the
upper section, reaching down to close the panel.

INT. WORK STATION — DAY 130

Ali sips the coffee, studying Fran. He's very uneasy
about something but he can't put his finger on it.
Finally he moves on.

Fran looks around her, and then cautiously shoots a
glance inside the elevator. It's empty. We FOLLOW her
gaze UPWARDS to the overhead panels.

INT. 747 OVERHEAD SECTION — DAY 131

Above the coach section, the longest open space of the
plane, consisting of support struts and ribs for the
ceiling structure; air conditioning units; ducting,
wiring and hydraulic lines. Rat is crouched on one knee,
closing the top panel to the elevator shaft.

RAT
(to mike)
Shit, I was made. Attendant saw
me in the elevator.

Short blonde hair, five six.

GRANT
Okay. I'll have Baker keep an
eye on her. All we can do is
watch, hope she can keep a secret.
(switches)
Baker...

INT. OVERHEAD SECTION — DAY 131B

Rat continues on, spider—walking along the support beams,
reaching up to clip in to the trolley cable when his foot
hits a patch of grease, his foot flying out from under him.
In one cat—like movement, Rat flips his position, catching
himself spread—eagled over the lower support beams,
directly over the plastic ceiling panels for the main
cabin. Sweat drips from his face as he carefully regains
his position.

INT. MAIN CABIN AREA — DAY 132
Fran studies the ceiling, half—expecting the commando

seen earlier to come crashing through to the floor. She
looks at Ali, some distance behind her, watching her,
unaware of the disturbance she has just heard.

INT. OVERHEAD SECTION — DAY 133

As Rat, moving down the cable, approaching the forward—
most section of the plane, Charlie's voice cuts in.

CHARLIE (V.O.)

(filtered)
I'm in position, mid—cabin.
They're all over the place. I can
take two, maybe three. I'm good,

but I ain't that good. We need
another gun.

RAT
Okay, stand by. I'm at the
forward section. Let's see how
bad it is up there.

He moves on, pulling himself along the cable towards the
forward section.

INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT — DAY 134

Grant wipes the sweat from his brow and taking a pair of
clippers from Cahill, moves his hand into the heart of
the bomb.

CAPPY

Cahill, could you adjust the
mirror? I want to take a better
look at this thing.

(Cahill adjusts

mirror)
That's better. Now, clip the
wires on either side. Don't
touch anything else.

Cahill places the cutter around the wire. He hesitates
and then, clips the wire, watching the om meter, the
needle darting slightly and then holding on: 15 oms.
Relieved, he clips the second wire.

CAPPY
Good work. That should do it.

Relieved, Cahill sits back, keying his com—unit.

CAHILL
(to mike)
We've isolated the pressure switch.

INT. AVIONICS ROOM — DAY 134A

Grant switches from Cahill on the "B" channel to the "A"
channel.

GRANT
Rat, this is Grant. They've
isolated the switch.

RAT (V.O.)
Thanks. All right, everyone in
final positions. Captain, I need
to see you in the forward galley,
right away.

Grant seems puzzled by this.

EXT. GATWICK AIRFIELD (LONDON) — DAY 135

A Mercedes sedan, darkened windows, pulls alongside,
accompanied by a military escort. Three Arabs emerge
from the car, two obviously pilots, carrying flight bags,
the other, a grim—faced MAN dressed in a tailored suit.

From the plane, a MECHANIC emerges, descending the stairs,
the name on his coveralls reading: Reggie. He addresses
the three men in a heavy Cockney accent.

MECHANIC
(grinning)
She's all yours, China—plate.

The Mechanic moves on, the grim—faced Man turning to the
pilots, speaking in Arabic.

MAN
(subtitles)
Search it. Everything.

The pilots enter the plane.

INT. GATWICK AIRPORT — VIP LOUNGE — DAY 136

Inside a commercial aviation building, now serving as a
heavily guarded holding room for Jaffa. Soldiers and
security men are everywhere. Seated on a couch, in a
darkened side of the room, is Jaffa, wearing a belly—
chain and handcuffs. The U.S. AMBASSADOR to England

is speaking to Jaffa, two marine guards standing
nearby.

AMBASSADOR
... If they will divert to Gander
Air Force Base, Newfoundland, the
United States will guarantee the
safe passage of Ali and his men
back to the Middle East.

(beat)

Otherwise, he will never be allowed
to reach the shores of the United
States.

Jaffa studies the Ambassador appraisingly. He may be in
chains but beginning to relish the power attending his
new found importance. He smiles, assuming a diplomatic
air.

JAFFA
Ali is an impassioned man, but in
the interests of peace, I will do
my best.

AMBASSADOR
I am sure you will.

INT. 747 FORWARD GALLEY — DAY 137

Rat and Grant are conferring off to one side of the
elevator, just below the emergency escape hatch, leading
to the main cabin aisle above. Rat hands Grant a hand
shotgun, the size of a flare gun.

RAT
There's just too many of them,
Captain. We need another gun.

Grant looks at the weapon.

GRANT
It's been years since I even
handled a gun...

RAT
Don't worry, with this you can't
miss. One guy on station just
above us. I'll cue you, you'll
have the element of surprise.

Rat grabs the escape handle to the hatch in one hand,
holding the weapon tight to his chest in the other.

RAT
Hold it tight, like this. Push
up hard, two steps up the ladder,
aim straight at his chest and fire.
Don't think, just shoot.

EXT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER (MID—ATLANTIC) — DAY 138

As the squadron of F—14's are launched from the catapults,
SCREAMING upward, silver messengers of death.

INT. 747 BUSINESS CLASS CLOSET STORAGE AREA — DAY 139

Directly behind business class. Rat emerges from a
service hatch, easing to the floor inside the closet.
Cautiously he parts the two doors, looking into the
business class compartment and the cockpit just beyond.

RAT

In the business class closet. I'll
be set in about thirty seconds.

He stares at the weapon in his hand.

RAT (V.O.)

Baker eases down into the room, taking up position at
the door.

INT. OVERHEAD SECTION — DAY 143

Where Charlie has placed a circle of detonation cord on
the floor. He's positioned on a support beam above the
ceiling panel, holding the detonating switch in his hand.
He looks prepared to jump after he blows the floor.

CHARLIE
(to mike)
Charlie. Ready to blow the
ceiling.

INT. BUSINESS CLASS CLOSET — DAY 144

Rat, his hand on the doors, is holding a silenced .22

automatic pistol. Through a crack in the door he can

see the Terrorist standing several feet away, his back
to him.

RAT
(whisper)
Okay, dude is right in my sights.
Here we go...

145 INT. FORWARD GALLEY — DAY 145

Grant releases the safety on the deadly—looking hand
shotgun, his hand trembling. He nervously double—checks
the unfamiliar weapon, making sure it is cocked. He
closes his eyes, blinking away the sweat.

The lights flash again.
CAPPY

This is the Arab country

He sits back, a cold smile forming on his lips.

JAFFA
I taught you well, Ali.

INT. 747 — COACH SECTION — DAY 159

Ali Hassan turns OFF the RADIO shouting a revolutionary
slogan, the other Terrorists taking up the cry.

At this, terror sweeps through the plane. Ali Hassan is
now truly a man possessed with carrying out his destiny,
and with it, the lives of thousands of innocent people.

Hassan turns and looks at someone in the seats before
him, a passenger, someone unseen to us. He gives a
slight nod and then moves on, shouting another cry of
revenge.

We HOLD ON Fran as she looks from the frightened faces

of the passengers to the overhead panels, aware that

some inescapable collision between these madmen and some
unseen force infiltrating the airplane is about to happen.
But who are they, how did they get here, when will they
strike?

Whomever he chooses to implicate.

SECRETARY OF STATE
I say we shoot the bastard down.

KAPLAN
If only we could. They'll stick

listening to a CONVERSATION in ARABIC.

GRANT
Quiet... sounds like something
big's going on.

Grant continues to listen.

GRANT

floor, killing him. Ali looks up, madness raging in his

eyes. Several other terrorists look at him in total fear.
ALI HASSAN
Traitor!

Hell, we might even get lucky.

Rat looks at the men, confused as to what the next plan
of attack should be, realizing he has nothing left to
offer. He's out of ideas, sinking into the utter hope—
lessness of their situation. He looks at Grant, who
stares at the floor, deep in thought.

RAT
Captain.

Any ideas?

Grant looks at his watch. Thinks a moment.

GRANT
We might still have some time.
And there just might be a way to
find the sleeper.

But we've got to keep dismantling

Fran staring at the flashing light. She looks around,
seeing one of the Terrorist Guards standing nearby. She

looks at the flashing light... and then picks up the

GRANT
Just listen. I'm watching you on

bulkhead.

Disbelieving she turns, eyes searching, focusing on the
tiny probe, barely visible in the bulkhead.

GRANT
We're Americans. You've seen one
of us. There is a bomb on this
plane. One of the passengers is
in direct control of it. We have
to find him and we need your help.
You're looking for someone with
an electronic device, a radio...

Suddenly the phone is ripped from her hand, Ali roughly
spinning her around.

ALI
What are you doing?

Ali places the phone to his ear and listens. The line is

They continue to watch as Fran picks up a stack of
magazines and turns towards them. A moment's hesitation
and then she looks up, directly into the lens, a look of
strength and determination on her face, she nods. Grant
turns to Baker.

BAKER
She's with us. Lady's a player.

A momentary look from Rat, a nod of acceptance. Grant is
now in charge.

RAT
Good move, Captain. I'll get

visible carry—on luggage, bags and seat pockets for some

sign of a suspicious device, all the while pretending

to look after the needs of the passengers, offering them
magazines to read. Behind her, a Terrorist Guard keeps

a close watch.

INT. PENTAGON — OPERATIONS CENTER — DAY 176

PULLING BACK FROM the situation map, showing the 747's
position, now approaching the U.S. The Major—General
hangs up a telephone and addresses the Kaplan.

MAJOR—GENERAL
The F—14's should be intercepting
the 747 in approximately fifteen
minutes. Should be coming on
the board any second.

On the screen we see, four small points of light,
approaching the 747 from a converging angle, their origin
somewhere near Florida.

INT. MAIN CABIN SECTION — DAY 177

Fran approaches the Air Marshal, who looks up briefly.

She reaches his seat, casually handing him a magazine.
What the quard can't see is her expression as she taps the
cover of the magazine. The Marshal looks down seeing:

A Newsweek, a cover shot of a group of U.S. soldiers in
camouflage, weapons, the banner—line reading: "HOW MUCH
LONGER."

The Marshal looks up, Fran looking hard at the picture
and then mouthing the words: "They're here."

She moves on, leaving the Marshal to stare at the picture
in bewilderment. They're here?

Fran continues to search for some sign of suspicious
behavior, an electronic device, something. There seems
to be nothing but row upon row of frightened, innocent—
looking passengers.

CAPPY
Low—power, number one. Just touch
the wire for a heartbeat.

In Cahill's hand is a laser—knife, the size of a fountain
pen, a wire leading to a power box on the floor beside
him. Cahill touches the trigger and the beam changes
intensity, the wire suddenly vaporizing, leaving the bare
wire underneath exposed.

CAPPY
That's good. Now clip in.

Cahill wipes the sweat from his brow, his shirt soaked in
perspiration. At his side is a small black box, taken
from the bomb kit. At one end of the box are a series

of ports for electrical connections. Several wires lead
from the ports to the bomb, clipped in to wires in
various components.

CAHILL
Here goes...

With trembling hands, he attaches another wire to a relay
in the bomb, plugging the other end into the black box.

CAPPY

Outstanding. You've got the major
sensors by—passed. Mr X will
still think the bomb's intact.

(beat)
Kick the power up to three and cut
the wires to that first relay.
That's a load—fluctuator, a fail—
safe against an electromagnetic
burst.

Cahill turns up the power and begins to move the laser—
knife towards the bomb. But his hand begins to tremble
uncontrollably. He stops.

CAHILL
(verge of panic;
anger)
I can't do it. My hand's shaking
too much. I can't breathe.

fine. You know anything about
fishing?

Take a deep breath. Relax.
Close your eyes.

(beat)
You're sitting at your desk...
it's in the middle of a pine
forest. Wind cool and light, the
sun shining down through the
trees. You're beside a stream,
water rollin' over the rocks into
the most beautiful pool of deep,
green water you've ever seen...

Cahill's breathing slows, his face beginning to relax.
Cappy closes his eyes.

CAPPY
... You get up from your desk and
walk to the pool, your fly rod in
your hand, royal coachman tied on,
your can't miss fly. At the back
of that pool is Bad Leroy Brown,
fifteen pound German trout, just
startin' to rise from beneath a
tangle of logs. Now, all you got
to do is pull back, float your
line out, lay that fly down like
a feather, right in front of old
Leroy's nose...

Cahill opens his eyes. His hand has stopped shaking. He
moves forward, cutting through the wires with the laser.

CAHILL
(relieved)
I did it.

He turns, looking at Cappy's face, reflected in the
mirror. Cappy nods, closing his eyes in relief.

As she passes a seat, a hand reaches out, tugging on her
apron. Startled, Fran turns. It's the heavy—set Woman
seen earlier. The Woman is perspiring and seems short of
breath.

WOMAN
Miss, may I have some water? I
have to take my medication.
Diabetes.

The Woman holds out a prescription pill vial.

FRAN
(distracted)
Of course. I'll get you some

water.
The Woman fumbles with the vial, her hands trembling.

WOMAN
These things are always so hard
to open...

The vial slips from her hands, falling to the floor.

FRAN
I'll get it.

Fran kneels to the floor to help. The Guard moves in,
prodding her with his weapon.

FRAN
(calmly)
It's all right. I'm just getting
her pills.

Fran kneels, searching the floor for the vial, finding it
next to the Woman's feet. She is about to rise when her
eyes freeze on the underseat storage space of the window
seat, where the Laptop Computer, seen earlier, sits,
nearly obscured from view.

Fran stares at the computer, slowly looking up into the
alarmed eyes of the dark—complected man at the window.

The Guard pulls Fran to her feet, examining the pill vial,
before giving it to the Woman.

FRAN
I'll be right back with your
water.

The man at the window follows their movement and then
carefully removes the computer, hiding it between his
body and the window bulkhead.

between movements, she hurriedly scribbles something on
the back of the tray with a lipstick.

CLOSE ON the TV monitor, showing Fran just inside the
galley. As one of the Terrorist Guards passes by, she
turns back to her station, busying herself with some—

brushes her ear several times, looking around her.

BAKER
Captain, take a look at this.

Grant studies the monitor as Fran again brushes her ear.

GRANT
She's signaling.
On the monitor we see a Terrorist Guard as he slowly
moves through the galley, crossing behind Fran. Lifting
the tray off the counter, Fran turns towards the camera,

flipping the bottom upwards as she does. On the bottom
of the tray, written in red lipstick, we see: 148—B.

CLOSE ON the monitor as the fiber—optic probe pans across
the heavy—set Woman's legs, zooming in on small computer,
tucked against the leg and the seat of the man in 148—B.

RAT
Could be a small computer, between
his leg and the seat. Looks like
he's hiding it. All I can see
is his legs. Air conditioning

computer is definitely suspicious.
It has to be him.

INT. OVERHEAD SECTION — DAY 186

Charlie is positioned near the mid—section restrooms in
the crawl—space above the doorways. Lying on his side

Holding the panel steady, Cahill lowers his head, using
the light on his head gear to scan between the two levels,
the second level consisting of a series of relays and a
softball—sized stainless steel sphere. He scans the area,

below, to a micro—switch.

You're right. There's a wire...
hooked to a switch.

Cahill unfolds a small tripod, supporting a shaft with a
suction cup at one end. He places the tripod over the
sphere gently pressing the suction cup over the cover.

CAPPY
Now back off, just a hair. Just
enough to see if it's friendly.

Cahill swallows hard, takes a deep breath and turns the
reverse—screw mechanism at the top of the tripod, lifting
the cover a fraction of an inch. He stops, using a tiny
penlight and a dentist's mirror to examine the edges and
the back side of the plate.

CAHILL
Can't see anything.

CAPPY
Okay, back it off a little more.

Cahill slowly removes the cover, revealing the interior
of the hollow sphere, at the bottom of which is a tiny
brass armature situated above a steel contact point,
similar to that in an automobile distributor.

CAPPY
Don't touch anything. Let me see
those points.

Cahill adjusts the mirror, holding a magnifying glass
over the sphere, focusing it for Cappy.

CAPPY
Looks clear. Don't think Mr. X
expected us to get this far. But
you need something thin and non—
metallic to slip between those
points.

Cahill searches through the kit but can't find anything
plastic. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out a
handful of cocktail napkins, paper, etc. He finds a
plastic coffee straw. Slitting the straw with a knife he
holds it out, ready to insert it between the points.

mates stare at her in disbelief.

GRANT (V.O.)
(filtered; urgent)
I need your help. The lower galley.
Do exactly as I say. Turn around
and enter the elevator. The lives
of everyone on this plane depend
upon what you do. Right now.

She quietly hangs up the phone and turns, looking into
the eyes of her frightened crew mates. She looks at the
elevator a few steps away.

With a determined look she moves forward, opening the
door and stepping inside.

INT. ELEVATOR — DUSK 221

Fran carefully closes the door. She turns, staring at the
overhead control buttons. Her finger touches the down
switch.

The elevator activates, MOTORS WHINING as it descends
into the lower galley.

INT. WORK STATION — DUSK 222

Hearing the sound of the ELEVATOR, Ali turns, seeing that
Fran is gone. He looks at the red light over the
elevator. He gestures to the elevator.

ALI
(subtitles)
Kill her.

Fran emerges from the elevator. Suddenly, Grant is
behind her, his hand over her mouth. He turns her around,
their eyes meeting.

The ELEVATOR ACTIVATES, lifting up to the main floor.

GRANT
No sound. Sit over there, put
your head down, like you're crying.
Do it, now.

She moves to the opposite bulkhead, pulling down the
jumpseat.

The MOTORS WHINE again as the elevator begins to lower.
The door opens and the Terrorist emerges. Seeing Fran
sitting across from him, he raises his weapon to fire.

A voice from behind calls out:

GRANT (O.S.)
Hey!

Startled, the Terrorist turns, facing Grant, aiming a .22
silenced pistol at him. The Terrorist starts to move and
Grant FIRES, TWICE, two tiny red holes appearing in the
Terrorist's head. He falls to the floor in a heap. Grant
is stunned, momentarily overcome by what he has just done.
Fran stares back at him, realizing this is not a cold—
blooded killer. He looks at her as if asking for help

and then kneels, stripping the Terrorist of his clothes.
He looks at Fran.

GRANT
The man in 148... we're going to
stop him.

FRAN
What do you want me to do?

He stares at her, fear in his eyes.
GRANT
Help me get close enough to kill
him.
Grant continues to strip the clothes from the Terrorist.

CHARLIE (V.O.)
Here's how it goes: soon as you
hit the sleeper, it's lights out
and we go. We're on infra—red.
The plane's system will kick the
lights back on in six seconds,
that's all the surprise we've got.
Make it count.

Grant lays down the headset, pulling Fran into the
elevator.

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER — CONFERENCE ROOM — DUSK 226

Kaplan and his team are watching the situation map, show—
ing the 747's position, relative to the U.S. coast—line,
the F—14's tracking the jet, and a flashing, fail—safe
line, indicating that the 747 has already crossed the
point where it was determined it must be destroyed. The
elapsed time clock indicates six minutes remaining on the
additional ten minutes.

MAJOR—GENERAL
They'll be starting their descent
in about ten minutes.

DCI

At thirty—five thousand feet our
loses would be minimal. Every
thousand feet of descent, the
death toll from fallout will
increase dramatically.

(beat)
I pray you've made the right
decision.

Kaplan continues to stare at the situation map.

As he does, we PAN DOWN TO the table, to the open folder,
the one previously given to Kaplan by the Arab diplomat.
We SLOWLY PUSH IN ON a photograph of a man, early fifties,
fair complextion, balding, with cold, intense eyes. It
is a face we have never seen before, certainly not the
man in 148—B.

The dark—complected man in 148—B looks cautiously around
him pushing his computer deeper into the seat.

INT. MID—CABIN WORK STATION — DUSK 228

Grant emerges from the elevator, pushing Fran as if she
were his prisoner. Holding the automatic weapon in his
left hand as a shield across his face, we see that in
his right hand he is holding the .22 Beretta, flat
against her back.

GRANT
(whisper)
Just keep walking. Eyes straight
ahead. When I push you, hit the
floor and stay down.

Fran moves forward, her face frozen with fear. They
enter the aisle, moving towards the man at the window,
his head barely visible some ten rows away. On the

other side of the cabin, the Terrorist Guard sees them,
but as he can only view Grant from the rear, he continues
on his patrol.

Grant focuses his attention on the man, now seven rows
away. But he fails to see the Terrorist on patrol in
the next section aft, moving AWAY FROM us and towards
the work station.

INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT — DUSK 229

With the intensity of a jeweler about to cut the Hope
Diamond, Cahill guides the plastic straw close to the
open points, through the deadly, complicated maze of
light beams.

CAHILL
(to himself)
Little more, little more... light
as a feather. Come on up, Leroy,
you're all mine... easy now.

In CLOSEUP we see that Cahill is almost to the points
with the plastic strip.

Grant is now only three rows away. As he takes the last
step he pushes Fran aside, spins around, leveling the

pistol directly at the man's face.

We RACK FOCUS OVER the gunsights of the pistol INTO the
paralyzed face of the man in 148—B. Grant's finger
touches the trigger and then, stops...

Grant stares at the man, seeing him for the first time,
focusing on his eyes, the trembling lip and the unmistak—
able fear and utter confusion of an innocent man.

Grant spins back to the aisle, meeting Fran's stunned
expression.

GRANT
It's not him...

Grant reaches across the seats, grabbing the computer,
yanking it towards him. As he does, the computer smashes
into the seat back, the battery pack splitting open, a
flood of glittering diamonds, cascading over Grant's leg
and onto the floor.

Grant drops the computer, his eyes whipping across the
sea of faces before him —— who is it?

INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT — DAY 231

Cahill inching closer to the points with the plastic
strip.

INT. MAIN CABIN AREA — DAY 232

In the next section aft, alerted by the commotion, the
Terrorist Guard has moved through the work station and
seeing Grant's face in profile, raises his weapon to fire,
Grant still unaware of his presence.

Suddenly, the Air Marshal springs like a jack—in—the—box
from his seat, a .357 revolver held in combat stance.
Grant reacts, raising his weapon...

AIR MARSHAL
(shouting)
Behind you!

The Marshal FIRES, the terrorist guard ripped off his
feet, slammed into the seats, but FIRING back as he falls,
the Marshal hit, spinning, dropping. Chaos spreads
through the passengers, Grant still probing, searching the
faces before him. Suddenly his eyes make contact and lock
onto a face, a man seated in an aisle seat on the opposite
side of the plane and several rows forward...

weapon, shouting...

GRANT
Freeze!

Suddenly, like a flushed quail, the man panics, reaching
for something wedged between his jacket and the seat. But
his fingers fumble the object, which falls to the floor.

GRANT
Everybody, down!

As the man lurches to the floor, Grant FIRES, the BULLET
EXPLODING into the headrest. Grant plants his foot on
an armrest and in a wild, crawling scramble across the
center section seats, races desperately to beat the man
to the detonator.

On the floor, the sleeper, with trembling hands, flips
open the lid to a six—inch square calculator—like device,
rapidly punching in a four—digit code.

Grant, in a last desperate lunge, goes airborne in SLOW
MOTION, twisting and FIRING as he clears the last row of

seats, delivering a fatal head shot to the sleeper, just
as the sleeper's finger touches the detonation switch!

him backwards into the cockpit. With his other hand, Rat
FIRES a TASER UNIT into the chest of the other Terrorist,
electrocuting him.

INT. MAIN CABIN — DUSK 238

Charlie drops through the hole in the ceiling in
silhouette, landing in a crouch as the lights flash back
on.

Charlie recovers and stands, FIRING his hand SHOTGUN,
point—blank at the Terrorist in the aisleway, spinning
to take out another with his pistol. The Terrorist is
knocked sideways against the seats, his finger closing
on the trigger of his AUTOMATIC WEAPON, letting loose a
BURST which rakes across the cabin, SHATTERING TWO
WINDOWS.

An incredible EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH the PLANE as the
aircraft depressurizes, a portion of the hull is ripped
away like paper, in an instant two rows of seats vanishing
in a gaping hole...

Oxygen masks drop as overhead bins erupt, the cabin
becoming a hurricane of RUSHING WIND, the plane plummet—
ing into a steep dive, the air filled with paper, debris,
blankets, food trays, luggage and other flying objects.

Charlie is sucked off his feet and slammed against the
wall near the gaping hole where the windows used to be.

stretcher plunging backwards into the container at a near

bomb, his good arm pinned beneath his body. Cappy looks
up at the bomb as we:

ZOOM IN CLOSE ON the bomb, the plastic straw, still
trapped between the points by a mere millimeter beginning
to vibrate.

Inches from Cappy's eyes the plastic straw vibrating
out—of—control. Another second...

Sweat pouring from his face, Cappy strains to free his
bandaged arm from the tape holding it to his chest. He
moves the clumsy bandage towards the strib. Three inches
away, it seems like a mile. Cappy struggles, wide—eyed,
his hand moving a fraction of an inch further, but shaking
so hard he's in danger of knocking the strip from the
points.

He moves closer. Unable to grasp the strip, Cappy lines

up his bandaged hand, aiming at the strip. With the last
of his strength he lunges, pushing the strip between the

points. Cappy collapses.

INT. REAR OF PLANE — DUSK 245

Grant, crawling over the seats, pulling himself along,
nearly swimming over the passengers, trying to get to the
Terrorist in the rear of the plane.

The Terrorist gets to his feet, seeing Grant. He levels
his weapon but Grant leaps, grabbing the Terrorist, a
struggle ensuing for control of the weapon.

The pressure is now beginning to stabilize as Baker
fights his way to his feet. He makes his way to Charlie,
lying in the aisle, nearly unconscious.

Baker moves through the work station heading for the rear

smashes Baker across the face with his pistol, knocking
him to the floor.

In the rear of the plane, Ali Hassan can see the fight in

Grant, struggling to tear the weapon from the Terrorist's
hands. As they spin around, the WEAPON FIRES, a burst
ripping through the ceiling.

With a final effort, Grant knees the Terrorist in the
groin, twice, ripping the weapon free, using it to
bludgeon the Terrorist to the floor. Grant falls as well,
the weapon flying from his hands, lodging under a seat.

Grant, exhausted, nearly sick, struggles to his feet and
turns. Facing him is Ali Hassan, his face wild and
crazed. He raises his weapon, leveling it at Grant...

But his eyes go wide in shock as several SHOTS RING OUT.
Blood spurts from Hassan's mouth as he turns and falls,
face down.

Standing behind him is Fran, Grant's .22 automatic in
her hand. She looks at the gun, her hand beginning to
tremble.

Grant takes the weapon, bending to pick up Ali Hassan's
weapon as well. As Grant rolls over the body...

Ali laughs, a grenade in his hand. He pulls the pin.
Instinctively, Grant lunges, his hand grabbing Ali's,
holding it and the grenade handle closed.

A desperate struggle ensues, Ali fighting to release the
grenade, Grant to keep control of Ali's hand while trying
to subdue him. As they slam against the outer bulkhead,
Grant looks up, seeing an emergency exit door. Wrestling
himself into position, Grant kicks upward with all of his
strength, the release handle for the door flying, the
door pivoting outward as the emergency slide, in an
explosion of air, extends...

Grant breaks free, shoving Ali backwards. As Ali flies
out the door, making a desperate grab for the slide, he
drops the grenade, spoon flying, the grenade wedging in
the doorway.

Ali, arms entangled in a safety line, is ripped to the
end of the slide, flapping wildly in the wind.

Grant kicks the grenade, dislodging it from the doorframe,
the grenade skittering down the slide. Ali screams...

CAHILL

Cahill moves alongside Cappy, struggling to push the

a scrambler telephone, computer keyboard and screen.
Grant turns it on, typing in an access code. On the
