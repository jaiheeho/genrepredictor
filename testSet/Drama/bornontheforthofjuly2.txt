Silence, surreal.

JULY 4, PARADE -.MASSAPEQUA, barking back to the nighttime parade
sequence when Ron was a young boy. But now it is a harsh summer
sun - DAY - burnt out streets. A glare...and the silence.

THE CROWD shading its eyes from the glare - a tension in the air.

THE HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND is almost past...a DRUM FX in the
distance...something coming up the street. ‘

THE SOFT PURR‘of’a big CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE moving down Broadway,
PX of this SOUND strOng in surrounding SILENCE as we MOVE UP into
the car and see a LEGION DRIVER and LEGION COMMANDER, both in
peaked hats, waving to the crowd... and MOVING

... into the back seat, RON looking out at the crowd with a tight
nervous smile. A flag is draped across the back of.the car...

PAST THE 7_& 11 STORE - TEENAGERS coming in and out with
purchases, pointing...PAST THE CROWD, silent, few of them waving,
just staring at RON like a ghost come back from the dead - uneasy;
an aquarium feeling with the yellows of the sun bouncing off the
Massapequa architecture...PAST Sparky the Barber's ("Unisex ‘
Haircuts Now $4.96") and SPARKY 1n hlS barber's uniform waving ...

The town has truly changed -- 'modernized, more commercial, more
signs, the sixties finally crawling over the fifties...

RON drinking more mezcal as he tries to scrawl a postcard home. He
tears it up...pulls out a rumpled old letter he’s never sent; -
folded into little.parts from his address book...he unfolds it..
nearby we notice copies of "Jenny Got His Gun", "All Quiet on the
Western Front", a biography Of‘Gandhi...

 

His eyes reading the old letter, water marked.

INSERT: LETTER: "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Wilsonz.;I don’t know how to
tell you this. I knew your son in Vietnam. He was..."

He stops...something defeated in his eyes. He knows he will never
send this letter... he ponders it as the VOICE from the other side
of the wall becomes onerous...

strange cosmic dance across time...Interchangeable. He dead.
Wilson alive. His ghost calling from the grave. "Remember me.

in Vain, Stumbling Confusion. Remember Me..." And_RON is now
hearing the SOUNDS of that last struggle on the windy grey beaches
of Vietnam and the obscene CRASH of SHOTS and the gnashing,
struggling SOUNDS of MEN screaming and dying...and WILSON'S
BREATHING through his windpipe, gurgling in his own fetid blood as
he dies, his big eyes staring up...as he rolls over and dies...and

heads: STOP THE WAR - VIETNAM VETERANS AGAINST THE WAR -— "hurray!

wanna see us, they wanna hide us because
they’ve lied and cheated to us for so
long -- but we're not gonna run away and hide
.anymore, we’re going to win because we LOVE
this country. We love this country more
than they could ever know. We fought for it,
we gave our bodies because we loved it and
believed in everything it stood for and
tonight we’re-ashamed of it, and.we’ve come ,
from all the little towns, thousands of us to
get this country back again, to make it
whole again. Truth, honesty, integrity -
this_is the lost American dream here tonight,
and we're onna ta e it bac !

INTERCUT CLIP - NIXON I ' 106

Talking about Vietnam. The completely counter argument about
ideals, patriotism, ideology - the basis of the Cold War. Cognent,
coherent, something we’ve all heard before -— and totally false to
its core. - ~ . . .

INTERCUT RON -- to the cameras. (He has become a professional 107 g
orator now, his voice and eyes and overall intenSIty the same RON
but older now, polished, a political leader.

RON ‘
We're never never gonna let the people of
the United States forget that war, because
the moment we do, there's gonna be another
war and anotherl and another, that’s why
we’re gonna be there for the rest of our 7
lives telling you that the war happened, it
just wasn’t_some nightmare, it happened and
you’re not gonna sweep it under the rug
because you didn't like the ratings like some
television show...this wheelchair...this
steel is your Memorial day on wheels, your
yankee doodle...

THE SUBTITLE READS: "FOUR YEARS LATER - THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL
CONVENTION - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NEW YORK CITY, JULY 15, 1976"

From a very wide shot of the Convention, where RON is introduced by
the LOUDSPEAKER, we cut to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of RON as he starts
his address, pulling out to reveal his face...the podium..the
flags...as he speaks...

. RON
I am the living death. You're Memorial Day
on wheels. I am your Yankee Doodle Dandy.
Your John Wayne come home. Your Fourth of
July firecracker Exploding in the grave..._
Twelve years ago when I was 18 years old, I
left Massapequa, Long Island and joined the..
United States Marines...I wanted to serve my
country...I wanted to be a good American...
I couldn't wait to fight my first war, and I
went with the others like our fathers before
us with hope in our hearts and dreams of

great victory... . -

Blending into the MUSIC THEME now...of tragedy overcome. Of life
renewed... '

The music is joyous as we can cut to a series of SHOTS of the
Veterans marching down Manhattan streets in their 1984 Welcome Home
Parade —- and the real RON KOVIC as he is now in 1988 -- still
fighting for "Truth, Justice, and the American Way".
