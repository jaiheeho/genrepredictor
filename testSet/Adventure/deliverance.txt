EXT. DAM PROJECT (HELICOPTER) DAY

A long high view of a gap between two mountains which is
gradually being dammed. An endless convoy of trucks winds'
up a temporary road to the dam, each tips its load of rock
and rubble, then turns down again. A deep wooded valley
is slowly being walled-up.

At the base of the dam a silver thread of river still escapes
through an open sluice-gate. A huge billboard proclaims

'The Cahulawassee Dam Project' and shows an artist's im-
pression of the finiShed Dam and an idyllic lake behind it.

MAIN TITLES BEGIN.

EXT. CAHULAWASSEE RIVER DAY

Follow the river up stream from the dam through tall secret
woods and naked rock faces, up the white water of angry
rapids, across still deep pools and finally to a road
bridge where a decrepit, small Southern town straddles its
banks. Move in closer to a clump of trees by the riverside
and on through the trees to reveal an old cemetery where

‘men are digging up graves, disinterring the dead. Rotting

coffins are piled on to a truck, catafalques are broken
asunder, head stones piled up in neat'stacks like sliced
bread. ' ‘ '

TITLES CONCLUDE.

EXT. FIELD ARCHERY RANGE DUSK

The face of ED GENTRY in profile: an indoor-desk man in
early middleeage, flesh a little soft. He is wearing a
bushhat and shooting arrows. The bow string appears, drawn
back and pressed into the check by the fingers of his right
hand.

The arrow lies across his face, the feathers rasping against
the bristles of his jowl. His eye lines up behind a curibus
orange peephole in the bow-string, far-focusing. The nice,
open, suburban American face contort: in the act of con-
centration, becoming animal and a little frightening.

Then the fingers relax and the arrow is simply no longer
there. The face falls back to what it was°

LEWIS MEDLOCK's head comes into view alongside and just
behind ED's. He glances off at the unseen target and then
at ED. LEWIS has a powerful, ascetic face with bright alert
eyes that might be just a little manic.

(CONTINUED)

 

3 (Cont.)

LEWIS '
A little high. Eleven o'clock.

ED draws another arrow, his face again transfigured by the
power of full draw. Still the target is unseen, only the
faces of the two men visible.

He stays a long time at full-draw. He starts to shake and-
the arrow rips away, flying out of the bow. ED curses.

' ED
Why does that happen, Lewis?

LEWIS
It happens.

LEWIS takes ED‘s_place, knocking an arrow. ED shakes his
head disgusted.

LEWIS
Draw hysteria. You either conquer
it and make it work for you, or it
destroys you as an archer.

LEWIS draws, holding the bow high and bringing it down on
to the target, revealing a glimpse of an awesome bicep.

. He is confident, calm, mystical. ED‘s look is amused,

affectionate, but definitely impressed.

LEWIS shoots an arrow beautifully, rhythmically, with a
perfect tranquil follow—through.

He finishes and the TWO MEN walk towards the target re-
vealing themselves fully for the first time, also the range.
Field archery is something like golf, a series of targets

at different'distances set amongst trees and brush. This

lone has been artifically developed on wasteland in the

city itself. It is a little patch of wild woods hemmed in

.on one side by an elevated freeway, on the others, by

railway sidings and indeterminate industrial buildings.

The targets are pinned to bales of straw and this one is

in the shape of a paper deer. They examine their shots

and pull out the arrows. The paper deer and the city
looming over them makes the archery seem very tame, a faint
echo of what it once mean: to hunters and warriors.

LEWIS straightens up as though suddenly aware of this,
looking round at the range with some contempt, his power—
ful chest framed against the freeway.

- LEWIS
(intoning it)
The Cahulawassee River: Wait till
you see it, Ed. I tell you, it's
wild and beautiful.

He speaks softly, his voice hypnotic. He looks off into
the distance as though he can see the river and ED follows
his eyeline towards the city that is lighting up for the
night.

LEWIS
When you get that white water under
you, things change, and all of this
is washed away.

Then breaking off, moving away, he says mockingly over his
shoulder.

LEWIS
And they‘ve got deer up there, Ed,
and they‘re made of meat instead
of paper.

ED follows him, laughing.

INT./EXT. RESTAURANT BAR ATLANTA DAY

LEWIS and ED have been lunching or drinking beer with two
other men, BOBBY and DREW. All four are in their late
thirties or early forties.

They wear lightweight business suits, all but LEWIS who
has on an expensive sports shirt.

They are milling around the cash desk, paying the tab,
talking and laughing.

BOBBY
But we know nothing about canoeing.
Lewis.

They spill out of the door.‘

. LEWIS
(plausible and
persuasive)
There's nothing to it. We leave
Friday morning at first light and
we'll be back on Sunday in time to
catch the last half of the TV pro game.

5. m. ARCADE - _‘ ‘ DAY

They amble with the crowd along a sunken arcade. The city
roads and sidewalks cross above them.

BOBBY
.... but shooting ranidsi

LEWIS
Sure. Itis the second best sen-
sation in the world.

They start up a spiral of steps, up to street level. The
impression is of rivers of people flowing above them,
below them, around them. ‘

. DREW
(poking fun at Lewis)
The Vanishing Wilderness, huh?

LEWIS
(relentless)
This is. When the dam at Aintry is
Tinished, the water'll back up and
the riveris going to disappear for
ever. It!s our last chance to see it.

6. EXT. PEACHTREE STREET ATLANTA DAY

They bob up into the blazing sun. The black glass cire
cular tower of the Regency Hyatt House Hotel dominates

the street. Drab typists and flabby business men thread
their way back to the office blocks over the hot sidewalks.
The street is snarled with traffic, choked with exhaust
fumes. Up the street there has been a minor accident.

DREW
(the stifling crowd
deciding him)
Hell, let's take it then.

BOBBY
Why not?

ED watches all this, the dead faces of the crowd, the mean
of the traffic: LEWIS sucking them all into his scheme.
He is evidently oppressed by it but does nothing about it,
too lethargic perhaps. His eye moves to the black glass
tower, the city reflected and gramented in its facets.

DREW
(0.8.)
I've got to go.

7. INT. ED'S OFFICE - DAY

9.

It is modern. tasteful. There are some very good action
portraits of his wife and son on the wall with one or two
framed art director awards. His desk is strewn with roughs.
drawings, samples of lettering, half-finished comps. and
prominently, layouts for an ad for Kitt ‘n Britches. It

is a drawing of a girl in nothing but panties holding a
kitten and looking back over her shoulder.

ED looks at none of this but stands motionless. lethargic
at the enormous window that makes up the outer wall. He
is staring at the same round. black tower which is much
closer now, just across the street. It throws back its
broken, kaleidoscopic view of the city.

The ‘phone rings. Without moving his eyes from the tower.
he answers it.

ED
You’re all ready back there?
I'll be down in a second.

He puts down the 'phone, takes a deep breath. exhales it
sharply, and goes out or his door. carrying the Kitt 7n
Britches layouts.

INT.V ADVERTISING STUDIO DAY

ED comes out of his private office and walks down the length
of.a large open-bay studio where some of the commercial
artists are working.or laughing or talking.

'ED.assumes the air of dynamic.executive and his employees

smile Or nod to him familiarly, but get back to their work
too. ED enters a door at the end of the room.

INT. PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO DAY

The model. in a black and white checked robe. is sitting

in a camp chair. An older woman, obviously an employee. is
holding a kitten. Two or three men are bustling about under
the lights. They clear away newspapers from the place where
the model will stand to be photographed. They are incredibly
serious and intense as only men doing something fundamentally
trivial, can be.

The model stands on the chalk marks and a girl assistant
takes her robe. .

The model is revealed. wearing~only the Kitt 'n Britches.
ED's mouth opens and he sucks in breath. There is a

‘my God9 look in his face. She is brown and freckled,
shapely but muscular. but above all fresh. a country girl.

Her arms are folded across her bare breasts. The woman
hands her the kitten. She takes it in one hand, and to
protect herself, simply holds her left breast in her hand
in a beautiful gesture. At the same time she turns and
catches ED's look. recognising the homage it pays her.

She smiles at him. not a simpering or coquettish look. but
in a simple act of private giving.

ED stretches out an arm and touches her shoulder with his
finger tips.

INT. ED'S BEDROOM DAWN

His wife. MARTHA. lies with her back facing ED. He stretches
out his hand and touches her shoulder in exactly the same
spot as he did the model girl. It might even be the model
girl at this point. MARTHA responds by turning towards him
with a movement that is entirely habitual. She has her

head wrapped in a kind of towel. the sort of protective
covering that sufferers from sinusitis wear. She does not
open her eyes. even when she speaks. They are both very
still. There is a faint tinkle. as of Chinese windebells.

MARTHA
Are you really going?
ED
I think so.
MARTHA

Can 1 do anything?

ED
Just one thing.

Her eyes open.

MARTHA
What time is it? Do we have time?

ED

have time.

to read him, but he shuts her out° She pulls a pillow
down to her pelvis then turns slowly on to its burying
her face.in the bed.

ED crawls to her, and over her, looking down at her back.

The MODEL GIRL turnsp smiling, taking her breast in her
hand.

INT; en's LIVING ROOM DAY

LEWIS, ready for the woods, stands.framed in the open back
door. He looks in. grinning. a little crazily. At first ~
it seems he might be watching ED and MARTHA in bed; but
then ED appears, dressed, with his bow in his hands knife
and rope on his belt.

LEWIS
(softly)
The sun’s coming up. Up north the
water’s running.

EXT. ED'S BACKYARD DAY

A long, curved aluminum canoe lies across the top of
LEWIS' stationwagon, blending into it in the early morning
half-light, transforming the familiar carushape. ED and
LEWIS climb in.

The back of the car is packed with equipment. tents and so
on, mostly in various shades of green. The car backs cut
into the deserted suburban street leaving MARTHA and DEANQ
Ed's son. huddled together, waving.

complex of revolving machinery and criss=cross lines of
Juddering bottles. His physical presence is like a challenge
to the machine.

LEWIS
Well, I think the machine is going
to fail.

DREW

Not this one. I hope. Not this

EXT. HIGHWAY , DAY

The cars with canoes on their tops drive through the ugly
clutter of the outskirts of the city, past drive- -ins,
motels, shopping centers, filling stations. The morning
traffic is going into the city as they head out.

INT. LEWIS' CAR ‘ ' DAY

LEWIS is driving. He holds the wheel at the top with
his hands crossed and his arms at full stretch, tensing
him against the seat.

LEWIS a
.... the human body. That's the
one thing you can't fake. No
way.

ED
Go ahead. Crucify yourself
lifting weights. I'm committed
to the machine. And America.

Outside on the highway the billboards, the electric
pylons, stride across the countryside proclaiming their
dominance.

LEWIS
-We took the wrong road. It's a
blind alley, believe me. It can't
last. It can't support its own
weight.

ED
Listen, Lewis, it will last as
long as we believe it will-last.
When enough guys like you stop
believing in it, then it will
collapse. It's a matter of faith.

LEWIS
-Everything's so fucked up, so
complicated... I wouldn't mind if
it all fell apart and we started
over.... And you know where I'd go?
Right where we're going now. It's

INT, CAR DAY

They go over a narrow bridge, the kind made from concrete
sections in the thirties. ED leans out of the window,
looking curiously at the river, The river seems placid and
narrow, undistinguished, rather uninteresting.

' ED
That it?

'HME
That's it. .

ED turns back to the river to conceal his disappointment from
'LEWIS.

EXT. CREE . DAY

The two cars pull into Oree° It is a disheartening place,

a typical remote small southern town. The woods and weed—
fields seem to grow right up to the edge of ito There are

no Negroes in evidence, for this is on the hills, and there
is no precedent. There is a town hall, the fire engine being
washed near it; a couple of gas stations, Graffit is
scrawled on a wall; 'STOP THEM DROWNING OUR LAND“. There are
several deserted and boarded up houses° .

EXT. GAS STATION DAY

LEWIS's car and the other pull into a Texaco station. LEWIS
pulls to a stop and kills the engine.- For a moment nothing
happens. Then_an OLD MAN appears at the window of the car

at LEWIS's side, leaning in. He is almost ridiculous country,
almost like a caricature, with an absurdly cocked straw hat
and trembling hands. Neither LEWIS nor ED knows quite what to
do with him.

LEWIS
Look. Let me ask you something.

Fill 'em up, will you?

,The OLD MAN takes the hose and with some clattering pushes

it into DREW’s caro They get out and stretch their limbs
and sniff the alien air. LEWIS spreads out his map on the
hood and bends over it. The OLD MAN finds himself staring
through the car's back window at DREW's guitar. He Jerks
his head back over his shoulder.

OLD MAN
Which a you plays guitar?

DREW looks over to him with a smile and a deprecatory shrug.

. OLD MAN
Lonniei Come on out "there,

DREW crosses to the OLD MAN and then follows his look back
into the dark depths of the Texaco station. The others,
having nothing stronger to focus their attention, turn to
look as a shy ALBINO BOY sidles out of the gloomy interior'
cradling a batt-er ed five-string banjo.

THE MEN suffer the acute discomfort of suburban dwellers
when confronted with the unseemly. The BOY7s white skin
looks luminous in the shadows. The OLD MAN laughs so tly
with pride and affection for THE BOY but also because he
feels that the advantage has shifted away from the CITY MEN.
LONNIE squints against the light, He is probably a half-wit,
likely from a :amily inbred to the point of imbecility and
Albinism. He smiles sweetly, expectantly through his squint

DREW looks over to the others for guidance, especially
to LEWIS, but they avoid his eyes, thoroughly confused.
LEWIS turns abruptly and folds his-map noisily.

DREW winds down the back window and takes out the guitar.
LDNNIE follows DREW closely, holding the banjo in whatever
position DREW assumes with his guitar. His cross eyes are
evident and rather endearing. He is innocent and ready.
DREW smiles at him, starts to tune his guitar, setting his-
finger picks. LONNIE follows him, dragging a homemade
capo up the neck of his banjo.

. DREW
igently, softly}
What are we going to play, Lonnie?

The OLD MAN is moving across to LEWISFS car, juddering the
hose into the tank with his trembling hands.

OLD MAN
(laughing and shouting)
Anything: Play anything.

DREW looks around again, not quite sure as to whether or

not he is going to contribute to a painful situation. Then
he makes up his mind, crosses one leg over the other as he
sits on the car hood and very carefully picks three notes in
the key of C.

(These are the first notes of a piece called Duelling Banjces
-as recorded by Mike Russo and Ross Brentano in Portland,
Oregon, in l9éh. The piece is one in which guitar, and

banjo "ansWer".each other by playing the same phrases
alternately).

The-OLD MAN, filling the tank, leans close to LEWIS, who
pulls away from him.

OLD MAN
Lonnie denit know anything but banJOe
picking, He ainlt never been is

DREW dives into the piece, figuring as one would suppose,
that he will go ahead and play the piece whether LONNIE
joins him or not. The OLD MAN watches with a sly, knowing
6" grin, waiting. LEWIS moves across breaking the OLD MAN’s
\ _ eyeline.

the OLD MAN just leans this way or that, restoring his view
of DREW and LONNIE over the mountain ranges of LEWIS's
musclesa

DREW stands upright, overwhelmed, totally happy. The others
are on the point of applause, and it erupts not in slapping
but in laughter.

DREW

The OLD MAN is laughing hard, with a strange stiff bending
movement, from the waist, and a look of 7I told you? on his
face. DREW, the bigmfaoed decent city man goes forward to

ED is still happy from the music, but LEWIS is hunched
forward, his hands crossed on the wheel, leaning on the car.

‘ LEWIS
We°ve got to get water under use

Oree has etered out into an occasional straggly buildingo

LEWIS spots a dilapidated garage ahead on the road, There

is a rough wooden house attached to it and a sign reading:

GRINER BROTHERS GARAGE° The two cars pull in° There 13 no
one about.

EXT. GRINER'S GARAGE ‘ -_ DAY

The whole place is almost drowning in the trees and weeds
around it. LEWIS leaps out of the car and knocks impatiently
on the door of the house which~is half-open. ED climbs out
and dutifully joins him, but BOBBY and DREW remain in their
car laughing soundlessly behind their windshield.

Through the open door a sliver of the house is visible, a
picture of Jesus, a few beercans on the floor and in the
deep shadows of the room an old woman is just visible in
silouette. A strange trick of light illuminates one of her
eyes. The eye and its pouch of aged skin seems to hang in-
dependently in space, unconnected to a body.

oLo WOMAN
Curse-you! Leave us be! Blust your
eyes! ‘

-This seems to be what she is saying although in fact her
speech is so country and slurred that the words are hard
to make out.

ED
_ Jesus!

LEWIS shrugs it off. There is the sound of muffled hammer-
ing from the garage at the side of the house.

LEWIS
(pointing towards the
garage)
Sounds like he's in there.

They move to the front door of the garage, but it is
padlocked.

LEWIS quickly threads a way to the rear of the garage through
a depressing wasteland of rusted farm implements, twisted
cars, abandoned pistonless engines.

At the back of the garage they find a door sagging open.
The sound of metal is much louder as it comes through the
opening.

Without any hesitation at all, LEWIS plunges into the dark-
ness of the garage. He is gone before ED makes up his mind
to follow him, but he does, and goes in too. For a moment,
there is nothing but the Junky back of the garage, and the

sound of metal being pounded.

INT. GRINER’S GARAGE ‘ ‘ DAY

It is quite dark at first, but soon objects emerge mysteri-
ously; a luminous green truck battery, cables and wires, a
distributor and carburetor on a wooden bench, an anvil, an
engine hoisted and dangling on a heavy greasy chain. Through
all these things LEWIS and ED thread their way, and before
them is disclosed a huge, country figure, a kind of red-
necked Thor, pounding the rim of a truck wheel laid on its
side on a bench°

Just as the figure is established in its half-light, an ex-
clamation comes from itg

GRINER
Shit fire: God Almi ht !

GRINER‘s figure bends,'apparently injured, doubles up and
makes for the dooro

ED immediately presses himself into the wall to allow the
agonised creature to pass into the light, but.LEWIS, his
powerful body silhouetted against the white light spilling
through the door, seems to block GRINER75 way. His position
forces GRINEH to look up at hima LEWIS having exacted this
penance turns, elegant as a matador, letting the huge bull
man passo LEWIS has just the glint of a smile, the look of

GRINER stands in the yard, spraddled-legged, holding his

hurt hand. He looks up at LEWIS and ED, and it is impossible
to tell as to whether the intense, terrible fierceness in his
face is coming from his pain, or from their intrusiono
Probably it is from botho He is an enormous country brutal-
looking man, with no humor in himo He suggests nothing but
brutality and stupidity. And enormous physical powero He

is dressed in overall pants and a sleeveless undershirt, a
train engineer’s cap, and army boots, which are blackened
with grease and unlaced.

LEWIS walks right up to him.

LEWIS
Can we do anything?

GRINER
(as though this were a perfectly
logical question he rejects)
Newo It ain t as bad as-I thought.

GRINER pulls out a dirty handkerchief and wraps it around
his hando

V LEWIS

We want to take a canoe trip down
the Cahulawassee, and we'd like for
our cars to be at Aintry when we get
there.day after tomorrow.

. GRINER
A canoe.trip?

LEWIS
That's right. A canoe trip.

GRINER
What the hail you want to fuck around
with that river for?

LEWIS
(firmly)
Because it's there.

This is for ED, and LEWIS throws him a look.

GRINER
It's there,‘all right. If you git
in there and canFt git out, you're
gonna wish it wudn‘t.

The situation is suddenly dangerous and out of hand.

ED glances at them both anxiously,

ED
Listen, Lewis. To hell with it.
Let's go back to town and play
golf,

LEWIS pays n6 attention to ED, but grinds GRINER with his

eyes.

LEWIS
(calmly and
deliberately, and
very distinctly)
Fifty, my ass.

LEWIS moves directly up to GRINER in what is quite obviously
a challenge to GRINER to do something physical, if he's of
a mind to.

ED pulls at LEWIS‘s arm.

ED
Lewis, Lewis. For God's sake.
Don't play games.

’ GRINER
How about forty?

LEWIS
(turning finally to Ed)
Are you good for ten?

ED h_ands a note to LEWIS who passes it on to GRINER with
some others.

GRINER
Good enough.

GRINER takes the bills and stuffs them in his pocket. He
melts into the rear of the house. .Lewis gives ED a quick

grin.
LEWIS and ED move around the garage, back to the car.

ED
(lowers his voice)
You reckon we'll ever see these cars
again?‘ This is a rough son-of-a-bitch.

As they come round to the front of the garage, DREW and
BOBBY appear noving tentatively towards them.

nervousness.

It's all fixed.

The others follow LEWIS and hang about him unoertainly by
his car. ‘

BOBBY
We heard this cussing and shouting.

- LEWIS
It's O.K.

BOBBY is about to go on, but looks up and steps. The others
also become circumspect and in the foreground the huge arms
and chests or the GRINER BROTEERS cross towards their run-
down pick-up truck followed by the eyes of the city men.

The pick-up truck pulls out and in the cab, besides the
BROTHERS, there is quite definitely a THIRD MAN. His
features are in shadow, there is just a suggestion of a
figure in a baseball cap - and nothing more.

EXT. ROAD ABOVE CREE ' , DAY

LEWIS'S car accelerates out in front of the truck with tyres
crying out. DREW is content to tag along behind.

INT. LEWIS'S CAR DAY
ED
Better let them show us.
LEWIS
(scornfully)

Hell, we know 'bout where it is.

Just ahead LEWIS sees a suggestion of a dirt road going off
to the_left. He slows the car round on to it. The car
jaws and bumps badly. ED tries not to look apprehensive
without quite succeeding.

LEWIS bumps and bangs down into a kind of hollow where the
road gives out°

Nothing is there but the rock-chimney of a burned down house.

ED

Why not just let them show us

LEWIS
You’re missing the whole point, Ed.

He hurls the car around on full lock and claws back to the
road where the truck and the other car wait. As LEWIS
comes alongside the pick-up, GRINER leans out of his cab.

. GRINER
Where you goin‘ city boy?

LEWIS
We'll get there.

GRINER
f Ain't nothin' but the biggest
river in the State.

0 ED hides a kind of smile, but LEWIS is undaunted, not angry
or rattled at all. He spurts forward again, the canoe
rattling and banging on the roof.

The land is flatter, and the road runs between stumps of

LEWIS

28. EXT. TRACK TO RIVER DAY ‘
i

A track leads off into.it. LEWIS drives in without slacken-
ing speed. The track immediately clips down a steep incline.
The road obviously doubles as a river bed at flood-time, its
surface gauged out and at the same time smoothed over.

ED braces himself against the dashboard. Bushes swirl at
the open windows of the car, flying in, then whipping out
again. The underside of the car drags and crunches on brush
and gravel.

Suddenly the car is stopped and the branches become still,
633 lying across ED'S chest.

Listen:

They keep perfectly still for a moment, swallowed in the
dark green belly of the forest.

Unmistakably, the sound of running water.

LEWIS grins and his grin widens as the sound seems to grow.
LEWIS is himself again.

LEWIS
YOu have to get lost before you
can find it.

They clamber out, LEWIS leaping, ED rather apprehensively.

, ED
You reckon there are any snakes
around here?

LEWIS
Plenty. Watch where you put your
feet.

ED catches a glimpse of himself in the rear window of the
station wagon, where the dark equipment inside makes the
window more like a mirror. He buckles on his Army web
belt with the big knife on it and the coil of green nylon
rope.

He pulls a wry face at himself which is meant to self-
mocking, as though he were putting himself on by acting this
way, -wearing these clothes, being here in the woods.

ED looks around for LEWIS, and doesn't find him° He looks
in this direction, then that. Finally he sees LEWIS momen-
tarily further down the slope.

ED scrambles after him - squeamishly, as though afraid of
getting his tennis shoes dirty, he crowhops, dodging the

pools of water, over to where LEWIS is peering at something
through a drapery of bushes and willows.

EXT. THE RIVER ’ , DAY

ED comes up to LEWIS, and LEWIS dramatically opens the
willows wider, revealing a leaf-framed View of the river°
The sound swells up.

The river is pretty, beautiful even - but not as wide as one

not threatening at all.

LEWIS
There it is. The real thing.

' ED
Pretty. Pretty indeed.

The willows swish back into place, closing off the View of
the stream.

EXT. EMBARKATION POINT DAY

BOBBY and LEWIS have the aluminium canoe on their backs
and stagger down to the water, leaves lashing this four-
legged headless beast.

THE GRINERS watch from their truck with derisive fascination.
making no attempt to help.

BOBBY and LEWIS lift the canoe down awkwardly into the water,
where ED takes it from them. The other canoe, the green
wooded one, is floating and loaded up already. ED holds the
canoe and is pushed deeper into the water, nearly to his
waist. He pulls his way back, but the mud holds him.

ED
It's got me.

LEWIS
What‘s got you. -

.ED
It:

LEWIS grins and turns back to loading and fussing with the
gear, as DREW gingerly hands down his guitar to ED.

DREW

Lewis Mediock. I done seen how he
drove these roads he don't know nothin'
about.

The gear is loaded now, the tents, the beer. the food, the
bedrolls, the bows and arrows.

LEWIS and BOBBY climb into the other canoe wearing their

life Jackets. BOBBY is incredibly awkward, WIS easy
and competent. (CCIFI‘TUTD)

Deep in the woods, the sound of a car starting.

BOBBY
I‘ll bet they can't get the cars
back up that hill.

DREW and ED are strapping on their life-jackets.

DREW
That's a nice thOught.

BOBBY picks up his paddle gingerly and throws a somewhat
desperate look over his shoulder as LEWIS pushes away from
the bank.

BOBBY
What the hell are we going to do
if We come off this river and
there's no cars down at what's-its-

name?
_ LEWIS

They'll be there. Don't worry about
8 things:

LEWIS drives the canoe out with long sweeps while BOBBY
holds his paddle uncertainly.

EXT. THE RIVER ‘ _ DAY

DREW and ED settle in awkwardly and push off. DREW picks
up his paddle and looks at it uncertainly. He makes a
practise stroke through the air.

DREW
This.... how you hold this thing?

ED struggling himself, alternately paddling and pushing at
the mud.

ED
You hold it.... like you hold it.

The water is fairly placid and slow here, but moving jhst

the same. They feel the river take hold of the canoes, take
them over. Just the sound of the water. Trees hang over the
river, holding back the sun, turning the water inky.

(CONTINUED)

 

26.

32.

LEWIS and BOBBY have got ahead, while ED and DREW shift
about and experiment with their paddles, laughing at their
awkwardness just like suburban fathers on a beating lake
in the park.

EXT. GENTLE RAPIDS DAY

The water quickens a little, and the speed of the canoe
visibly picks up. So far, ED and DREW are doing all right,
and_ they begin to know it. They are getting a rudimentary
sense of what they need to do.

- ED
Try a stronger pull. I think we're
getting the hang of it.

A broader expanse of the river opens in front of them. The
other canoe is still well ahead. The river is not particu-
larly rough here, but the part before them is a little
rougher than at the place where they put in.

ED and DREW manoeuvre through some lively, interesting but
not dangerous water, none of it white, but urgent and
vigorous.

Then they run one little stretch that is very slightly
dangerous, where the water begins to foam up, and they make
it nicely.

DREW turns backward to ED as much as he is able to do.

DREW
Hey, hey: How about this:

ED
(pleased)
This is some kind of all right,
huh?

They go along, in calmer water now. ED ploughs easily along,
enjoying things.

DREW
Well, for god's sake! What's
wrong up there, Tarzan?

Way ahead, the other canoe is swung broadside to the current.
The action of LEWIS and BOBBY in the other canoe is con-
fused and even a little desperate. The canoe is turning all
the way around, and begins to travel downstream backward.

DREW turns around, again only so much as he is able to in
his position, and he is laughing sincerely and sympathetical-

Ed is more concerned about the Others, but he smiles too, and
shakes his head ruefully, as though he expected this.

They are catching up with the'green canoe, as LEWIS tries to
bring the bow around.

LEWIS
(to Bobby, and a
little impatiently)
Let me do it: Take your paddle out
of thE'water and I'll bring it
around.

.He doesn't though. Just as the bow is beginning to swing I

downstrream, they drift on to a couple of big rocks and hang
there. LEWIS hunches in his seat, trying to get the canoe
off the rocks that way, doesn't succeed, then steps out into
the water, which comes up to his thigh. He rights the canoe
by brute force just as ED and DREW come alongsideo They
move into the lead and LEWIS clambers back in and sets off
again.

EXT. CREE BRIDGE DAY

As they pass under the bridge, one or two PEOPLE look down
at them, watching impassively. DREW spots the ALBINO BOY
amongst them. He waves up enthusiastically and getting no
answer from THE BOY, holds his paddle like a guitar and
pretends to play it. THE BOY stares but makes no response.

They pass under the bridge. DREW turns and looks back. THE
BOY has crossed over and still watches them from the other
side of the bridge.A

' DREW
Spooky kid.

They move through the part of the river lying directly under A
the town:of Oree° It is evidently used as a kind of junk
heap where the townspeople throw away anything they don't
want. .

The river bed is littered with old tires, engines, wheels,
old refrigerators, cookers, and so on. There are also severa.
startlingly bright broken things of plastic: pitchers, water-

~ containers, and the like. ED looks down at an electric blue

plastic jar that catches the late afternoon sun and shoots
up a jarring artificial light.

ED looks around: something is making him uneasy without
his knowing what it is.

He'brings his paddle out of the water, and there is a feather
stuck to the end of it. '

ED peers intently at something in the river. He can't quite
make it out, but finally he does. It is a chicken head,
ludicrous and repulsive, spinning aimlessly in the water be—
side the canoe, turning over and over, fixing ED every now
and then with its open eye.

ED still gazes into the river while he paddles. The canoe
passes over a huge ghostly white underwater thing.

It is a big rock with a log wedged against it. Both rock and
log are covered with feathers, wavering, hairy, and repul-
sive in'a sort of uncanny representation of human nausea:,a
perfect image of this.

along, not worried

about a thing)
Man, yen got to get used to these
things! You're a big boy now:

_ ED

A little further down, to make things worse, an effluent pipe
issues into the river and soon they are riding on a river of
blood: chicken blood.

ED
(not able to contain
‘his disgust)
Je-sus!

DREW

(turning around as

well as he can, in

a manner which is

that of joking,

but not entirely)
What's the matter? Don't you like
fried chicken?

ED

EXT. STRETCH or RAPIDS ,‘ ' DAY

They go around a turn, and the river changes cempletely.
There is a long series of little rapids, lively and interest-
ing looking, stretching out of sight ahead.

DREW -
Well for the Lord's sake, would you
look at that; What do we do now?

They are delighted but apprehensive too,

ED
Lewis'says head right for the fastest
water. Try to keep us going right down
the middle, thrdugh the channel and be-
tween' the rocks. That' s all I know to do.

' DREW
’Ay, ayz Let's go there:

DREW digs in enthusiastically, the canoe picks up speed and
starts through the first of the rapids.

They are sucked in to battle with the river, trying to keep,
the canoe straight in the channel, trying to avoid running
over rocks.

During all this, ED is silent, working hard, but now and.then
DREW gives an exultant whoop, like a cowboy breaking a horse.

There is just the right mixture of exhilaration and danger.
DREW and ED are equal to coping with this stretch of the
river, but only just barely. There is a time when they just

"about capsize° They ship some water, and DREW calls out Uh-

oh' But somehow they right the canoe and continue. At the last
place on this stretch, they go right over a big boulder and
come down on the river with a tremendous WHUMP.

The rapids give way to calmer water° DREW and ED adjust them-
selves in their seats, and re-arrange the equipment which has-
been shaken loose and out of place°

DREW
'Old Lewis, by damn; He knows something:
ED
That was sOme ride, eh?
DREW
You better believe it was some ride:
You 0.K.?
ED

Pretty good. Yes, sir: Sure am£

They back paddle and swing around to get a view of LEWIS and
BOBBY careering through the rapids. They do pretty well, too.

LEWIS drives his canoe up alonside the other one with long
strokes. He has taken it in a very blase way but BOBBY is
honestly excited and thrilled.

BOBBY
Wow: It's better than Disneyland.
DREW
Wow's right.
ED
(to Lewis)

Don't you think we ought to make camp
pretty soon?

'. LEWIS
Yeah, I do. I'm afraid if we go any
farther the banks might begin to get
“too high for us to get out on.

EXT. CAMP SITE NIGHT

It is now very dark, and a couple of flashlights have been
hung in a bush so as to provide an area of concentrated light
This device renders various effects of light and dark and
mood and tone, as one after the other of the men passes
through this lit-up area, stays in it for a moment, then
melts back into the general dark.

The upcast light of the flashlights gives unexpected quali—
ties to the faces of these men. It makes BOBBY look vaguely
Oriental and DREW'S face more pitted, as the shadow adheres
to his face. Only LEWIS is instantly recognizable, though
changed somewhat too° He looks more determined and author-
ative than ever, with also an admixture of ruthlessness that
does not show up so.well by daylight.

There is no sound during this eXcept single notes picked out
on DREW‘S guitar.

DREW is now tuning his guitar in earnest, using both the
regular method and also harmonic tuning, which-gives a beau-
tiful bell-like sound.

BOBBY comes over to them and hands them a paper cup apiece,
and then pours a big drink of bourbon for each. He disap-
pears, and LEWIS takes a generous swallow as ED sips, then,
LEWIS moves to the fire and begins to encourage it Steaks
are frying. The fire picks up and casts its flickering,
insubstantial light over the scene.

ED goes and lies on the bank by himself, while LEWIS cooks.
DREW plays a soft chord, a minor.

- DREW
I've always wanted to do this, only
I didn't know it. -

He picks part of a very country-sounding blue-grass piece,
then breaks off.

DREW
It's woods music. Don't you think so?

ED
Suedm

He plays on, switching around, fragments of blues and blue-
grass, then a few chords of "Duelling Banjoes." He leaves
gaps for the banjo to answer, looking out into the woods, but
none comes. During the music BOBBY pours himself another
drink and ED one. He offers the bottle to DREW, but DREW
shakes his head,being happy with his music, and wanting
nothing else, nothing_to interfere with it.

LEWIS brings over dishes of the food he has cooked, and the
three of them eat with great relish while DREW continues to
play. . 1

DREW stops, and they all sit silently.

LEWIS
(in what is for
him a soft voice)
You know, we don‘t have too many more
years for this kind of thing.

ED
Oh. I guess not. But I can tell you. I’m
glad we came. I'm damned glad. This is
a great place to be, right now..The greatest.

They are relaxed, euphoric, except for LEWIS. He still has
an ear cooked for the voices of the night, the sounds of the
forest. He is watching out, he is ready. But this just
makes the others more secure and easy.

BOBBY
(a little drunk)
It's true Lewis, what you said. There‘s
_ something in the woods and the water
that we lost in the city.

We didn't lose it, we sold it.

LEWIS has been standing a little apart from the others. Now

' he raises his arm in a gesture which says keep still and be
quiet. They freeze in their stretching or stooping or croudr
ing postures and listen. The noises of the night amplify as
they strain to hear'- the creeks and cries, the sighing treem
all indecipherable to a blunt city ear.

LEWIS is absolutely motionless, yet coiled up, ready to
spring.

The ease and well-being drains out of them as the forest be-
comes threatening, full of menace. ‘

surprise. - . A

LEWIS surveys the camp site, the firelight licking the long
tree shadows. He is very calm.

EXT. CAMPING GROUND DAWN

The two tents lie under a shroud of mist which has come up
over the river and spilled out through the forest°

It is very still. ED slips out of his tent. He wears long
Johns the colour of fog and he is scarcely visible.

EXT. RAVINE ABOVE CAMP DAWN

As he begins to walk stealthily away from the tents, he re—
veals his bow in his right hand.

He moves up along the small ravine or draw that runs back
inland. He moves very cautiously, the bow always ready, but
there is a distinct feeling that he is play-acting. He
doesn’t really think he is going to come on any game.

He goes along like this for perhaps twenty or thirty careful
steps, until the land begins to rise and the fog, as a con—
sequence, starts to thin out.

ED is more visible now, a ridiculous figure in long under-
wear in the woods, and he, too, obviously feels himself to
be pretty absurd.‘

He turns around to start back down, somewhat angry with him-
self.

He is getting back into the river-fog now, when to the left.
there is a slight movement. He stops and peers as he tries

to make out what is causing it. Gradually it becomes appar-
ent that it is a little deer, a spike buck probably.

ED slowly raises the bow. scarcely daring to breathe, scarce;
believing in his luck. and not knowings really whether he
will actually ShOOL or note l-he orange frame Oi thread on
his bowstring comes back as he draws the bow, until it is
framing his eye . A great flush of excitement comes over ED
and he starts tc_tremble.

At first the sight is not on the deer, and he tries to frame
the animal 31 owly, very slowly. The deer is browsing, not

‘looking up. and ED brings him right to the center of the

blurred frame of string.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

35.

ED releases. But there is a quick but unmistakable knowleip
that he has botched the shot, after all that preparation.
His left hand, bow-hand, has jerked just as the shot went.

ED

God damn it.
He snatches loose another arrow from the bow—quiver. He
draws again. The deer, which has evidently jumped a little
farther away, watches him, but the peep sight is swinging
erratically, and doesn't frame the deer, but once or twice
almost does. The bow twangs as ED releases, and the deer
Jumps and soundlessly vanishes.

ED very deliberately throws the bow into a bush, just as a
golfer would toss a club.

ED
Well, that's that!

He retrieves the bow, and starts down, noisily, awkwardly,
not looking out for deer any more, and then he is back at

the tents. This mist is thinning out; it is by now almost
gone.

38, EXT. CAMP SITE . DAY

DREW is folding his bedroll. He laughs at the sight of ED

and he calls into one of the tents for BOBBY,who is irritably
dressing.

DREW

Hey, Bobby. Look what came out of
the forest.

BOBBY
(without humor

or irony)
Yeah.

LEWIS is making a fire with twigs. He turns and sees ED and
gives a sharp look at the two empty slots in the bow quiver.

Well, that's too bad. We could'a had

climbs and crumples into the bow.

ED looks at BOBBY apprehensively, then turns to call back to
LEWIS.‘

We’re gonna sail on out. We'll take
it-slow.

LEWIS is still packing gear into their canoe, while DREW
douses the campfire. '

When they get out into midstream it becomes evident as to
just how inept BOBBY is. He's in terrible shape physically,
as he is unco-ordinated, he is unwilling, he is disagreeable.

cold any good to dump in this river.

BOBBY
Fuck it. Let‘s get on with it. I'm
tired of this woods scene. I'm tired
of shitting in a hole in the ground.
This is for the Indians.

They go along for a while, not Speaking, and they make some-
what better progress.

EXT. THE RIVER ' DAY
The canoes cut through a dazzling silver sundrenched river.

The land gets wilder and more thickly-wooded. A heron
glides out low over the river lazily following its contours.

The river is placid and ED must paddle steadily to make pro-
gress. He keeps having to wipe sweat out of his eyes. He
squints at the Sunfilled river. He scoops up water and
rinses his face.

ED and BOBBY swallow beer.

The bow lies in the canoe and the river slides past it, with
its black and green, orange-feathered arrows, the heads
shining with deadly light,

LEWIS' canoe is out of sight as ED and BOBBY pass through
dense, fir forest - silent, mysterious, stifling.

A SNAKE slips into the water and swims with exactly the same
motion as crawling on land, across in front of the canoe,
then disappears, still in the same motion and at the same
speed, in the weeds on the other side.

BOBBY
(speaking back over
_ his shoulder)
Let's for God's sake not turn over here;

ED
No, buddy. We won't.

They are now getting awfully hot and tired. They finish the
last two beers of the six-pack° BOBBY throws his can care-
lessly into the river, and ED carefully holds his underwater
until it fills, and then lets it go down.

ED keeps shifting around uncomfortably, trying to ease his
back, his right hip. He keeps running his tongue around in-

Let‘s put in for a little while. This
is getting to me.

ED
(looking backward for
the other canoe and
not seeing it)
I'm for that. We can wait for the
Others to catch up. Maybe they’ve
got some more beer. -

l. EXT. RESTING PLACE DKY

They pull in and tie up to the bank, then climb out and sit
down, relieved to be in the_shade, BOBBY unties a hanker-
ehief from around his neck and leans down and sops it in the
river. _He sits beside ED, and they both peer upriver.

BOBBY
{squinting}
Wonder what the hell Lewis and Drew
are doing up :here, anyway.

Prob ab: 3' th: same thing we a re. Theysll
be along in a little while.

BOBBY ubs at his fees and me k wi-th the handkerchief. ED
gets up, and bends down and t;uches his toes a couple of
times to get the kinks out. He peers 'upri er once again,
doeant see anythin g. then turns back to say something to

'BOBBY

Befor— his gaze some: to rest on BOBBY, it stops on TWO MEN
at the edge 0 the woods shadowy and very silent. One of
them may have a gun; but this is not clear yet. '

THE MEN are still stepping forward, with a curious tiptoeing,
sideways walk, as though stepping around something that no
one but them can see is there.

If_there were ever any degenerate red-necks, they are these
two. One of them is about fifty-five, in overalls and a
filthy work shirt. He has a mangy whitish heard. The other
one, the man with the gun, is younger, and his toothlessness
should be the most obvious thing about him. He is not wear-
ing overalls, but just a ragged, dirty shirt and pants. They
keep coming.

The OLDER MAN comes up to ED, and gets himself ridiculously
close. The faces are no more than four or five inches apart.
There is silence, while the man looks fiercely and ED tries

-to think of something to say.

BEARDED MAN

of teeth, orange and broken)
What the hail you think you're doing?

ED
(as matter-of-factly
as he can.
Going down river. We've been going
since yesterday.

BEARDED MAN looks at TALL MAN, and something significant
seems to pass between them.

ED
(trying desperately
to tell his story)
We hope we can get to Aintry some time
late today or early tomorrow.

BEARDED MAN

BOBBY
(with something of his
smart-aleck city manner)
Sure. This river just runs one way,

BEARDED MAN
It goes... it goes.

TALL MAN

It.goes to Circle Gap. 'Bout fifty
miles.

close to Ed's again,
even closer than before)
Boy, you don't know where you are.

ED

Well, we're geing where the river's
going. We'll acme out somewhere,
I reckon.

 

With a very slight mave, the TALL MAN gets himself nearer
to BOBBY.

ED

convincing and

harmless and as

full of good will

toward strangers

as he can)
'Hell, we sure don't want any trouble.

ED
(genuinely outdone
by this time)
Look. I don't know what you're
doing, and I don’t care. It's not
any of my business.

The TALL MAN reaches over and feels BOBBY's arm, in a
strangely delicate gesture. BOBBY jerks back, and when
he does the barrel of the shotgun comes up, just a little,

but definitely.

ED
(as though the inter-
view were over)
We'd better get on with it. We've
got a long ways to go.

You ain't goin' nowhere.

The four of them go inland a few steps from the river, be-
hind a screen of bushes and weeds.

TALL MAN
Back up to that saplin'.

ED
(indicating a tree
with his raised hands)
This one?

ED backs up to a small tree, and the TALL MAN, working
quickly and expertly, takes off ED's web belt with the knife
and nylon rope on it, lets the belt out and puts it around
ED and the tree with the buckle on the other side of the
tree. He takes the knife out of the belt, slowly, and
stands looking at it with the shotgun pointing at BOBBY.

TALL MAN
(mock admiringly)
Look at that: I bet that'll shave

BEARDED MAN
Why'ont you try i-t? Looks like that'n's
got plenty of it. 'Cept on his head.

 

Very deliberately the TALL MAN takes hold of the zipper to
ED's coveralls, and, with a quick movement, like tearing
ED apart, he zips it down to the belt with which ED is tied
to the tree. .

BEARDED MAN .
Good God Almightyﬁ He's like a god-

TALL MAN scrapes across ED's chest with blade, and holds
up the knife with hair and a little blood on it.

Sharp, all right. Could be sharper,
but it's sharp.

TALL MAN begins to breathe faster, panting, and his face
takes on a malevolent expression. He looks, quitely liter-
ally, as if he would do anything: is just about to do it,
in fact.' Suddenly, and very unexpectedly he raises the
knife over his head and drives it down with all his might,
with a furious and final movement. It appears to have
entered ED.‘

ED responds in shocked horror as though he has been mortally
wounded. -But the knife has in fact been struck into the
tree right next to ED's head.

THE TWO MEN now converge on BOBBY. The BEARDED MAN takes
'BOBBY by the shoulder and turns him to face downstream.

BEARDED MAN

fact)
Now let‘s you just drop them pants.

Just take 'em right on off.

BOBBY

BEARDED MAN
Don't say nothin'. Just do it.

THE TALL MAN shoves at BOBBY's head with the gun, suddenly
and viciously. The TALL MAN's actions are abrupt and deadly.
BOBBY slowly unbuckles his belt and unbuttons his pants.

He takes them off, looking around ridiculously for a place
to put them down. .

BOBBY walks uncertainly over to a big rotten log on the
ground and stands there: just BOBBY and the log, in some
sort of as-yet-undivulged relationship.

TALL MAN
Now git on down crest it.

He puts the gun muzzle right under BOBBY’s right ear.

ED watches horrified, the knife stuck in the tree next to
his head, a little blood trickling from under his chin. 'He
shifts and gasps for breath against the tightness of the
belt.

The BEARDED MAN unfastens his pants while the TALL MAN
stands impassively over BOBBY, pointing the gun.

ED's face again,waiting to see and not wanting to, averting
his eyes as BOBBY's first scream comes. There is a note of
dreadful surprise in it. More screams come of animal pain,
becoming rhythmic.‘

ED looks straight before him now, his eyesdeadened and wihcu:

hope, not responding to the screams anymore.

Then his look changes, his focus shifts. His face takes on-

'an‘expression of unbelief and the beginnings of a fantastic

kind of hope.

Through a slit in a curtain of leaves is the green canoe .
with LEWIS and DREW in it. They both have their paddles out
of the water. Then the canes disappears, as though it had
never been. ED shakes his head as though he believes he *
may be hallucinating.

ED looks back toward the bushes, as the BEARDED MAN rises,

a little unsteadily, to his feet. There are no more screams.

The BEARDED MAN makes a long strange sigh, as he stands

‘there buttcning his pants. There is a glimpse of BOBBY

rolling in pain under the bushes.

After they reorganise themselves for a moment, the TALL MAN
and the BEARDED MAN, without§saying a word, turn from BOBBY
and advance with dreadful purpose toward the tree where ED
is tied. ED watches them come, step by step, the TALL MAN
still with the gun.

The BEARDED MAN goes around behind the tree. ED and the
tree jerk violently, and ED suddenly falls free. He almost
stumbles, but brings up quickly, for the gun-muzzle is Just
under his nose.

TALL MAN
You're hairy as a god-damned dog,
ain't you?

' ED
(gasping, resigned to
anything but having
his head blown off)
Some dogs, I suppose.

TALL MAN

Bearded Man)
Now what the hail ....

BEARDED MAN
Ain‘t no hair in his mouth.

TALL MAN
(with a terrible,
toothless grin)
That's the truth. Hold this on him.

The TALL MAN extends his hand with gun in it to the BEARDED
MAN, all the time still looking straight at ED. .

TALL MAN
(with deadly
seriousness)
Fall down on your knees boy. You
gonna do a little praying. And you
better pray good.

TALL MAN begins to unbutton his pantsu ED goes down slowly
to his knees, the BEARDED MAN gets ready to position himself
_to hold the gun on ED, the TALL MAN looaening his pants.

There is an odd sound, a kind of quick slap-snap: a sound
like a quick, sharp indrawn breath.

The BEARDED MAN makes a loud involuntary surprised gasp,
like that of a man with the wind knocked out of him unex-
pectedly. He does not yet look down.

ED looks sharply at the BEARDED MAN's face, and then quickly
at his chest. A foot and a half of bright red arrow is
protruding from the middle of it.

They all three hang motionless for a moment, too amazed to
act. The gun starts to fall from the BEARDED MAN'S hand.

ED is nearest it, and he grabs for it, clumsily but with the
strength of panic. The TALL MAN also reaches for it, and
even touches it briefly, but ED has a better grip, this is
instantaneously recognized by both of them, and then the
TALL MAN leaps away into the bushes and is gone. The leaves
do not even tremble where he disappears.

ED rises, transfigured by terror and by the turn events have
taken. He is beast-like with the power of having the gun.
He wraps the string the gun uses for a trigger around his
hand and swings the barrel to cover the woods and everything
in it: to be able to blast whatever will come.

BOBBY still tightly curled up in his private pain begins to
comprehend the situation has altered.

The BEARDED MAN is standing stock still, with his feet wide
apart. He reaches down with a trembling, broken—nailed ‘
hand and touches the shaft of the arrow delicately.

He falls to his knees and then to his side, rolling back

and forth, spitting and gritting his teeth. Then he gets,
with awful comic seriousness,-back onto his feet again, this
time with his lips red with blood and drooling saliva and-
blood. He turns toward the woods and takes a couple of‘halt=

'ing steps toward them, and then seems to change his mind

and turns back to ED, holding out one hand like an Old Testa=
ment prophet about to divulge a secret to one of the chosen.-

ED makes the decision to fire. He begins to pull OUt the
string, utter determination on his face.

But there is no need. Suddenly the BEARDED MAN falls,

partly on his face and partly on his side, his face coming
to rest on the tops of ED‘s w its tennis shoes. He has a
bubble of blood in his mouth, red as an apple. ‘

ED lowers the gunbarrel a little.

Lord God. Lord God.

ED looks down at the BEARDED MAN. The silver of the alumi—
nium arrow-shaft and the fancy blue-and-silver marking of
the white-feathered arrow stick out of his back.

ED peers into the woods, swinging the half-lowered gun back
and forth, and nothing else happens.

Then there is a faint stirring in the bushes. ED swings
towards it. LEWIS comes cautiously forward, another arrow
on the string, his -bow at the ready. He comes slowly into
the clearing. DREW is behind him, holding a canoa paddle
like a baseball bat.

LEWIS walks out betwaen-ED and BOBBY, and looks down at the
BEARDED MAN. He puts his bow—tip On a leaf and gazes at it,
about to say something.

LEWIS
(meditatively)
Well, now, how about this? I mean,
just...° how about this?

DREW moves to BOBBY and crouches down beside him. He puts
his hand on BOBBY7s shoulder, very sympathetic and gentle.
BOBBY glances at him with a look of gratitude. Finally

’ BOBBY gets painfully up, and DREW helps him. Dazed, furious

and incongruous, BOBBY picks up his pants and shorts, fum—
bling takes a handkerchief from a pocket, and goes back he-
hind the bushes.

Meanwhile, LEWIS leans on his bow and gazes out over the
river. When he speaks, it is decisively, but distant.

LEWIS
figured it was the only thing to do.

ED

all that)

it. I tell you I did. I thought sure

something like the sound the BEARDED MAN gave out when he

There is silence. LEWIS waits, c_onfidentl y, DREW is grim
and adamant, BOBBY is full of hatred, and ED is coming to
the all-important decision.

ED
(leaning out so as to
speak to Lewis around
Drew)
I'm with you.

The spell of debate and decision-making is ovar.
LEWIS gets down by the corpse again, all business this time.

LEWIS
All right then.

LEWIS drags the arrow-shaft out of the body slowly and
laboriously, broadhead first. He wipes off the worst of the
blood then, clips it into his bow—quiver, where it looks
just like the others, except that it is red.

ED takes his knife out of the sapling, puts it in the scab-
bard and buckles on the belt with the knife and the rope.

LEWIS, with silent signals, positions eath of the MEN to
carry the CORPSE. They are very awkward about it, with ED

. and DREW carrying the shoulders and LEWIS and BOBBY the feet-.

They begin to carry the BODY feet—foremost into the woods,
away from the river.
EXT. DENSE WOODS. _ DAY

They flounder in the-bushes, almost falling from time to
time, BOBBY cursing, and so on..

LEWIS's face is calm a-nd purposeful, and DREW keeps shaking
his head a.s though he simply cannot believe in this folly.

As the undergrowth thickens, branches whip back sudden' -y and

else; the only things to be heard from the FOUR MEN are ex-
clamations and an occasional startled curse.

With a sudden movement LEWIS shifts his part of the corpse
to ED and doubles back the way they have come He runs
orniching like an animal darting in and out of the trees.
He has drawn his knife.

The THREE MEN struggle on. ED grunting with his increased
burden.

After a moment LEWIS appears at his side, taking his share
of the weight again.

LEWIS
He's not following. But we‘ll make
sure there's no tracks. This way.

LEWIS leads them to the left where a creek is revealed. They
scramble into the muddy water and wade up it laboriously.

The forest here_has a funereal, swampy look. The MEN toil

along with the BODY. They are now absolutely covered and -
drenched with sweat, from the stifling, breathless quality

of this part of the woods. They climb but of the creek and
twist and turn among the trees, until there is a feeling of
utter lostness.

EXT. SWAMPY FOREST . DAY

Unexpectedly, LEWIS holds up a hand, and, following his
example, the others aid him in letting the corpse down onto

‘the ground.

LEWIS motions for ED, and ED steps up to him. In a kind of
silent ceremony....very ritualistic....LEWIS unclips the
death-arrow and hands it to ED, who takes it, not knowing
exactly what LEWIS wants him to do with it. He examines it
as he would any other arrow,'then hands it back to LEWIS.

They are next to a blue-black seepage of water like a sump

of some kind. As though he were competing in an-archery
tournament, LEWIS puts the arrow on the string of his bow and
draws it. .

In the act of drawing it he appears to aim up into the trees
and ED's eyes follow the projection that the arrow might
take. But very dramatically....LEWIS slowly brings it down
until the arrow is pointing directly at the swampy ground.

He holds the arrow at full draw for a long endless moment,
mesmerising the others in the tension he creates. He is ccn=
centrating utterly. He releases.

The death-arrow disappears into earth. It is perfect. He

is deep in what is almost a Zen—like ooncentration.. There is
no trace of the arrow. It might have gone a mile deep or
even penetrated the very heart of the earth itself.

LEWIS breaks his own spell by bending down to pick up the
corpse; the others follow his example. They struggle on with
it for a while.

LEWIS turns, pointing down directly underfoot. The MEN put
the body down.

EXT. BURIAL PLACE _ DAY

LEWIS falls to his knees and starts digging with his bare
hands. The others come down to the ground with him and start
digging too.

It is fairly easy work, and they do it gladly, even DREW, in
a kind of a frenzy to get rid of the body. They dig like
dogs, throwing dirt this way and that.

The self-absorbed efficiency of DREW, who is working harder
and getting more done than any of them, is very striking.
Their breathing is heavy and irregular in the ominous silence.

Finally, LEWIS stops digging. It is a very makeshift grave
indeed, with ferns growing around it. The body lies there

beside the digging men, serene and indifferent, and the gun
beside it. '

They stand up and regard their work. LEWIS solemnly nods his
head. DREW crosses himself. Then they roll the corpse in a
Very undignified way into the grave. LEWIS reaches back and
gets the gun. He puts it into the_grave, looks at his

But ED cannot resist searching the trees anxiously.

EXT. THE RESTING PLACE DAY

The FOUR MEN scramble into the two canoes and shove off.
They hastily rearrange their gear as they move out into the
current. They are desperate to be away. All except LEWIS
who is relaxed and seems almost reluctant to leave the place
where he killed THE MAN. He looks at it intently.

. LEWIS
It never happened. Think of it as
a dream.
BOBBY

here. - \
' ED
What's the plan, Lewis?
' ' mus
(soothingly)

Plan? Why we just paddle on down
to Aintree, pick up those cars and
go home. What else?

The river is transformed for them, ominous and threatening,
every dark opening in the trees a possible menace, every
turn in the river a dangerous event. They jerk their heads
from side to side; wild, hunted animal looks. ED and DREW
are together azain in the aluminium canoe while LEWIS and
BOBBY are in the heavy wooden one. ED and DREW get a little
ahead. ED brings his bow up close to him. ready. '

While all this is going on they have been moving into a
gorge. The roekwface rises and narrows in. the sound of the
river changes, reverberating, intensifying.

ED tries to speak to DREW but cannot get through to him. The

sound of the river as it comes back off the cliffswalls is
now such that the human voice can hardly be heard at all,
even when it shouts its loudest.

EXT. THE GORGE , ‘ DAY

ED glances to his left, and his gaze travels up the wall
awsomely, higher and higher, until he sees that the gorge is
at least a hundred and fifty feet high, or maybe even higher.
ED looks apprehensively at this, all the time in the tremen-
dous sound of the reverberating water.

The river is beginning to fall more abruptly. There are
more rapids and more rocks. ED and DREW are working hard to
keep the canoe going straight. They are covered with spray
and foam, the canoe pitches and bucks.

They come into a comparatively calm stretch between rapids,
and go around a turn. A long stretch of‘very rough water
lies ahead, going out of sight around another curve. It
looks awfully rough; too rough.

' ED
(screaming at the top
of his lungs) '
Let's go right down the middle. Give
me some speed, babyi

Something happens to DREW; it is impossible to tel what. He
shakes his head violently {but this might just be the canoe
bumping on a rock) and his paddle is whirled out of his hand
by the river.

He pitches over, or is thrown over or something. Whatever it
is, the canoe goes out of control. ED lets go of_his paddle
and grabs for the bow at his feet as his last act before the
canoe overturns in the boiling, angry, murderous water.

EXT. ' THE GREAT RAPIDS ' DAY

ED is part of the river, turning over and over, banging on
stones, sometimes out of the water and sometimes under it,
rushing along with unbelievable force.

Momentarily he surfaces facing back up river as LEWIS and
BOBBY founder helplessly on the first canoe.

LEWIS and BOBBY spill out on opposite sides, and the two
canoes roll over and over each other like logs, until the
wooden canoe bursts open on a rock.

ED struggles desperately with the water, trying to get his
feet forward of him. After several attemps, he succeeds. His
body elongates in the river. He has the bow, and he begins
to slither over moss-covered rocks on his back. He hits the
back of his head on one big rock, but then seems to get the
hang of it. There is a curious look of pained pleasure on
his face as he slides along, still alive.

A deeper turmoil of water sucks him under, despite the life—
jacket. -

Then the last of the rapids are ahead, and ED goes over them,
over a last big rock and down into calm water.

EXT. POOL AT BASE OF GORGE - DAY

ED floats, cradling the bow, in the slow water below the
falls: he is a tiny figure, idly turning in the aftermath
of the furious white water, down between the enormous wings
of the gorge-sides.

He lies back in his life-jacket as though on a bed. He is
groggily trying to assess his situation. He grimaces with
pain, and lifts his left hand out of the water. He has hold
of the arrows in the bow-quiver by the arrowheads themselves.
He lets go, and his palm is washed with blood.

ED clumsily tries to rearrange himself in the water: trying
to get into position to look upstream at the last of the
rapids he has just come down, trying to look for the others.
He keeps looking at the last rocks of the rapids, but can
see no sign of life.

A man flops over the rocks of the white water, completely
out of control, and he recognizes after a bit, that it is
BOBBY.

BOBBY starts to splash his way to the side. Through no
fault of his own, unhurt., Soon LEWIS is spewed'out of the
rapids, one hand holding his paddle and the other over his
face.

LEWIS writhes and twists in the water. ED moves towards
him°

LEWIS gets hold of ED's life-jacket or collar, and ED
struggles to get both of them to the bank. ED glances back
from time to time, looking for DREW.

ED and LEWIS reach the bank, where BOBBY leans out to help
them.

LEWIS crow-hops and gets himself onto a big rock, where he
collapses. ED goes to him and tries to make him comfortable.
LEWIS is still holding onto his face with a hand, his pain
obviously all but intolerable. ED bends down to him, for it
appears as though LEWIS is trying to say something.

LEWIS
(against the ever-
present river sound)
Drew was shot. I saw it. He's
dead. .

ED is stunned. Even in this condition, LEWIS has the power
to shake his equilibrium.. The roar of the rapids is deaf-
ening. They have to shout to be heard above it.

ED

Was that it? Something happened.
But I don't know. .Shit, Lewis,
what a mess you got us in to.

He gets up from LEWIS's side and turns uneasily to BOBBY.

ED
Let's try and find Drew.

He wades back into the water with that special revulsion
that it takes to get back into cold water once you have left
it. BOBBY follows him.

BOBBY
Shot?

ED
_He says.

They swim about somewhat aimlessly for a moment or two, then
something comes tumbling down the rapids. They both see it
and it awakes hope in them.

ED turns back to BOBBY, recovering his control as quickly as

he lost it.

They stand together in silence. ED with his hands on his hips,
looks up the gorge-side. LEWIS writhes on the ground under
them, and a muffled groan escapes him.

BOBBY
What are you going to do? I mean,
how will you find him?

ED .
If I get up there, I'm going to do just
exactly what I would do if I was him.
There are some rapids right below here,
and he won't want to shoot at us when
we're jumping and bobbing up and down°

same with the other.

EXT. CLIFF FACE - ' . - _ NIGHT

ED coils the nylon rope and_puts his left arm between the
bowstring and.the bow, with the arrowheads turned down. He
looks up the cliff one last time, then runs hard at it,
scrambles, pulls up, and works himself up onto a little ledge
about twelve or fifteen feet above the river. He turns around
and stands there, looking out over the water.

The moon has risen over the river. The last of the rapids
they have come down are on the right} on the left are the
rapids further downstream; ED watches the river for a moment,
mesmerised by its mystery.

He turns back to the cliff, tries some hand and foot positions,
and begins to inch up. ED'S hands grope, finding holds, his
feet doing the same. He begins to sweat and his breathing.gets
harsher. The cliff is getting steeper as it gets higher. He
is beginning to labor and strain for every inch, and his
breathing begins to sound more and more desperate.

He climbs up a kind of funnel where water trickles down from a
spring. He climbs by bracing himself in this lchimney’. The
water runs over him. He pauses for a moment and smiles at a
lone flower growing out of.the rock.

Now he reaches an absolute impasse: he can't go up any farther
and he canft go down. He can't go to the right or to the left.
He is trapped, terrified and helpless. There is absolutely
nothing he can do. He looks down, over his shoulder. There is
the bright moon-pit, and it must be a hundred and fifty feet
below him.‘ He turns back to the cliff, leaning his face
against it, sobbing, all control just about gone.

Suddenly he makes a lunge at the cliff....ug the cliff....his
hand catches on something. He gets hold of something with the
other hand, and there is a wild hepe in his face: the last
hope of all.

Ed pulls up, and gets himself into a kind of narrow crevice or
niche in the cliff. In doing this he almost loses the bow,

but manages just barely to save it. He stretches cut on the
floor of the niche, breathing heavily, and trembling. .t is

as though he were lying in a coffin, except that he is sweating
so heavily.

After'a while he props-up on one elbow and looks over the side
of the crevice, down at the river. He lies there stroking the
curves of the bow, looking down at the wild, Godlike and minds
less beauty of the river on fire with moonlight.

'2./ He lies watching the river intently.

ED has leaned out to see the view better and almost falls. The
bow slithers over the side and he Just manages to save it. He
jerks back. Slowly he feels the crevice above his head, and
around the top of it, to see what's there. Painfully he begins
to get himself together once more: to climb.

He gets a hold....a fairly good hold..q.on something and'drags
himself upward out of the crevice. He climbs in a kind of
trance, his fingers like independent beings crawl over the
surface hauling the body after them.

He is so high over the river that the scene is both awesome
and ridiculous. He is still inching up, and up, and up,

The cliff is not as steep as it was: things are going better.
ED begins to crawl on his knees. He slithers and wriggles
upward, and the sound of his breath is like that of a man who
sees that he might after all be able to do what he's trying to
do: might be able to do it, and probably will. There is a
kind of rage of incredible belief and joy in ED's breathing:
it is almost bestial. -

He looks up, and the enormously intense moon is right in his
,<?g§g face, coming down through a crack in the rock. He makes for
” \x’ the crack, gets into it, rises from his knees, stumbles forward
among rocks and bushes, sobbing with relief.

He looks down at his feet, amazed to discover he can walk.

51. EXT. CLIFF TOP NIGHT

He stands on the top of the cliff looking down at the enormous
mindless blazing of the moonlit river. He has made it, and his
attitude as he stands there is not completely mortal or even ‘
human. It'is more godlike, or demonic. But it is not quite - i
the face he's had before at all. ‘

ED examines the cliff top very carefully. He comes to a big
boulder with an open space that gives a perfect view of the
river below.

ED nods: he figures that this might indeed be the place.' He
moves around experimenting with positions. The ground is soft
and he leaves heavy tracks.

ED gets down at the very edge of the cliff in the prone
position for firing'a rifle. He sights an imaginary rifle
G? down on the river. He looks around. The woods are very thick
' just back off the little open space he's in. He goes back into
them, and ED selects a tree and climbs it with much labored
movement and a few slips.

EXT. TREEHIDE ' . . NIGHT

He opens the pine branches slowly with one hand, and looks out
on little open space, which is below him and about fifteen
yards away. '

He breaks one or two branches to make the view permanent. He
adjusts his feet and body then puts an arrow on the bow, gets
himself set,_and comes back to full draw. He does this two or
three times until he's satisfied. He then hangs the bow on
the limb and tries to get comfortable in the tree to wait for
the first light. He stares fixedly, without expression into
the 'tunnel' he will shoot down.

EXT. CLIFF TOP NIGHT TO DAY

The trees, river and cliff top, strong dark shapes in the
brilliant moonlight, now melt slowly into a flat grey dawn.

EXT. TREEHIDE DAY

He is dozing, in the tree, his head back against the bole.
The bow hangs beside his head, and a little light glints on
the two arrowheads.

Suddenly ED starts, almost falls, catches himself and looks
around with exhausted eyes. But he is awake enough to know
that the sun is just beginning to appear. He shakes his head
like a boxer trying to shake off a punch.

ED peers this way and that, trying to see a little more. He
blinks his eyes like a man who has not had anywhere nearly
enough sleep. He looks down into the sandy shelf. There is a
pair of feet - boots...standing on the shelf, barely inside
ED’s range of vision.

ED's face is pure terror. He keeps looking, and the feet on
the ground move until most of the whole man passes through
ED's line of sight and then out of it to the other, upriver,
side.l But he has seen enough to know that the MAN is carrying
a rif e.

ED cranes to see the MAN, but can't make him out again. Then
the feet appear on the other side of the tunnel of branches,
stop for a moment, then come right to the center of it and
stop. What ED can see of the MAN indicates that he is looking
at the ground, examining it, maybe. ED's tracks, of course,
are what he‘s looking at. Hardly daring to move, ED stretches
out for his bow, hanging on a branch. It creeks as he takes
hold of it. ED winces at the sounds he is making. His hands
tremble uncontrollably as he takes an arrow and strings it.
Inch by inch he levels the bow, then slowly pulls back the
string.

The vertical rectangle of the peep sight on.the string wavers
back...just as it did when ED hunted the deer. He holds at
full draw, fighting to control the trembling that racks his
whole body.

He adjusts the peep sight up and down, right and left, until
little by little, in the wavering peep sight, the MAN is framed.

Then with a shock, ED notices what THE MAN is doing: he is
getting the gun ready, and his eyes are following ED's tracks
straight to the tree. They reach the tree, and slowly begin

to rise from the ground. In a moment he is going to be looking
up through the tunnel into ED's face.

With a kind of strangled cry ED releases. The peep-sight snaps
away. Then all hell breaks loose.

The whole tree shakes violently, as thohgh a giant ax had
struck it and at the same time there is a tremendous explosion,
as the gun goes off in what had been utter silent concentration.
Then ED is falling through the tree, branches slapping at him,
turning, whirling about him. He cries out then crashes to the
ground with tremendous impact.

He is on the ground without his bow, not knowing quite what has
happened, shaken, terrified. He tries to move. He cries out
in pain, startingly, and as though he is discovering that he
has broken a leg, a rib, or something else. He raises his
head, cautiously.

He sees THE MAN with the gun staggering towards him. THE MAN
fires the gun at the tree, up into the branches. Then he
stops, swaying a little and looks right into ED‘s face. He
raises the gun to shoot again but fires into the ground just
in front of his feet. At the same moment, ED ducks down,
terrified. He crawls a few feet and after a moment carefully
raises his head again.

THE MAN is on his knees. He is turned sideways revealin for
the first time the arrow, almost its whole length, coming out
the back of his throat. It waggles horribly behind him. He,
is retching and the violence of his retching shakes the arrow
loose, and it falls from him.

ED watches with horrified fascination.

‘ » ED
Die: My God: Die, die:

ED puts his head back down and is still, apparently unconscious.
Then he slowly raises himself to do something, but this time it
is not to look at the dying man, but at himself.

He looks down at his side and it has an arrow sticking through
it. Still attached to the arrow by the lower part of the bow-
quiver, is the broken DOW. (CONTINUED)

ED puts his head down once more, trying to organize
himself, to find what to do. Finally, he pulls himself
to a sitting position and cautiously, with great,
obvious pain, tries to pull the arrow out of his side.

He can't, and he sees he can't. With great effort he
pulls the big knife out of the scabbard...and cuts
away the material from the flying suit he's wearing
from around the arrow. He tries in a gingerly way to
out the arrow out. Then he seizes the knife in both
hands and drives it down. He explodes in a scream...-
something like BOBBY's in the rape scene....and the
knife falls ringing on stone.

Once more he reaches down to his side, and this time,
in some way, he comes away with the arrow. He sits
for a moment with the bloody shaft in his hands, like
a religious object, just looking at it, and it is
bloody indeed.

How he looks over the rock again onto the sandy shelf.
THE MAN has gone.

ED gets to his feet, painfully, protecting his hurt
side. He picks up the bloody knife, and, with a great
deal of awkwardness and effort, cuts a sleeve off his
outfit and a long strip from one leg, and puts the
sleeve over the wound as a bandage and binds it with
the strip of nylon from the leg. He is a weird-looking
figure when this has been done. He hugs his side with
a crooked arm and leans into the wound as he walks.

He moves out onto the sandy shelf. He goes to the
place where THE MAN was, and stands looking down,
swaying and thinking.

ED gets dOwn on one knee, winoing with pain, and runs
his hand-over‘the rocks and sand. He picks up a
handful of sand with blood in it and rifles through it
like a placer-miner examining gold-dust.

Still on his knees he follows the blood trail of the
hurt MAN. He looks for it and finds it: on stones,
on pine needles, on blades of grass.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

o“

ED follows the blood, rock by rock: following the blood
spoor like a dog would.

He moves on, stone by stone, leaf by leaf, irregularly
stopping sometimes to search, then finding the blood again
and going on.

His head low down, he is startled to suddenly come upon the
rifle.

It is long and flat and old. Oddly, it is a repeating rifle
rather than a shuck-action. ED touches it.

He goes on, past the gun, and into a canopy of leaves.

Here, it is harder to find the blood. He looks at bushes,
at the leaves on bushes individually, at pinestraw, at small
pebbles. Back and forth. Finally he finds one drop, and
this.one drop draws him further on, deeper in.

EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS DAY

ED gets to his feet with a weird corckscrew movement. He is
in a clearing.

He stands there swaying, not knowing what to do, looking
about.

ED starts around the perimeter of the clearing. He is still
staggering, but learning to hold himself together a little
better, learning to cope with what he has to cope with,

The sun is slanting and shuddering on the ground around him,
and the wind is sighing in,the branches Overhead, He goes
along through this modified cathedral atmosphere, looking
for more blood, holding his side together, holding his own
blood in.

He stops, peering.

There iS'a dead tree about twenty yards away, and something
lying at the foot of it. ED moves to this, and then looks
down onto the BODY OF A MAN. It has held of one root of the
tree.

ED turns him over with a foot. He has a hand on his knife,
He pulls the knife slowly and purposefully out of the case,
and bends down. He looks at the CORPSE'S face.

A scream comes from him: a terrible scream of frustration and
horror.

ED
Oh no: Oh _I‘Q! _
(CONTINUED)

 

 

73.

55 (Cont. )

56.

The MAN'S mouth if full of yellow teeth.

Shaken and fascinated, ED gets down on one knee with the
knife in his hand. .Shuddering, he holds the MAN's head and
pries at his upper gum with the knife, and an upper plate
begins to slide from it. As soon as this is established, ED
turns the knife and drives the false teeth back into the
mouth.

ED takes the knife into his hand again. A low growl comes
from him. This is a moment balanced between infinite
possibilities: ED could do anything at this point. He has
the face of a primitive man. His features are transformed
by extreme effort and lack of sleep. He looks savage.

ED's breath again, harsh and loud. Into the breath comes
some kind of crazy melody, maybe something of the Beatles:
something identifiable, There is also some suggestion of
an advertising jingle: one of these inescapable tunes from
our daily life.

ED
King Size Coke has more for you...
King Size Coke has more for you...

ED's eyes are truly maniacal as he continues to sing and hum
crazily.

Shaken by his own incipient violence, ED fumbles the knife
back into the case. He takes hold of THE MAN and tries to
get him up on his shoulders in the old fireman's carry from
Boy Scout days. Finally he gets up with THE MAN: and Starts
back- through the cathedral woods, with the wind blowing
lightly through the trees and the sunSpots dancing on the
ground, The weather is pleasant and bright: early morning
spring.

ED staggers through the bushes with THE MAN on his back. He

is barely making it, but he is making it. They tear through ;
small boughs of rhododendrons. Finally they break th_ough . i
the last screen of the woods and move slowly back into the
clearing. Ed puts the MAN down at almOSt. the exact spot
where he shot him, collapsing with him. They both lie per-
fectly still side by side, indistinguishable, one creature.

EXT. CLIFF TOP , DAY

ED takes the rifle by the barrel, swinging it twice around
his head like a hammer-thrower,'and slings it out over the
river. It falls away, spinning. It hits the water.

Now ED throws the death-arrow and the other one into the
river like spears. He piCkS'up the broken bow, and he turns
it over in his hands. There is the greatest affection in his

face: This is the thing that saved all their lives, but
mainly his own life.

Then the spell breaks, and ED—steps deliberately to the
cliff tap and pitches the bow over the side. It falls away.

ED steps back beside the dead MAN and takes stock. He
begins to uncoil the rope, and it is evident that he has
quite a lot of it.

ED ties the rope undbr the arms of the dead HAN and walks
over and ties the other end to a tree growing at almost the
very edge of the cliff.

He goes back to THE BODY and hauls it to the edge of the
cliff, takes up the slack in the rope with his hands, and
kicks and shoves the body over the cliff with his feet.

ED braces back and strains to let THE BODY down, arm over
arm. _

It goes hard. ED sweats and strains, tries to take a turn
of rope around his body, finds he can't do it, lets the
BODY down foot by foot. He backs up and braces himself
against the tree, working harder than he’s ever worked in
his life.

The coil of rope wears slowly... very slowly away at ED's
feet.

Finally, at long last, all the rope is gone, and ED steps
away from the tree, trying to get his hands unclenched. He
wrings his hands up and down like someone who's touched a
hot stove,'trying to get the circulation back into them.

He goes to the edge and looks down, then gets down on his
knees at the cliffside and takes hold of the rope with both
hands.

He gets his feet over the edge and starts down on the rope,
letting himself down hand over hand, straining and hurting,
but going down well enough. He scrambles against the cliff-
face with his feet, finding footholds.

BOBBY, hearing something, wades out into the river to look

up at ED and THE CORPSE swinging on the rope. It is

evident that ED is almost completely exhausted. He goes down
toward where the CORPSE dangles below; He is almost there.

ED stops to rest on a little ledge. THE CORPSE is about ten
or fifteen feet under him, swinging moodily in the breeze
from the river, spinning idly, knocking against the cliff
face. -

(:3 ED sits, holding the rope. He is still about fifty feet up
3 from the river,and he is evidently figuringwhat to do. From
"”1 where he site he can see even LEWIS lying in the bottom of
the canoe. LEWIS's position is terribly twisted looking and
unnatural. He has his hand over his face. BOBBY stands

watching.

0n the ledge, ED looks at his free hand, flexing the fingers.
He slides off the ledge and starts down again.

ED is almost on top of THE CORPSE. He hangs there for a
moment, looking down, trying to figure what to do.

Suddenly it is as though the film had broken. but what has
really happened is that the rope has broken. There is an
instant of pure blackness, then the sky and the river and-the
gorge turn haphazardly and idly about each other, There is

a muffled yell, The yell is suddenly cut off, and ED is in
another world° '

It is green and quiet, underwater, ED finds himself inter—
twined with the CORPSE whose limbs move under the water with
uncanny animation. It is as though the man were trying to
embrace ED or drown him. He fights free. Cooked to one side
of the pervading green is a suffused yellow area, and

(T) gradually ED approaches this. As he gets closer to it, he
_“xg sees that it is something like a submerged sun, wavering and
if? expanding. .In fact, it is the sun, and it explodes in his

face as ED's head comes clear of the water.

57. EXT. ssLow THE RAPIDS DAY

ED struggles feebly in the water, trying to discover if he‘s
been hurt even more, trying to move his arms and legs and
discovering that he can do it. He begins, with infinite
weariness and effort, to swim to the canoe.

ED reaches the battered side of the canoe, standing up in
the shallow water among the rocks, and looking over the
gunwale into the bottom of the canoe.

BOBBY has reached out to help him in.

LEWIS is lying there, either dead or barely alive. The floor
of the canoe is awash-with filthy water, much of it contain-
ing stuff that LEWIS has vomited up. This is floating and
softly sloshing around LEWIS's form. .

BOBBY

BOBBY '
And you killed him? You killed him?

Again ED says nothing but goes over to look at LEWIS. There
is no sign of life. He bends down to listen for his

breathing.

BOBBY
Lewis has been having a bad time.
Once I thought he'd died; He's
awful bad hurt.

He gets up and they walk over to where the DEAD MAN lies on
the rocks, face down, with the rope piled on and off him.

BOBBY
(looking up with
incredulity)
IS thiSoo-oo?

ED
(not absolutely sure,
but fairly sure)
Yes. I think so. It‘s got to be.
He had a gun.

BOBBY
But it might have been just.a guy
out.... .

ED

He was in the right place at the
right time. No; it's got to be him.

BOBBY suddenly catches a glimpse of ED's injury.

ED shakes his head.

is hard to tell which is dead, and which is not, for they
both might be. THE CORPSE has a number of rocks tied to him
with cut up lengths of ED's rope.

They are moving from the bank out to the middle of the large
pool under the rapids.

They ship their paddles and heave out the rocks. The
procedure is grotesque and terrifying, and-also in a
greusome way funny, for THE CORPSE does not seem to want to
leave the canoe. It hangs spreadeagled on the gunwale. In
a wild, desperate and abandoned movement, ED picks up the
last and biggest rock, the one tied around the BODY's neck,
and with great effort, heaves it out. THE CORPSE is whisked
with breathtaking quickness away and into the river. The
canoe rocks widly.

ED and BOBBY now begin to paddle, very slowly, in a
grotesque parody of canoeing.

The canoe moves away, down river. Neither look back.

The canoes turns out of the gorge and into the eye of the
sun and it seems to float upon pure liquid gold, pure light;
and in the middle of this, the TWO exhausted MEN.

The sun burns higher. Dreamlike, the trees drift past them.
LEWIS lies with.an arm over his face. The canoe glides on
through the black water.

EXT. DREW'S ROCK DAY

They come around another turn, and there is a momentary but
definite impression of a man, a body, facing the canoe from
some of the river-rocks downstream.

BOBBY
(turning, in unbelief
and horror)

‘Ed:
ED
(quietly)
Is it Drew?
BOBBY
(sobbing)
Yes. Yes.
ED

Let's go to him.
(CONTINUED)

7B.

59 (Cont.) . .
DREW is sitting in a grotesque position in the rocks, as
though in a kind of natural chair, the water flowing over
him, prepping his head back, a thin continuous spray of it
going into his open mouth. He~has his eyes wide open,
gazing upstream as if forever.

The canoe rides just past THE BODY and stops.

 

With infinite weariness, ED gets out of the canoe onto the
rocks and the shallows around them., He walks the length of
the canoe, and comes to BOBBY, who is stting, holding his
half-paddle,'asleep.

He jabs at BOBBY who wakes up and gets slowly out of the
canoe.

DREW sits there, uncaring, a stupid, water-caused, streaming
grin on his face° He even looks happy, in a kind of weird,
eternal way.

ED tries to pull the BODY out of the rocks, and at first
can't do it. Then he gets THE BODY by the straps of its
life-jacket and hauls it forward. The effort makes ED trip,
he flounders and falls into the river, and THE CORPSE, freed,
begins to float serenely away.

ED flounders after THE CORPSE, gets it over to one of the
rocks and beaches it.

He turns THE CORPSE over, looking at it intently.

ED
(beckoning to Bobby
without looking in his
direction)
Bobby, come here, There's something
we've got to decide about.

 

BOBBY reaches ED, and-ED points down at something concerning

THE CORPSE.
They hang on the rock, panting and gasping.
ED ,
Is this a gunshot wound?
BOBBY

Ed, you know I wouldn't know. But
it sure doesn't look like it to me.

ED
(evidently touching some-
thing on the corpse)
What about this place, though?

BOBBY.
How can we know?
ED .
Lewis would know. Let's give him
a look.

They drag DREW's body to the gunwale of the canoe. They
put DREW's head up over the gunwale so that LEWIS can have
a close look at the back and side of it.

ED sinks down until his head is exactly on the same level
as DREW's.

ED
(softly)
Lewis.

 

LEWIS is either dead or sleeping or passed out.

ED
(softly but urgently)
Lewis, give us just a second. It's
important. It's very important.

LEWIS raises his head and opens his eyes.

ED holds DREW's head in a gentle grasp, turning it slightly
and with the other hand pointing to the place he wants
LEWIS to look at. i

ED.
Lewis, was he shot? Did a bullet ‘
make this?

A flicker of the .old enthusiasm crosses LEWIS's eyes and
face. He looks maniacal and wise. He knows something the
others don't. Or does he?

ED

(more urgently)
Well, was he shot? Was he, Lewis?

eyes, and stares into them. They stare at each other.

Slowly and almost imperceptibly LEWIS nods his head.

Grazed.

LEWIS sinks back into the bottom of the canoe.

BOBBY

But we can't have anybody examining

Are we going to get out of this?
I don t see how we can. I really
don't.

ED

We're almost out of it now.

BOBBY

BOBBY

ED
That's right: if he was.

BOBBY
(looking down into
the river)
There's no end to it.
(shaking his head)
No end.

ED bends and fumbles in his leg pocket for the extra
bowstring he's brought along, and brings it out. It
contains a built-in peep sight such as the one on the
string he used to kill the man with, except this sight
is blue rather than orange.

__ ED ties the string around a big rock and the other end
(:3 around DREW's belt. de puts the rock in the canoe, and
BOBBY gets bask in. ED begins to float DREH's body
downriver in its kapok life jacket, going along beside
the body in his own life jacket, swimming slowly. ‘

 

DREW floats face—up, his hands spread wide in the water.
ED is very close to him, and he looks at one of DREW's
hands.

It has a college class ring on it, and guitar calluses
on the tips of the fingers, now puckered with the water.
ED feels these with is own hand.

ED seems to cry or choke on the river water.

ED
You were the best of us, Drew.

ED undoes DREW‘s life jacket, and throws it into the canoe.
He nods to BOBBY. ‘

THE BODY is snatched under.

EXT. THE RIVER HILLY COUNTRY DAY

They are out of the gorge, back to the gentle wooded slopes.
ED is paddling at long intervals, Just keeping the canoe on

,a course. BOBBY is slumped in his seat, completely out of

it. LEWIS is utterly still.

They come around another turn, and the river begins to speed
up, but is not particularly dangerous-looking. And yet the
sound goes up and up, becoming something close to a roar.

It draws them out of their torpor. They sit up listening.

ED .
(Afraid to believe
what he's hearing)
Bobby, I think I hear rapids. I know
I do.

EXT. FINAL RAPIDS DAY

The canoe begins to move faster, then faster and faster.
What is out of sight around the next turn is making the sound
They start to paddle finding energy in the new danger.

ED

They go into the turn, and the water is getting vicious.
ED and BOBBY work with the stream, doing what they can.

The sound is now tremendous. Spray is flying around the
canoe.

universe itself.

BOBBY simply flings his half-paddle away and gets ready to
die, his hands over his face.

BOBBY drops back off his seat, holding onto the gunwales
with both hands, riding right into the teeth of the white
water.

The canoe careers through a mist of spray which foams up
around it seeming to carry it into another element altogether.
Down, down they go as though they will slip off the side of
the world.

ED fights to keep the craft straight, the paddle almost torn
from his hand by the unbridled violence of the water.

LEWIS screams soundlessly as the canoe bucks and scrapes
over rocks.

ED has a look of profound exultetion on his face, of wonder-
ful, dreadful enjoyment.

(shouts) 4
Hold on, boys: We're going home:

It becomes evident that this whole set of rapids culminates
in a fall-off of about six feet. In other words, if they
can get through this, they're out of danger, at least from
this particular set of rapids.

They ride up to the fall—off, looking at it with horrified
fascination. They go up, and the canoe is flying ~ it has
leapt out of the river.

It comes down with terrific impact. It almost capsizes,
but doesn't. And there it is.

EXT. FLAT COUNTRY DAY

The-canoe idles into the calm water past the falls. It is
sloshing with water, and LEWIS is practically submerged.

BOBBY, still fallen back from his seat, tries to turn and
say something, but he doesn't. ED pants-end heaves for his
breath. 'He looks down at his side and clenches it with his
arm.

Finally, ED, getting things together in his head, speaks.

- ED
Right here is where it all happened.

BOBBY turns around - as much as he can - and stares as

though a savage or a madman had spoken. He has no notion
of what ED means.

Ed bends forward towards LEWIS.

ED

LEWIS makes no movement, but lies as still as ever. His
face is badly sunburned, his lips cracked. It is something
of a shock when he speaks.

LEHS

I hear you. You've got it figured.
We can get out of this. You're
doing it exactly right; better than
I could do.

ED is distrubed by LEWIS's stillness. It is as though he
has passed across some threshold to the calm edge of death.

ED

Can you hold out a little longer?
LEWIS

Sure.
ED

There can't be too far to go now.

BOBBY
Ed: Look here:

ED looks up from LEWIS at the river bank where BOBBY is
pointing. It is a cow: a plain black and white Friesian
cow. Peacefully it crops the grass at the river’s edge.

There is that special bond between them that comes from
having been through hell together.

The land is domesticated, pastoral, pleasant.

EXT. BRIDGE AT AINTRY DAY

ED and BOBBY are beaching the canoe on a_bank of shingle
close to a concrete bridge that carries a road over the
river. BOBBY sinks down next to the canoe, resting a hand
on it, 'minding it.‘

ED
I'm going to get help, Lewis. You'll
be out of there in no time.

ED turns and painfully limps up the slope to the road.

EXT. ROAD AND BRIDGE DAY

Reaching the road, ED looks up and down it. The road is
straight and empty and shimmering with heat. Through the
haze, some two hundred yards away, is a gas station. He
starts towards it. He is totally exhausted. He fixes his
eyes on the gas station, concentrating absolutely on the
problem of dragging his body to it.

An open truck goes past piled high with the furniture and
belongings of a poor family. TWO CHILDREN sit on a sofa at
the back and watch this curious, ragged man, holding his'
side, walking so slowly.

EXT. THE GAS STATION ' DAY

A shirtless—looking COUNTRY BOY sits in a kitchen chair
outside the station, cropped against the wall. He watches
ED coming with widening eyes, trying to calculate whether
this man is drunk or sick or mad or what.

Sitting there at the side of the garage are the two cars,
DREW's and LEWIS's.

ED looks at them in astonishment. He shakes his head and
blinks, as though trying to shake off an hallucination.

He stumbles up to them and slaps LEwlS's car, proving its
reality. Then he leans against it and laughs softly.

THE BOY gets up and calls over to him.

BOY
You came for the cars, mister?

ED

No.... Yes ... Not exacly.

THE BOY stands there hopelessly confused.

ED sits in a chair next to the phone among the pocket combs
for sale and cheap dark glasses. His head is slumped back
asleep, past caring. THE BOY watches him silently, not
moving.

EXT. BRIDGE AT AINTRY . DAY

The AMBULANCE DRIVER and HIS ASSISTANT gently lift LEWIS

out of the canoe. LEWIS groans or cries every time he is
moved. They take him over to the ambulance, BOBBY following
them making a token effort to help. ED leans heavily
against the ambulance.

With LEWIS inside the DRIVER helps ED in too. At this point
a Highway Patrol car drives up and stops, its antenna
swishing. TWO OFFICERS get out, one of them a mean-looking
blonde boy.

BLONDE-OFFICER

ED catches BOBBY's eye through the Open rear door of the
ambulance. They exchange a look which says "This is it" and
"here goes." BOBBY meets THE OFFICER as he gets out of

the car.

pulls away as BOBBY leads the OFFICER over to inspect the
canoe. '

INT. HOSPITAL DAY

ED is lying on the examining table of the emergency room.

.His flying suit is in a heap on the floor. He wears only

his shorts, his filthy tennis shoes and his improvised
bandage.

The tight lines in ED’s face are beginning to relax. He has
an expression of perfect contentment. He is luxuriating in
the safety and security of organised civilisation as
represented by the hospital. He looks around at the
ordinary medical paraphernalia.

ED ,
It's.beautiful. Beautiful.

A DOCTOR has been scrubbing his hands in a basin. He turns
now, wiping them dry.

DOCTOR

ED \
Oh, chromium, paper tissues, a tap

Using something from a bottle, THE DOCTOR gets off ED's
bandage. -

THE DRIVER is helping ED out of the front seat._ He is back
in the ragged flying suit. Through a tear in the side, the
brilliant white of fresh bandages shows.

DRIVER
Take it easy, now.

ED
I will. I will.

A brisk, aproned WOMAN of 60 opens the screen door on the
sagging porch before he gets up the steps.

WOMAN
Come on in. You're expected.

INT. BIDDIFORD'S EVENING

BOBBY is hovering behind the WOMAN chewing a mouthful of
food. Beyond him is a dining room table round which sit
TWELVE OR FOURTEEN PEOPLE.

They are all looking though at ED who stands in the lobby
looking rather limp.

WOMAN _
VYou better set just how you are.
I'll bet you can use a hot meal.

She-leads him in and seats him. BOBBY goes back to his
place. The OTHER GUESTS have still not resumed eating or i
talking. They look at him with some awe. _ 1

THE WOMAN piles up his plate and he puts a morsel to his I
mouth. It is like a sign. There is a rush of talk and i
clatter and laughter.

They all eat again and everybody wants to pass ED something,
to do something for him. It is too much for him. He begins
to cry - for Drew, for his own pain, but mostly in gratitude
for being welcomed back to the human race. '

ED catches BOBBY's eye across the table and they exchange
a look which is like a thanksgiving.

Then ED wipes his eyes on his sleeve and starts to eat in
earnest.

w) 71. INT. BEDROOM BIDDIFORD'S DAY

ED is lying in brilliant sunlight on a big country bed. He
has part of a sheet over him. He wakes up to a knock on
the door.

ED
Come in.

BOBBY comes through the door dressed in a set of new clothes-
jeans, a workshirt, brogans. He has another similar set
over his arm.

ED sits up,wincing, as BOBBY puts the outfit on the bed.

' BOBBY
Here. Hope they fit.

(lowers his

A guy's been here asking about the -
canoes.

ED
(quickening)
What guy? What about the canoes?

ED sits up.straight on the bed.

. BOBBY
A little old guy who's some kind
of local law man. He asked me
about the other canoe, where was
it, when did we lose it.

ED
What did you tell him?

BOBBY
What we agreed to tell him:
that we lost it in that last bad
place. But-listen Ed they must

have found part of it up river.
They must have.

ED
Christ, what do we do now?

BOBBY
Can we patch up our story?

ED

(with desperate

reasonableness)
I think so. We have to try.
How this? ’We spilled twice.
The first time we lostthe canoe
and Lewis broke his leg. And at
this last falls we tipped over
again and lost Drew.

BOBBY
(warming to
it)
Right. It's better because the ‘
doctors can probably tell when
Lewis' leg was really broken.

ED .

Good. Good. 3

they talk to him. ‘

ED
(also whispering
now)
Hell, you're right. Let's go

to him.

ED desperately pulls on the rest of his new clothes. They
are bath caught in a sudden uncontrollable panic. BOBBY
kneels down and ties ED‘s boot laces. It is a good
posture for a prayer.

BOBBY
Please God, let us be in time.

INT. TAXI DAY ‘

BOBBY and ED sit nervously on the edge of the seat, in
their new anonymous clothes, as the grimy cab hauls them
through Aintry. The DRIVER throws off the odd bit of
information of local interest, figuring them as tourists.
BOBBY, sitting right behind the DRIVER clenches his fists,
like a jockey urging on a horse and mines 'Come on.‘

TAXI DRIVER
That there's our town hall.

Stores are boarded up, the streets empty. The town is
depressing and derelict.

TAXI DRIVER

EXT. HOSPITAL DAY

They get out, ED thrusting money and thanks at THE DRIVER.
The patrol car is empty. They hurry into the hospital try-
ing not to break into a run.

INT. HOSPITAL ‘ DAY

They pad down the corridor, looking rather furtive. THE
DOCTOR who stitched up ED appears in front of them. His
solicitous smile is genuinely human as well as professional.

DOCTOR
Well now, how's the Hari—kiri man?

They are forced to stop.

ED
Just fine, Doc, thanks to you.
We're anxious to see how our
friend is getting along.

ED starts to shuffle past him, BOBBY at his heels“

DOCTOR
Are they treating you well,
=up at Biddiford's?

BOBBY
Terrific,_just terrific.

They are past him now, and turn into the ward.

INT. HOSPITAL WARD _ DAY

ONE PATROLMAN stands at the end of the ward, just inside

the door, talking closely and intimately with the WARD
SISTER. His fellow sits next to the bed in which LEWIS lies
his leg up on pulleys. The FIRST PATROLNAN jerks up from
THE SISTER as ED enters.

ED
Have you been talking to him?

OFFICER
No. Waiting for him to come round.

( CONTINUED.)

Before anyone can say anything ED walks down to the bed
He smiles at the OTHER PATROLMAN.

ED
(softly)
Lewis. Are you awake?

. LEWIS opens his eyes and looks at ED with just the

suggestion or a wink. He has obviously been shamming
sleep.

ED
How you feeling?

LEWIS
(in the cracked dry
voice of the recently
anethesised)
Never better.

ED cannot think how to disguise his purpose from the
PATROLMAN whilst revealing it to LEWIS. He manages

to communicate his anxiety to LEWIS who studies his

face closely. ED glances at the PATROLMAN then olenches
his mouth; trying to show LEWIS he cannot talk in front
of the police. Up the ward BOBBY is engaging THE OTHER
MAN, creating a noisy distraction.

IEWIS
(inspired)
What happened on that last
stretch of rapids, buddy?
I I can't remember a thing.

_ED
'It killed Drew, Lewis.
LEWIS
(sad and not
acting)
I Should have saved him instead
Ofoﬂl.
ED

(quickly cutting in)
....How could you, lying.in the
canoe with your leg broken?

LEWIS's eye flickers with the old gamesmanship, catching
on.

LEWIS
We were overloaded, I guess.

THE PATROLMAN has been listening closely. Now he senses
something going on.

PATROLMAN
Now, just a minute.

But too late. LEWIS looks up into ED's eyes, understanding
everything.

76. EXT. RIVER BANK BELOW FINAL RAPIDS DAY
A miscellany of trucks, jeeps, pick-ups and two patrol cars
are drawn up on the river bank. In the river a number of
MEN are dragging with grappling hooks and chains. There
- are quite a FEW SPECTATORS, all enjoying the excitement.

ED sits on the bank next to a PATROLMAN who is obviously

(:3 posted to watch him.
té5% Another patrol car arrives and BOBBY steps out of it. ED
" turns to watch and gets a momentary impression that BOBBY

is a prisoner.

He is surrounded by POLICEMEI and OTHERS. A PATROLMAN is
talking to him with some vehemence, or appears to be.

ONE MAN detaches himself from the GROUP around BOBBY. He
is a small, old, light-bodied man. He comes over to ED
with the same sideways kind of walk the two men had when
they came out of the trees.

DEPUTY QUEEN
"Say, buddy. Can I talk to you
for a moment?

ED
. Sure. Sit down.

QUEEN
You say you started out day before
yesterday?

In two canoes.

ED
Right.

QUEEN
And you lost one of 'em right
here?

ED

No, a long ways upstream. When
we came through here, we were all
in one canoe.

They sit watching the searchers: the men, some of them
waistdeep in the river, working with their grapples. One
of the MEN in the river calls to another, as though he has
found something. He shows an object.

QUEEN
(deliberately and slowly,
still looking at the river)
Your buddy says different.

' ED
(with exaggerated
surprise)
I'll be damned if he does! Go ask
him.

other one farther up. Back up in
a gorge. I can take you and show
you where it was.

The SHERIFF had been standing right behind them. listening
leaning on the patrol car.

ED
Can you tell me what this man of
yours is getting at? He seems to
think we throw one of our party in
the river, or something.

' QUEEN
Maybe you did.

a bitch. My sister called me yester-
day and told me her husband had been
out huntin' and hadn't come back.

BULLARD looks from one to the other - as though politely
waiting to see if they have finished.

 

SHERIFF
You're sure about this other canoe,
now?

ED

You better believe I'm sure.

arm)

He ain‘t sure. He‘s lyin'. He's

about killing?

Listen, my sister called up last night,
and she was just aacryin'. Benson
ain't come home yet. She knows he's
dead. She just knows it. And these
fellers was the only ones up in there,
when he was.

SHERIFF
Now, you don't know that, Arthel.
What you mean is, they was the only
city fellows.

ED shakes his head, in both real and feigned unbelief at
such goings-on.

SHERIFF
You'll haVe to sign a statement tonight.
You can go home in the morning. Just
leave me your addresses.

ED
Just let us know if you find anything.

SHERIFF
Don‘t worry. You'll be the fust..

EXT. THE GAS STATION DAY

ED-and BOBBY are paying off a taxi which has brought them
up from Aintry. They go over to the two cars, DREW‘S and
LEWIS's. The same BOY is working the pumps and he comes
across a

BOY
Got the keys here.

At that moment, SHERIFF BULLARD cruises slowly up and
stops. They are just getting into the cars, and they
are obliged to get out again, rather awkwardly.

amused and detached.

SHERIFF
The Griner brothers drove these
down from Cree, right?

BOBBY
Right.

SHERIFF

BOBBY and ED glance at each other.

SHERIFF

Don't ever do anything like this
again. Don‘t come back up here.

ED

You don't have to worry about that.

You act like you're telling a hired
gun to get out of town. But we’re

The SHERIFF smiles lazily, dangerously, a cat pawing two
caught mice. ‘ .

SHERIFF

peaceful. So long. Have a good
trip.

 

ED
So long. And I hope Deputy Queen
finds his brother-inalaw.

SHERIFF

The SHERIFF's smile broadens just a little, but is still

,enigmatic, dangerous. He turns to his car. ED and BOBBY
“exchange a quick smile of relief. BOBBY pantomimes a

'yippee' gesture to the SHERIFF'S back. ED starts the car
and BOBBY swings into the other. They pull out on to the
road. BOBBY accelerates fiercely and passes ED, testing
his horn. They head towards the bridge and the river. It
is starting to rain°

INT. DREW'S CAR ' ‘ DAY

As BOBBY reaches the bridge he sounds his horn again and
keeps sounding it until he reaches the other side. Then it
stops and he is gone. ED slows down watching BOBBY go then
turns off down the ramp to the river bank.

EXT._ RIVER AT AINTHY BRIDGE . DAY

The light rain is mottling the river. He gets out of the
car and looks at the canoe which has been pulled well up
on the bank and turned over; Some muddy CHILDREN are
playing near it. -

ED runs his hands up and down the battered hull. It has
taken a terrific beating, there are gouged out dents in
the metal and only streaky remnants of paint.

ED's attention is attracted by some kind of activity
across the river. Behind the trees and bushes he makes
out a cemetery.

ED speaks to a little girl.

ED
What is it? A funeral?

LITTLE‘GIRL
(in very nasal,
country tones)
New. They're gonna move them
people ifore they finish the dam.
They're diggin them up.

ED takes a closer look. Now he can make out the stacked
coffins, and the MEN moving among them. Some kind of
mechanical digger is at work. The CHILDREN scamper off
downstream leaving ED a very solitary figure.

He looks down intently at the river, perhaps to fix it in
his mind or maybe he expects it to yield up some secret,
an answer. He looks back at the graveyard, frowning.' TWO
MEN hump a coffin on their shoulders. Suddenly, the ret=
ting side of the coffin falls away. They stop and try and
get a better hold, but the bottom sags and then collapses
and their whole burden disintegrates. They walk off un=
concernedly and pick up another coffin which the mechani=
cal-digger has gouged out of the ground.

ED watches_this scene with a puzzled look as though it
recalls a memory, or is the echo of a forgotten dream.
During this the first line of Duelling Banjoes is heard,
repeated over and over at first faint: , then more strong=
ly, the banjo answering the guitar.

BULLARD is standing with ED, LEWIS-and BOBBY. LEMIS has
crutches, his leg is amputated at the knee. At their
feet is a body, covered with a sheet. The SHERIFF is
speaking but the music drowns his words. He bends down
to lift the sheet. The THREE MEN strain forward to
watch in an agony of anticipation. He pulls up the
sheet with a violent motion.
