FADE IN:

EXT. FIELD — DAY

A football game is in progress. Six guys on each side,
all in their late teens and early twenties, wearing
khaki pants, work shirts, T—shirts. OVER, we hear the
voice of BRUCE DERRINGER. The first player we see is
VIRGE HOOGESTEGER.

BRUCE (V.O.)
Virge Hoogesteger., What kind of
name is that? Nicknamed 'The
Virgin.‘ Well, look at him. Poor
kid probably tries to get a girl
into bed and she wants to make him
brush his teeth and wash behind
his ears.

Then we see JACK BOCCI bulldozing down one of the
defense players.

BRUCE (V.O.)
Look at this goon. Jack Bocci
from Brooklyn. He's a magician.
Wants to be the next Houdini.
Well, he's escaped twenty—four
missions. Not bad for an amateur.

Next, EUGENE McVEY nervously making a play.

BRUCE (V.O.)
This is the religious one.
There's always a religious one.
Eugene McVey. Nineteen from
Cleveland. There's always one
from Cleveland. High strung,
nervous, always coming down with
something. How'd he get in this
bunch?

Next, we see RICHARD "RASCAL" MOORE showing off.

BRUCE (V.O.)
Rascal? That can't be his real
name. Here we go. Richard Moore,
but called the Rascal. Thinks
he's a real ladies man. Talks
dirty, the whole bit. Well, he'll
grow out of it. If he grows at all.

Then we see CLAY BUSBY, cooly running with the ball.
(CONTINUED)

1A

CONTINUED:

BRUCE (V.O.)
Clay Busby, a farmer's son from
Louisiana. Plays piano and sings.
Listen to this. Learned piano in
a New Orleans whorehouse. Better
keep that out of the papers.

Last, we see DANNY DALY. He has the ball and is going
for the touchdown as his team urges him on.

BRUCE (V.O.)
Oh boy, this kid couldn't be more
Irish if he tried. Even his name,
Danny Daly. He's the
intellectual. Writes poetry.
Likes to read. Hates sports.

Danny makes the touchdown. He shouts with exhilaration
and raises the ball in triumph. Just then, a huge olive
drab B—17 bomber appears out of nowhere and roars
directly overhead. The game is forgotten and everyone
starts running towards a short, boxy control tower. Now
we see that the football field is a grassy area on the
side of an air field with three intersecting runways.

Men are coming from all over the base, on foot and
bicycle, shouting out the number of planes: five, seven,
nine, twelve! Planes are appearing all over the sky.

EUGENE
Fifteen, sixteen!

JACK
How many went out?

DANNY
Twenty—one.

VIRGE

There's another!

We MOVE UP TO the control tower. The balcony is crowded
with men. THROUGH the window we see the CO (Commanding
Officer) on the phone.

INT. CONTROL TOWER — DAY

The CO is in his early thirties, impeccably—dressed.
He's in charge and handles his many responsibilities
efficiently —— no detail is too small. In the b.g. are
the adjutant and other personnel.

(CONTINUED)

lA

CONTINUED:

CO
Sir, they're still coming in.
How can I promise you 24 planes
tomorrow when they're not even
back?

The adjutant comes up to him with some papers, the CO
grabs them and motions the adjutant away. The CO is
shocked by what he hears. He speaks quietly.

CO
Where? But we hit that target a
month ago, sir. I thought...

The voice on the other end interrupts.

CO
I know we have to put the pressure
on, but I almost lost a quarter of

my...

The 8—2, a scholarly, bespectacled young man, comes in
from the balcony and waits to get the CO's attention.
Frustrated, exasperated, the CO listens to the voice on
the other end.

CO

Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I'll have my
ground crews work all night. I
was hoping to give them a little
break. We're having a dance
tonight in honor of the Group's
first anniversary...

(interrupted again)
Yes, I'll give you an update as
soon as I know more. Thank you,
sir. Goodbye.

He hangs up. He's shaken by the news he's received.

8—2
Sir, eighteen planes. Three still
out.

He nods, then hurries out the door to the balcony.
EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY — DAY

On the balcony, COLONEL BRUCE DERRINGER. Bruce is in
his mid—thirties, has all—American good looks and an
easy—going charm that he can turn on and off at will.
Bruce isn't watching the planes landing. He's looking
down at the lawn below. The CO comes out on the balcony
with the 8—2.

(CONTINUED)

2 CONTINUED:

BRUCE
So that's them.

CO
Those are the enlisted men.
You're meeting the officers
this afternoon.

BRUCE
They must be the ten luckiest
sons of bitches in the world.

CO
They're ordinary men, Bruce.

2A BRUCE'S POV

FROM the balcony DOWN TO the control tower lawn where
our six boys are just joining the crowd below.

BRUCE (0.8.)
Are you kidding? First, they
volunteer for this, then they
do 24 missions without a scratch.
They don't sound very ordinary

to me.
8—2
Two more, sir.
2B EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY — DAY

The CO looks out at arriving planes through his
binoculars.

BRUCE
You know, people at home are
getting pretty discouraged by our
losses. They're starting to think
daylight bombing is a mistake.

CO
It's the only way we're going to
win this war.

BRUCE
You're right, and we've got to
get that message across. That's
where I come in. The nation's
going to fall in love with those
boys. The first crew in the
Eighth Air Force to complete their
tour of duty.

(CONTINUED)

2B

CONTINUED:
CO
They haven't done it yet.
BRUCE
They will. You'll make sure of

it.
He leans on the balcony and looks down at the crew. We
MOVE DOWN TO them.
EXT. CONTROL TOWER LAWN

The six boys anxiously watch for the last plane.

DANNY
One more. It'd be great if
everyone came back today. With
the dance and everything.

CLAY
I give them four to one. Any
takers?

JACK
Me.

CLAY

Show me your money, Jack.

JACK
Gene, lend me some money.

EUGENE
What do I look like, Wells Fargo?

DANNY
There they are!

Danny points out at the horizon. The boys are relieved.
They push each other around a little, then turn and start
walking across the field towards the barracks. SOUND:
ENGINE SPUTTERING. (The following dialogue can be used
as the men walk away, if needed.)

VIRGE
I heard they brought in a swell
band for the dance tonight.

DANNY
Clay, maybe they'll let you sing
with them.

CLAY
No siree.

(CONTINUED)

680%-

5B

CONTINUED:
EUGENE
You sing to us in the plane all
the time.
CLAY
Yeah, but you guys ain't got no
taste.
OMITTED

EXT. BASE — DAY

The plane is coming in to land. It has two feathered
props and only the left front wheel is down. The wheel
touches the runway and the plane immediately tips to

the right. It pivots on its single wheel, scraping its
belly on the runway. The props on the right side bend
back, slowing the PLANE's spin. It starts to come to

a halt, but just as it looks like it's safe, it EXPLODES
in a sudden fiery blast.

EXT. CONTROL TOWER LAWN — DAY

The six boys recoil with shock and disbelief. Danny
watches as long as he can, then turns away —— he
can't stand it anymore.

EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY — DAY

Bruce is also looking at the burning plane with horror.
The CO is stony—faced. He shows no surprise and little
emotion —— he's seen it too often before.

CO
Come on, Bruce, you wanted to meet
the officers of the Southern
Belle.

BRUCE
Jesus, what happened? They were
almost home.

CO
Almost. The pilot came in on one
wheel. He should have belly
landed.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
BRUCE
Are they all... ?
CO
What do you think? Let's go,

Bruce.

He starts off the balcony. Bruce follows, but looks
over his shoulder once more at the burning plane.

EXT. BASE — DAY

The PLANE continues to burn. There's another small
EXPLOSION inside the plane and this BECOMES the white
flash of a photographer's camera.

OMITTED

INT. MESS HALL — DAY

DENNIS DEARBORN is sitting stiffly in a chair, the
bomb group symbol behind him on the mess wall. Dennis,
at twenty—six, is the oldest of the crew. He's a
serious young man —— you never catch him smiling or
relaxing. His photo has just been taken by a Life
Magazine photographer. Bruce is behind the camera,
interviewing Dennis.

BRUCE
You named the plane after your
girl back home, that's a great
angle. You don't sound like
you're from the South, Captain
Dearborn.

DENNIS
I met her when I was in Memphis
on business.

BRUCE
I bet she's a living doll, huh,
Dennis?
Dennis looks up at Bruce —— he doesn't like his tone at
all.
DENNIS

She's a very fine woman, sir.

(CONTINUED)

ll

CONTINUED:

Flash. Now LUKE SINCLAIR, the co—pilot, is in the chair.
Luke is twenty—five and about as handsome as they come.
He's relaxed, smiling. He loves the attention.

BRUCE
A lifeguard. That's a pretty
responsible job, Luke.

LUKE
Yeah, it's rough basking in the
sun all day, having girls swarm
all over you. That's why I
joined up. Had to get away from
all that.

Flash. Now VAL KOZLOWSKI the bombardier, is sitting in
the hotseat. Val has Latin good looks and a street
fighter's body. He's a pretty intense guy. He squirms,
pushes at his hair, tries to loosen his collar,
straighten his tie.

BRUCE
Val. What's that short for,
Valentine? I bet the women love
that. You're the bombardier and
I understand you've got four
years of medical school under
your belt.

VAL
Yeah. Well, something like that.

BRUCE
(interrupting)
Believe me, when your picture
comes out in Life Magazine, every
man, woman and child in America is
going to want you to be their
doctor.

Val brightens at this. Flash. Now PHIL LOWENTHAL is in
the chair. Phil's in his early twenties, with a lot of
hair and a lot of teeth. He slumps in the chair, moody
and gloomy. He'd like to be anywhere but here.

BRUCE
Phil, look at the camera. Sit up
straight. Smile.

PHIL

What's there to smile about, sir?
BRUCE

You guys have finished 24 missions.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

BRUCE (CONT'D)
One more and you get to go home.
That would sure make me smile.

PHIL
Well, you're not me, sir.
(to the
photographer)
Please just take the picture.

He looks up at the camera, a big cloud over his head.
Flash.

INT. MESS HALL — DAY (LATER)

Dennis, Luke, Phil and Val are sitting at a table as
Bruce addresses them.

BRUCE
You'll go back home in your own
plane and fly all over the States,
making speeches, getting people to
buy more war bonds, work longer
hours, turn out more planes. And
believe me, you'll be wined,
womened and songed from one end of
the U.S. to the other. It'll be
tough, but we all have to make

sacrifices.
He laughs.
LUKE
Sir, you mean we're going to be
famous?
BRUCE

Afraid so, Luke.

Luke whoops. He pounds on Val and Phil a little. Val
pushes him away. Phil is hunched over, miserable.

DENNIS
Colonel Derringer...

BRUCE
Bruce.

DENNIS

We'll follow your orders to the
best of our...

(CONTINUED)

IO.
12 CONTINUED:

BRUCE
(interrupting)
It's not an order, Dennis. We're
working together.

DENNIS
Yes, sir, but I don't want the
other men finding out about this
yet.

LUKE
Their pictures in Life? Wine,
women and song? You've got to
tell them! They'll go nuts!

DENNIS
I don't want them going nuts.
Right now I want them thinking
about their jobs and that's all.

LUKE
Come on, we could do our jobs in
our sleep! Why can't they know?

DENNIS
Because I said so.

LUKE
My father used to say that.

Dennis and Luke glare at each other.

BRUCE
Dennis, you're the boss. Tell
your crew when you think it's
right. Gentlemen, thank you for
your time.

Dennis, Luke, Phil and Val start getting up from the
table.

15 INT. BARRACKS — NIGHT

A big tin—roofed Nissen hut, six beds on each side and a
HISSING potbellied STOVE in the center. Two crews bunk
in here, our enlisted men and another crew. In the b.g.,
a NEWS REPORT is heard on the RADIO, then MUSIC begins.
There's lots of activity as men get ready for the dance.
Jack is involved in a poker game at one end of the room.
At the other end, Clay is wrenching off the padlock on a
locker at the foot of a stripped bunk.

Danny is loading film

anything embarrassing,

The lock comes off, Clay opens the locker and starts
sorting through the contents. Eugene is putting on his
socks. He sniffs them and gags.

EUGENE

Anyone got any clean socks?

Hershey bar.

Me, me!

Clay tosses it to him.

CLAY

VIRGE

Virge rips it open and starts

eating it. Around Virge's bunk are drawings of a restau—
rant. As he munches the candy bar, he studies them.

VIRGE

Anyway, Danny, then I'm going to
open a whole bunch of restaurants,
exactly like the first one. So
you can go to Detroit and get the
exact same hamburger you got in

Baltimore.

DANNY

Virge, nobody wants the same old
food everywhere they go.

VIRGE

Sure they do. It's comforting.

CLAY

Love letters.

EUGENE

Wife or girl friend?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

Clay opens one and reads it.

RASCAL
Read 'em out loud! Get me in the
mood for tonight.

CLAY
Girl friend.

He tosses the letters to Virge, who puts them in the
stove.

EUGENE
Does Becker have any clean socks
in there?

Eugene goes over to the locker, searches for socks. Clay
puts the next few items in a pile on the bed.

CLAY
Air medal, photos, pocket knife.
Dirty book!

DANNY

I'll take it.

Clay tosses the paperback to Danny: God's Little Acre,
with a lurid cover. Danny flips through it. In the
middle is stuck: a four—leaf clover wrapped in
cellophane.

DANNY
Look. Becker forgot his good luck
charm.

VIRGE
Poor slob.

EUGENE

He should of worn it around his
neck. Then you never lose it.

He kisses his St. Anthony medal.

CLAY
Rubbers.

RASCAL
Dibs!

Clay tosses them to him. Then puts some other things on
the bed in the widow's pile: money, a compass, a diary.

(CONTINUED)

RASCAL
We know Virge the Virgin won't
need them. Virge, you gotta
promise if you ever lose your
cherry, you'll tell me about it.

VIRGE
I'll send it to you. C.O.D.

Eugene starts searching his bunk area. Jack comes run—
ning up and takes some money from the pile on Becker's

bunk.

JACK
Becker owed me ten.

DANNY
Jack, don't take his money!

JACK
He owed it to me! Hey, what do
you guys know about Germany?

EUGENE
Pretty women.

DANNY
Good beer.

VIRGE

The hamburger's named after a town
there.

JACK
Well, a little bird told me that's
where they're sending us tomorrow.

The men react with disbelief and shock.

EUGENE
You sure?

RASCAL
We ain't going to Krautville. Our
plane's broke.

VIRGE
No, it's fixed.

RASCAL
Christ, let's go break it!

VIRGE
Anybody want the rest of this
stuff?

Virge, Danny, Rascal, Jack and Eugene start towards the
bunk.

SHOT FROM ABOVE

Clay dispenses the rest of Becker's possessions with the
other men standing around the bunk.

CLAY
Deck of cards. Razor blades.
Lucky Strikes. Shoelaces. Pack
of Doublemint...

Rascal takes the cards, Jack the razor blades, Danny the
cigarettes, Eugene the shoelaces, Virge the gum. We
start to hear BIG BAND MUSIC and we're in ——

INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR — NIGHT

It has been turned into a dance hall for the night:
streamers, a mirror ball, a bar and a big band. The
dance is in full swing. Jack is dancing with a shy
skinny girl and Eugene is dancing with a boisterous big
girl. It looks like they're with the wrong partners.
Eugene swings under the big girl's arm, kicks Jack in
the butt when his back is turned, then quickly swings
back into the big girl's arms. Jack looks around, but
has no idea where the kick came from.

ON DANNY
He snaps a picture of them.

CUT TO:
RASCAL

talking to a pretty English girl, FAITH. He's really
milking this for all the sympathy he can get.

RASCAL
Now they're saying maybe we're
going to Germany tomorrow... my

short, young life could just be
snuffed out in an instant.

He chokes up. Faith looks away.

FAITH'S POV — VIRGE

standing across the room, alone, shy and very cute.
CUT TO:

RASCAL

is so wrapped up in his pitch he doesn't realize Faith's
attention has wandered.

RASCAL

Oh, Faith, when I think I might
never see the stars again or hear
good music or talk to a beautiful
girl like you...

(wipes away a tear)
Sorry. You need a drink. I'll be
right back.

He takes her glass and hurries over to the bar. It's
packed. Val is there, checking out the girls on the
dance floor.

RASCAL
She's crazy about me. She's going
to jump on me any second.

He burrows his way into the crowd. Phil comes up with a
brimming glass of whiskey. He's already a little drunk.

VAL
Phil, come on, you've had enough.

PHIL
How come they brought Life Magazine
over and everything? Are they
trying to jinx us?

VAL
Just forget it. Let's find us a
couple girls.

Val looks out at the dance floor. Phil comes up to him,
close.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

PHIL

Val, tell me the truth. The truth.
Are you scared?

VAL
I'm Val. Come on.

He takes Phil's glass from him, sets it down on a nearby
table and pulls Phil toward the dance floor.

CUT TO:
FAITH

is with Virge. He's excitedly talking about his
restaurant.

VIRGE
You've never had a hamburger?
That's unbelievable. You don't
know what you're missing.

FAITH
They sound wonderful. It's been
so long since I've had any meat.

Virge takes Faith's hand and demonstrates his technique.
He has no idea he's turning her on.

VIRGE
See, I work the meat very slowly,
very tenderly. That's the secret.
Rub in a little Worcestershire, a
little garlic, a little thyme.
Then ease it into a patty...
gentle, gentle, so I don't bruise
the meat.

FAITH
Virge, you're making me so hungry!

CUT TO:
RASCAL

comes out of the mob at the bar with Faith's drink. He
looks around to where Faith was waiting, but she's not
there. She's nowhere to be seen.

BRUCE AND LUKE

sitting at a table with a couple of girls. They've
obviously become the best of buddies.

BRUCE
Ever done any public speaking,
Luke?

LUKE

A little acting. Amateur stuff.

BRUCE
I bet you were good. We're going
to have to excite people on this
bond tour. Inspire them. Dennis
is a fine man, but he doesn't
have your enthusiasm.

LUKE
I'm a qualified pilot, same as
him. They just didn't have a
plane for me. So, he's the big
shot pilot and I'm sitting in
the dummy seat.

BRUCE
You're no dummy, Luke. We both
know that.

Bruce puts a hand on Luke's shoulder.
CUT TO:
DENNIS

standing with the ROOKIE LIEUTENANT, a fresh—faced,

very naive young man. Dennis is trying to describe

the excitement and responsibility of being a pilot,

but he's inarticulate. The Rookie Lieutenant has no
idea what he's talking about.

DENNIS
Just wait till you go up for the
first time. You've got four
thousand pounds of bombs in your
belly, nine other men are depending
on you to make the right decision.
It's...

You're really alive up there,

You'll see what I mean.

ROOKIE LIEUTENANT
Well, uh, thanks a lot, Captain.
I've got to get a refill.

The Rookie Lieutenant hurries off, anxious to get away
from Dennis. Dennis looks across the room.

DENNIS'S POV

Bruce and Luke at the table with with the girls, having
a great time, laughing, chatting.

ON DENNIS

Feeling alienated, alone, he turns and walks out the
door.

EXT. BASE — NIGHT

It's dark, foggy. Dennis walks across the field toward
another hangar, a beer in his hand. The BAND can be
heard in the DISTANCE.

INT. SECOND HANGAR — NIGHT

It is brightly, starkly lit with floodlights. There are
planes and parts of planes crowded in here with ground
crews crawling over them. It is an epic sight, showing
the huge scale of the air war and the number of men
required to sustain it. In the f.g. is a plane, "Is You
Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?" The pilot's window is
shattered, a front tire is flat, a chunk has been taken
out of the tail, the ball turret is broken in half and
what remains is covered in dried blood. A mechanic is
hosing it out. LES ENRIGHT, a stocky man in his mid—
thirties, wearing grease—stained coveralls, is helping
carry a new ball turret over to the plane. Dennis goes
over to him.

DENNIS
Les, what are you doing here?
You're my ground crew chief.
You're supposed to be working on
my plane.

LES
Sir, I'm just helping out...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
DENNIS

You should be giving the
supercharger on Number One your...

LES
Supercharger's fixed.

DENNIS
Okay, but how about the cowl flaps
on...

LES

Number three's fixed. It's all
fixed. You don't have to tell me
my job, Captain. Watch your feet.

A dark red pool is gathering right at Dennis feet.
Dennis looks down, sees it and steps away.

LES
The Belle's in mint condition. If
you don't believe me, go look at
her. She's out on the apron, Sir.

Les turns back to work. A moment. Dennis knows he
jumped on Les a little too fast, but he also doesn't
want to apologize. He turns and goes out the door.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE — NIGHT

We see only the vague outline of the Belle through the
fog as Dennis approaches. He stops in front of the nose
and speaks to the plane.

DENNIS
Well, I'm going to miss you, girl.
We've been together a long time
and you've never let me down. I
can't say that about many people.
You know how to take care of your
man and that's just about the best
thing a fellow can say about a
girl, I guess. Maybe we'll be
going back to the States together,
but it won't be the same, will it?
It won't have the same...

He searches for the word, can't find it, then starts to
take a drink. But he decides he's had enough and pours
the rest of the beer on the ground. He turns and walks
back across the field to the dance. Then a head pops up
and looks out through the nose of the plane: Virge.

FAITH (O.S.)
I wish you'd talk to me like that,
Virge.

20.
18 INT. NOSE — NIGHT

Looking forward, we see Virge and Faith in silhouette.
They've put something down on the floor of the plane as
a makeshift bed, perhaps some parachutes.

VIRGE
You know what the captain would do
if he caught us in here? He'd
murder me. Come on, Faith, let's
get this over with and get back
to the dance.

They try to get it going again.

FAITH
Wait, there's something... Hold
on. There! Sorry.

Faith pulls something out from under her. Virge grabs
it.

VIRGE
My wrench! I've been looking for
that all over! Where'd you find
it?

FAITH
Under my bum.

VIRGE
Oh, thanks. Boy, I thought
someone stole it.

FAITH
Virge, forget the bloody wrench.

She grabs him and kisses him. A CLUNK as he drops the
WRENCH and kisses her back.

FAITH
You've never done this before,
have you?

VIRGE

Why, am I doing something wrong?
FAITH

No. You're doing everything just

right.
He embraces her and kisses her.
18A EXT. HANGAR — NIGHT
Virge and Faith are near the hangar door. He kisses her.

(CONTINUED)

21.
18A CONTINUED:

FAITH
That was...

VIRGE
Yeah, it really was.

Awkward pause.

FAITH

I wouldn't want this to get around.
VIRGE

Around?
FAITH

I know what you Yanks are like,
always bragging about your women.

VIRGE
Oh, no! Gosh, I wouldn't... Not
if you...

FAITH

Thanks. Well...
She smiles, touches his face.

FAITH
Maybe I'll pop 'round for a
hamburger some day.

She turns and goes back into the hangar. Virge starts
to go with her. She puts a hand on his arm.

FAITH
I'll go in first, if that's...

VIRGE
Oh, sure! Go right ahead.

She smiles at him, then goes into the hangar. Virge
watches her go in. Then, when he's alone, he takes a
deep breath, then howls at the moon.

19 INT. HANGAR — NIGHT

The party is in full swing. Everyone's having a great
time.

it impossible for him to join in the fun.

CUT TO:
BUFFET TABLE

Food and coffee are set out. Danny, Jack and Eugene are
eating while Rascal holds court with a group of fresh—
faced rookies. One of them, the ROOKIE, is their
spokesman.

RASCAL
That yours, that brand new plane
out there?

ROOKIE
Yeah. Mother and Country.

RASCAL
(patronizingly)
Mother and Country.
He looks at Jack and Eugene and they sigh.

RASCAL, JACK & EUGENE

Ahhh...
JACK
Ain't that sweet?
EUGENE
Brings a tear to the eye.

We had our first practice today.
DANNY
How'd it go?
ROOKIE
(smiles)

We need a couple more. If you
guys have any advice for us or
anything...

JACK
Get a gun, shoot your big toe
off and go home.

EUGENE
That's good advice.

RASCAL
Hallelujah, brother.

DANNY
Come on, guys.

Rascal puts an arm around the Rookie and looks down at
the Rookie's shiny shoes.

RASCAL
Are those size eight? How about
leaving a little will saying when
you get your ass shot off on your
first mission, those nice shiny
new pumps come to me?

The Rookie turns pale and breaks away from Rascal. He
runs out the door. Rascal chuckles.

DANNY
Rascal...

INT. LATRINE — NIGHT

Danny comes into the latrine. The fresh—faced Rookie is
bent over one of the toilet bowls, having just thrown up.
He's pale and woozy.

DANNY
You okay?

ROOKIE
Yeah. Nerves, I guess.

Danny fills a tin cup with water and takes it over to
him.

DANNY
They were just fooling around.
Don't worry about it. Everyone
gets kidding like that at first.

ROOKIE
I give anything to be in your
shoes. One more and you get to
go home.

CONTINUED:

DANNY

Sometimes I wish I could stay.
Sounds crazy, but I'm used to it
here. And the guys are like
brothers to me. I never had
brothers. Four sisters.

(laughs)
When we go back home, I don't know
when we're going to get together
again. We come from all over. I
guess that's why I keep taking
their pictures.

He looks down at his camera, winds it.

DANNY
That's the way you'll be with your
crew. Here.

Danny reaches into his breast pocket and takes out the
four—leaf clover and holds it out to the Rookie. He
takes it.

INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR — NIGHT

Danny and the Rookie join Jack, Eugene, Rascal and
Clay just as the band is ending a number.

DANNY
Clay, now's your chance! Get up
there and sing!

CLAY
Uh—huh. I'm not gonna make a
fool of myself in front of all
these folks.

EUGENE
Come on, you're a great singer.

There's a fanfare from the band. Bruce gets up onstage
and speaks into the microphone. He's enthusiastic and is
blind to the fact that what he's saying is bad luck.

BRUCE
Ladies and gentlemen... There's
ten very special men here tonight.
I'm sure you know who I mean. The
crew of the Memphis Belle.

CONTINUED:

BRUCE (CONT'D)
They're just about to become the
first crew in the Eighth Air Force
to fly their twenty—fifth and final
mission. Let's hear it for them!
Hip hip...!

CUT TO:
DANNY, CLAY, JACK AND EUGENE

unhappily watching Bruce. The Rookie starts to complete
the cheer.

ROOKIE
Hooray...

Danny grabs his arm to stop him. A couple of other
rookies have started to cheer, but they also quickly shut
up. A grim silence falls over the hangar. Bruce is
embarrassed and doesn't know what to do. Danny looks at
Clay —— a look saying "Do something." Clay quickly goes
through the crowd and steps up onstage and takes the
microphone.

CLAY
This buddy of mine keeps begging
me to sing and I guess I ain't
gonna get out of it this time.

Clay says a few words to the band leader, then turns back
to the microphone. In the meantime, Bruce quietly leaves
the stage. The band begins.

CLAY
(sings)
'Oh, Danny Boy,
The pipes, the pipes are
calling...‘

ON DANNY

He blushes and tries to escape. Jack and Eugene grab
Danny and force him to stay. The Rookie smiles, enjoying
this —— this is what Danny was talking about.

CLAY
'From glen to glen,
And down the mountain side...‘

Then suddenly, without warning, Clay and the band go

into an up—tempo, jazzy version of the song. Clay's good
—— he's a natural. Everyone starts to dance. In no time
at all the hangar is swinging again.

EXT. BASE — NIGHT

Phil is alone out in the middle of the field. The SONG
can be heard IN the DISTANCE. Phil holds a nearly full
bottle of Scotch. He looks up at the moon, diffused
through a layer of fog. He shouts.

PHIL
I don't want to die, I don't want
to die, I don't want to die...

His call fades away. He takes a long drink from the
bottle. He stumles a little, then wanders off, disap—
pearing into the fog.

EXT. BASE — DAWN

The horizon is just starting to fill with light. The fog
is gone and the clouds are breaking up.

CUT TO:
MEMPHIS BELLE

The Plexiglas of the nose, top turret and ball turret
reflect the bright sunrise. It's a B—17F, olive green
with a grey belly. On the nose, there's a painting of

a leggy woman in a bathing suit. Also, twenty—four
yellow bomb emblems and eight swastikas. The big forward
landing gear gives it a wide stance and the nose points
into the air, as if eager to take off. The plane is
huge, so huge it doesn't look like it could ever get off
the ground. It's a dramatic sight, the sun coming up
yellow and hot behind this 50 tons of machine. Men are
feverishly working on the plane, getting it ready, load—
ing the bombs, checking every detail again and again.

INT. ENLISTED MEN'S BARRACKS — DAWN

The barracks is dark. Danny is in bed, asleep. Suddenly,
a flashlight is flipped on, right in his face.

SERGEANT
Daly, rise 'n' shine. Mission
oh—eight—hundred.
Danny squints up at the pie—faced SERGEANT.

DANNY
Okay.

The Sergeant shines the flashlight in Rascal's face.

SERGEANT

RASCAL

He pulls the covers over his head. Other men are
starting to wake up, groaning, hacking.

SERGEANT
Alla yous guys, get crackin'!

Clay sits up and starts to sing.

CLAY
(sings)
'Oh, how I hate to get up in the
morning...‘

INT. OFFICERS' BARRACKS — DAWN

It is identical to the enlisted men's Nissen hut, but
less crowded with six bunks, rather than twelve. The
Sergeant shines the light in Dennis's face.

SERGEANT
Captain Dearborn, mission today.
Breakfast oh—six—hundred, briefing,
oh—six—forty—five.

Dennis wakes and looks at his wristwatch.

DENNIS
Thanks, Sergeant.

SERGEANT
Lieutenant Sinclair.

In the bed next to Dennis's Luke is already starting to
awake. His dog is sleeping beside him on the bunk.

LUKE
I'm up.

The Sergeant moves his flashlight across the aisle to
Phil's bed. It's empty.

SERGEANT

Where's Lieutenant Lowenthal?
DENNIS

Phil? I don't know. Val, where's

Phil?

(CONTINUED)

The Sergeant moves the flashlight to Val. Val quickly
improvises.

VAL
He's in the can. Couldn't sleep.
Nerves.

SERGEANT
I don't blame him. Give 'em hell
today.

DENNIS
Will do.

Dennis starts to get up. Behind his back, Val and Luke
exchange a glance. They have no idea where Phil is.

EXT. BARRACKS — DAWN

Val, dressed, comes out of the barracks. It rained
during the night and the ground is muddy. Men are
hurrying for the latrine and mess hall. Jeeps go by,
splashing mud. Val starts jogging.

EXT. BASE — DAWN

Val jogs around the perimeter track. Planes are on
their individual hardstands, with ground crews crawling
over them. Gas trucks and bomb carts come and go.
Ordinance crews are loading fat olive drab bombs into
the bellies of the planes. Armament crews are putting
boxes of ammunition in the planes and checking the gun
turrets. Val looks around for Phil, but there's no sign
of him.

EXT. AIRPLANE HANGAR — DAWN

All that remains of the dance is some beer bottles,
playing cards and cigarettes on the ground. The
hangar door is open and we can see that it has turned
back into a repair shop. A damaged B—17 is being
cannibalized for its parts. Val looks around, stumped.
Suddenly, a voice cries out.

PHIL
Bogey, six o'clock low!

Phil tackles Val from behind and knocks him to the
ground. Val scrambles out from under Phil and gets to
his feet. Phil sits in the mud, laughing.

VAL
You're drunk!

(CONTINUED)

27

29.

CONTINUED:

PHIL
(deliberately
slurring)
I rethent that inthinuation!

He takes a drink from his bottle of Scotch —— it's almost
empty.

VAL
Are you crazy? We've got a
mission!

Val grabs the bottle away from Phil, then tries to pull
Phil up. He's wasted.

PHIL
I know, that's why. I'm gonna
get it today, Val. My luck's up,
my number's run out. I mean...
(giggles)
I'm gonna die and I want to give
you something to remember me by.

He takes off his watch.

VAL
I don't want that piece of crap.
You've got to get hold of yourself.
Everybody's counting on you...

Arm around Phil, he starts leading him back to the
barracks.

PHIL
You want my cufflinks? They've
got my initials.

VAL
Phil, you're going to let everyone
down...

PHIL

How about my whole set of New York
Yankee baseball cards? Nah, then
you'll just remember the Yankees
and forget about me.

Phil continues to ramble as Val leads him away.

PHIL
I know, my fountain pen! You
could use it to fill out
prescriptions and stuff. Or you
name it, Val. Anything you want.
My dog tags? You want my dog
tags or my Boy Scout knife?

50.
INT. LATRINE — DAY

There are men in here, shaving, sleepily getting ready
for the mission. Val and Luke watch Phil weave towards
a stall. He misses the door and bumps into the doorjamb.

LUKE
That's our navigator.

Phil disappears into the stall.

VAL
We better tell Dennis he's sick
and get someone else.

LUKE
We can't! A new man's bad luck.
VAL
What's a drunk navigator, good
luck?
LUKE
So, you're the doctor. Sober him
up.
VAL
He's going to endanger every man
in that...
LUKE

Come on, he's not so bad. He's
just a little high.

Sound of a TRICKLE from the stall. Val glances at his
watch.

VAL
I timed that. Forty—five seconds
to find his own dick.
Val and Luke look at each other.
INT. LATRINE STALL

Val bends Phil over the toilet.

VAL
Stick your finger down your
throat.
Phil shakes his head.
VAL

Do it or I'll do it for you.

CONTINUED:

Phil tries to get away. Val shoves him up against the
wall, pries open his mouth and sticks his own finger
down Phil's throat. Phil gags and vomits, right on
Val's shirt and tie.

INT. ENLISTED MEN'S BARRACKS

The enlisted men are getting dressed and shaving. Danny
takes a picture of the hut, and the men groan. The men
are tense, nervous, but they cover their anxiety with
jokes and foolishness.

JACK
I can see it. I get back home,
I'm making love to my wife, the
door breaks open and it's Danny,
taking a fucking picture!

Danny laughs. He turns his camera on Eugene, who's
searching his bunk, in a state of near panic.

EUGENE
Anybody seen my St. Anthony medal?

DANNY
Isn't he the patron saint of
missing things?

EUGENE
Yeah, I can't find him!

Danny takes the picture.
INT. LATRINE

Val is shaving Phil, who's shivering, a wreck. Val's

shirt is wet —— he has washed off the vomit. Luke comes
in.
LUKE
Coast's clear. Dennis went for
chow.

Phil pulls a Boy Scout knife out of his pocket.

PHIL
Luke, I want you to have my
penknife. It's real nice.

LUKE
Keep it. If Dennis sees you like
this, you'll need it to cut your
throat with.

Luke rips open a little packet and empties it in Phil's
mouth.

LUKE
Sen—sen.

INT. BARRACKS

Danny takes the bottle of champagne from his locker.
Rascal snatches it away from him.

RASCAL
You're not thinking of sneaking
this on the plane, are you?
Danny, I am shocked. And Virge
goes out for the pass!

He tosses it across the room to Virge.

DANNY
Don't!

JACK
Hey, wiseguys, cut the crap!

EUGENE
I found it!

He finds his St. Anthony medal under his bed. He slips
the chain over his head, kisses the medallion and falls
to his knees to say a little prayer. Rascal and Virge
continue to play keepaway from Danny, annoying the other
men.

INT. OFFICERS' BARRACKS

Phil is dressed and Val is tying his shoes. Phil
hiccups.

VAL
Stop it!

Phil hiccups again. Just then, a quick KNOCK, the door
opens and Dennis comes in.

DENNIS
There you are, Phil. I just want
to remind you both to keep quiet
about you know what.

VAL
What? Oh, sure.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Phil nods.

DENNIS
Okay. See you at briefing.

He goes out, closing the door behind him.

VAL
(to Phil)
You did good.

Phil lets out a loud hiccup he'd been saving up.
INT. MESS HALL

It's crowded and smoky. The enlisted men are jammed
together on one side of the hall. The officers have
more space on their side. Val and Phil are going down
the line. A tough Army COOK is serving eggs, bacon and
pancakes.

COOK
We're counting on you today, sirs.
Kick Hitler's butt.

VAL
Give him extra. He's real hungry.

The Cook heaps some more eggs on the plate. Phil
watches, nauseated.

CUT TO:
CLAY, VIRGE, EUGENE, JACK, RASCAL AND DANNY

are crowded at a table, all smoking and drinking coffee.
Jack is the only one eating.

JACK
These powdered eggs would gag a
buzzard.

He takes Virge's plate and scrapes the eggs onto his
plate and eats those, too. Luke and Dennis come over.

DENNIS
How are we doing this morning,
men?

Luke puts a hammerhold on Rascal's neck.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

RASCAL
Stop it! You won't have a chance
to do that after today, Luke, sir.

LUKE
I wouldn't be so sure. Right,
Dennis?

Suddenly, across the room, a CRASH and CLATTER. Everyone
looks. Val is scurrying to retrieve a box of silverware
Phil knocked over. Dennis watches. Luke watches Dennis.

DENNIS
I guess we've all got the jitters
this morning. See you after
briefing.

Dennis walks off. Luke breathes a sigh of relief.
INT. BRIEFING ROOM

Up front, a small stage. On stage, a board covered by
a curtain. On the left side, a spool of red yarn, the
yarn leading behind the curtain. The room is crowded,
noisy and smoky. Val escorts Phil to a seat in the
back. He's nearly comatose. Luke comes up to them,
holding his dog, a brown and white speckled mutt.

LUKE
How the hell's he going to get
through the navigator's briefing
afterwards?

VAL
On a wing and a fucking prayer.

Val and Phil sit. Luke leaves them to take his seat
down front with Dennis.

CUT TO:
DANNY AND ROOKIE
sitting across the aisle with the other radio operators.
ROOKIE
I thought we'd have a little more

practice before we went up.

DANNY
You'll do fine.

(CONTINUED)

55.
CONTINUED:

Danny takes out a couple of pencils and gives the Rookie
one, then turns to a fresh sheet in his notebook.
Suddenly, a sharp voice calls out.

VOICE (O.S.)
Tenn—hut!

Everyone rises to attention. The CO steps up on stage.

CO
At ease, gentlemen.

Murmuring and shuffling as everyone sits.

CO
I hope you all had a good time
last night. But now it's back to
business. The target for today
is...

The S—2 pulls back the curtain to reveal a map of
Northern Europe. The red yarn extends from East Anglia
all the way across the North Sea, then turns sharply
and penetrates into Germany.

CO
Bremen.

The room erupts into disbelief, gasps, groans, nervous
laughter. First we see Dennis and Luke, then Phil and
Val, then Danny and the Rookie, all looking at the map
in shock. They weren't expecting this.

EXT. BRIEFING ROOM

The CO hurries out of the briefing room. Bruce is
waiting for him.

BRUCE

(angrily)
Are you crazy? Bremen's one of
the most heavily—defended cities
in Germany! They'll get blown out
of the sky. You've got to pull
the Memphis Belle from this
mission.

CO
No.

BRUCE
I need those men. This whole
public relations junket depends...

CO
(interrupting)
I have orders to put every plane
in the sky that I can.

BRUCE
Craig, if we present a united
front, the two of us, we can get
the Belle pulled. You talk to
H.Q. I'll talk to Washington.

CO
I promised General Eaker 24 planes
today. I lost one yesterday. The
Memphis Belle has to go.

BRUCE
You don't really care if those men
live or die, do you? They're just
another plane to you. Just so you
can reach your quota.

CO
Colonel, I'm in command here and
I've made my decision!

BRUCE
Your decision is inhuman and
irresponsible, and I'm going to
make sure everybody knows about
it, starting with General Eaker.

Bruce turns and jogs across the base, dodging a Jeep as
he goes. The CO watches him go.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM

The lights are off. A large blown—up photograph is
projected on the screen: an aerial view of a railyard,
a river snaking through, some trees and houses. The
S—2 taps a large, square building in the center of the
photo with his pointer. He taps it three times.

S—2
This is our target right here.
It's a square building, the only
square one in the area, so you
can't miss it. Note these
railroad tracks on the east and
this long, rectangular building
on the north. That's a hospital.
These are houses here. This is a
school and a playground.

ON VAL

He's watching very carefully. This is his department.
He stares at the picture, trying to memorize every
detail. Beside him, Phil is fast asleep.

EXT. LOCKER ROOM

The room is filled with men in various stages of dress,
Rascal, Clay, Jack, Eugene and Virge among them. They
wear long underwear next to their skin, then bright blue
heated suits over that. Pants and blouse over that.
Then a leather flight jacket with a long extension cord
sticking out. The blue bunny suits plug into the waist
of the flight jacket. Thick, fleece—lined boots and
gloves are next, a wool scarf, a helmet, and, finally,
a Mae West, a deflated yellow life jacket. Rascal is
fully—dressed and looks a little stocky with all these
clothes on. Clay is just pulling on his long underwear
and he sings as he does it.

CLAY
(sings)
'I'm putting on my top hat,
Tying up my white tie,
Brushing off my tails...‘

RASCAL
There he goes, the human jukebox.

Clay buttons up the front of his underwear.

CLAY
(sings)
'I'm duding up my shirt front,
Putting in the shirt studs,
Polishing my nails...‘

INT. BRIEFING ROOM

The CO is now standing on the stage. The room is silent.
He speaks with quiet force and feeling, but careful not
to let his anxiety and anguish show.

CO
Today they've given us a chance to
really make a difference in this
war. Let's do this job the best
we can and leave the rest in the
hands of God.

you're back. Each and every one
of you. Dismissed.

INT. CO'S OFFICE
Bruce is yelling into the phone.

BRUCE
I've talked to six different
people and been cut off twice! I
want General Eaker on this phone
now or I want your name, Corporal.
I'll hold, but you better not cut
me...

A second, then he jiggles the cradle. He's been cut off.
INT. BRIEFING ROOM

The navigator's briefing is in progress. In the back,
two lines: one for radio operators (Danny and the Rookie
in this one) and one for bombardiers. Val is lined up to
receive his flimsies, Luke with him. They're both watch—
ing Phil. The GROUP NAVIGATOR drones on in the b.g.

GROUP NAVIGATOR
You'll have nil to 5/10 low clouds
at takeoff with visibility one to
two miles. You'll assemble over
the field at 5,000 feet...

VAL
So far, so good.

ON PHIL

He's awake and paying attention. Then we see why. He's
jabbing the sharp point of his compass into his forearm.
It's spotted with blood.

EXT. BASE

Clay, Eugene, Jack, Virge and Rascal are piled into the
back of a Jeep parked on the edge of the perimeter track.
They stare at Danny in shock.

VIRGE

Shut up, Rascal!

RASCAL
You shut up, Virgin!

EUGENE
Cut it out. Clay, what're the
odds today?

CLAY
(calmly, objectively)

Well, they'll overload us with
bombs, so it's about thirty to

one we'll crash and blow up on
takeoff. Then, they're going to
throw every fighter they've got at
us, so, five to one against us
even getting to Bremen. Then,
you've got your flak batteries...

JACK
Skip the gory details.

CLAY
Basically, we're fucked.

Then Dennis walks up, Luke, Val and Phil behind him.
As soon as the enlisted men see Dennis they smile and
try to look innocent and happy to be going to Bremen.
Without a word, Dennis gets in the front seat of the
Jeep and the enlisted men make room for the other
officers.

EXT. FIELD

They're all in the Jeep, some seated, others hanging on
to the back or sides. They're being driven across the
field. Luke's DOG runs along with the Jeep, BARKING.

EXT. SOUTHERN BELLE

The Jeep halts at the plane. The crew gets up and
starts for the hatches. The ground crew is doing a
final check, crawling all over the plane. Les is
supervising.

INT. COCKPIT

Hundreds of dials and switches on the instrument panel.
More gadgets on the left and right walls. Between the
pilot and co—pilot seats is a pedestal with the ignition
switches, engine controls and throttles. Below that,
another box with switches and wheels controlling the trim
tabs, elevators and rudders. Luke sits in the co—pilot
seat. He plugs in his intercom and speaks.

LUKE
Soon as you're ready, call in.

INT. NOSE

The front of the nose is Plexiglas. There are two guns
on the sides, right and left. Under the right gun, an
intricate panel of bombing instruments. There are more
instruments, dials, gauges and buttons —— including the
bomb release switch —— on the left. Val takes the canvas
cover off a complicated device in the very tip of the
nose: the Norden bombsight. He wipes it carefully with
a cloth.

VAL
Bombardier checking in.

Phil is behind him at a little desk that juts out of the
left wall. Above and behind his desk is more equipment:
hoses, gauges, compasses. In the ceiling, a small
Plexiglas dome. Phil very neatly arranges his pencils,
compasses, rulers, maps, flimsies, log book —— everything
in its place.

PHIL
Navigator checking in.

INT. TOP TURRET

Directly behind the cockpit is a small platform where
Virge stands. He's checking his twin .50 caliber machine
guns in the top turret. They stick out of a small
Plexiglas bubble in the roof. The TURRET is
hydraulically—operated with hand controls; it WHINES and
CLANKS as it rotates. Directly behind the top turret is
the bomb bay.

VIRGE
Top turret checking in.

Behind the bomb bay is Danny's radio room. He has a desk
against the left forward bulkhead.

His radio receivers, transmitters and Morse code key are
on the desk. Additional equipment is on little shelves
bolted to the right bulkheads, fore and aft. A .50
caliber machine gun points out of a small window in the
ceiling —— Danny's gun. Danny has his headphones on,
his codebooks open, and is making notations in his log
book. His box camera is also on the desk. On his wrist
he wears a big red rubber band.

DANNY
Radio operator checking in.

INT. BALL TURRET AREA

An area that contains the top of the ball turret. Rascal
is checking his ammunition boxes.

RASCAL
Ball turret checking in.

INT. WAIST

There are two large open windows on either side of the
plane. The plane has tapered and is much narrower towards
the back. Jack and Eugene are on their respective sides
of the fuselage, checking their guns and ammo. When in
action, Jack and Eugene are hip to hip, with no room to
spare.

EUGENE
Right waist gunner checking in.

JACK
Left waist checking in.

INT. TAIL

The tail gun position is very cramped. There's only room
for one man and he has to kneel in front of his twin
.50s. His head sticks up into a rectangular box with
small windows in it, providing maximum view and minimum
protection. Clay adjusts the rope of ammunition which
leads from the ammo box to the guns. Clay's lucky
horseshoe hangs on the left.

CLAY
Tail gunner checking in.

In this section we should have the sense that each crew
member knows his job inside out and gives it his fullest
attention. No horsing around now.

Virge jumps down from the top turret and crouches behind
the control box. Then he taps Dennis on the shoulder
and points. Racing towards them across the tarmac is a
Jeep. Dennis opens his side window. The Jeep slows and
a LIEUTENANT yells up to Dennis.

LIEUTENANT
Captain, there's a delay. We've
got a 9/10ths cloud cover over the
target. But there's a strong wind
and we're hoping it'll blow over.
Stand by your plane until further
notice.

DENNIS
How long?

LIEUTENANT
They don't tell me doodly, sir.

The Jeep pulls away. Luke pounds the control column in
frustration.

Luke is unplugging his interphone cord and taking off his
headset. Virge is still crouched behind the control
box. Dennis speaks over the interphone.

DENNIS
Gentlemen, we're stood down for a
while. Let's take the extra time
to double—double check everything.
Let's make this mission our best
one yet.

Virge steps up into the top turret. Luke starts getting
up from his seat.

DENNIS
Okay, Luke, let's do the pre—
flight check again. Fuel Transfer
Valves.

They're still off!

DENNIS
Intercoolers.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

Phil drops out of the forward hatch and walks under the
belly of the plane. He hoists himself up onto the left
wing, lies down, puts a parachute under his head as a
pillow and closes his eyes.

EXT. FARM

At the edge of the airfield, a hedgerow and beyond it, a
farmhouse, crops, some sheep grazing. Clay calls across
to a ruddy FARMER, who's trying to repair an ancient
horse—pulled combine baler.

CLAY
Busted?

FARMER
It's no use, Yank. This thing's
old as the hills and there's not
a spare part to be found these
days.

CLAY
I've got one just like it at
home. Let me take a look.

Clay goes to a gap in the hedgerow where part of a roll
of barbed wire is stuck. Clay pulls it out and steps
through the hedge.

and throws a stick to his dog, who chases it.

Luke is frustrated and impatient with the stand—down.
This whole section has anxiety and tension to it. Are
they going up or not? Why is it always "hurry up and

wait?"

LUKE
All you do is call up on the
intercom and say you're having
trouble in the tail. I'll come
back and you let me have the gun
for five minutes.

CLAY
It's against regulations.

LUKE
Screw regulations. This is my
last chance. How am I going to
get girls when I go back home if
I haven't killed a single Nazi?

CLAY
If they found out, they'd put my
hot dog in a bun and chow down.

LUKE
Nobody's going to find out. It's
just between us. I'll do anything
you say. Name your price.

The dog charges back with the stick and jumps into Luke's
arms.

CLAY
Give me your dog.

Luke looks at Clay, speechless.
62 EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

Virge and Rascal by the ball turret. Virge is putting
his tools back in the toolbox. Frustrated by the
hiatus, Virge and Rascal are on each other's nerves more
than ever.

RASCAL
You're flight engineer...

VIRGE
I'm flight engineer when we're in

VIRGE

I checked it, top to bottom. It's
okay. Take it easy, Rascal.

Virge picks up his toolbox and starts to walk away.

RASCAL
Gee, thanks, Virgin.
VIRGE
The name is Virgil.
RASCAL
Not to me.
VIRGE
You know, Rascal, I could tell you
something.
RASCAL

What? Tell me, Virgin.

Virge hesitates. He'd love to tell Rascal and get him
off his back. But he can't —— he promised Faith.

VIRGE
Nothing.

He walks away. Rascal continues worrying over the turret.

OMITTED

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

It has clouded up a bit. It's quiet. The crew is
gathered on the left side of the plane. Phil is still
asleep on the wing. Dennis is looking over his flimsies
and Clay is whittling a model of the Belle out of soft,
white wood. The other guys are nervous, anxious, jumpy.
Val is compulsively doing sit—ups, one after another.

Rascal can't keep still, he's drumming his fingers on
his knees, bouncing his legs up and down, etc. Eugene
is running his St. Anthony medal up and down its chain
while Jack is doing sleight of hand, pulling sticks of
gum out of Eugene's nose and ears. Luke is fooling
around with his dog. Danny is writing in a composition
book. Virge is oiling and cleaning the tools in his
toolbox. One slips out of his hand and drops into the
box with a clang. Eugene, Jack and Rascal jump.

RASCAL
Jesus!
EUGENE
Virge, do you have to?
VIRGE
Sorry, I just...
EUGENE
(to Jack)
Stop it! Leave me alone!
CLAY
Seven to one we're not going.
VAL
Let's just go. Just get it over
with.
JACK

I'd rather get it over by going
to a nice little French target.

RASCAL
Yeah, so if we have to bail out,
we could hide in some little
French girl's hayloft.

VIRGE
Is that all you think about,
Rascal?

RASCAL

Gotta make up for you, Virgin.
Take up the slack.

Virge shoves him. Rascal goes for him. Eugene grabs
Rascal, Clay grabs Virge.

DENNIS
Okay, men, calm down. Getting
excited isn't going to do any
good. Relax. Be more like Phil.

Luke and Val exchange a look —— if Dennis only knew.
Then Jack grabs Danny's composition book.

JACK
What're you writing, Danny Boy?
Poetry! We have a poet on the
plane!

EUGENE
Give it back, King Kong.

Eugene snatches the book from Jack, tosses it to Clay,
who tosses it to Virge, who gives it back to Danny.

VAL

Read us something you wrote, Danny.
DANNY

No...
RASCAL

I wanna hear some poetry!

VIRGE
Come on, come on.

DANNY
Nothing's finished.

DENNIS
Don't be shy, Danny.

Jack takes out his harmonica and starts playing a little
of "Danny Boy." Danny blushes. They all look at him,
waiting. Reluctantly, Danny opens his book.

CLOSE SHOT — NOTEBOOK

Everything is crossed out. He turns a page or two. Same
thing, everything is crossed out.

ON DANNY

Everyone is watching him. He looks down at the book and
pretends to read. He starts nervously.

DANNY
'I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above;
Those that I fight I do not hate,
Those that I guard I do not
love...‘

He hesitates. They're listening. It's very quiet, just
the harmonica. Danny recites from memory.

DANNY
'Nor law, nor duty bade me fight,‘
'Nor public men, nor cheering
crowds,
A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the

clouds;

I balanced all, brought all to
mind,

The years to come seemed waste of
breath,

A waste of breath the years behind,
In balance with this life, this
death.‘

Long, long silence. The words have expressed the feel—
ings of each of these men, the attraction to the fight
and the fear of it; the threat of death and the excite—
ment of its closeness. We FOCUS ON Dennis —— he's
particularly struck by the poem. This is a moment
suspended in time —— then it's abruptly broken when the
JEEP races up, SKIDS to a halt and the Lieutenant yells
to Dennis.

LIEUTENANT
Captain, you're going up!
Takeoff's in five minutes!

The Jeep speeds away. The men quickly grab their clothes
and equipment and start towards the hatches. Val shakes

Phil awake and helps him down from the wing. Clay pulls

on his jacket and speaks to Luke.

CLAY
Okay, Lieutenant, it's a deal.

LUKE
I'm not giving you my dog.

CLAY
I don't want that flea—bitten,
mangy pooch anyway.

Clay jogs off to the waist hatch. Luke puts the dog
down, pats him, then also heads for the waist hatch. The
dog watches him go, then charges across the field toward
the control tower.

LUKE
Are you kidding? Go! I can't

He grabs the clipboard and pencil from Dennis.

LUKE

He starts going through the checklist for the third time.
EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY

The CO nods to the S—2, who points a flare GUN in the air
and FIRES. A green flare shoots up.

INT. COCKPIT
Dennis flips a switch on the pilot's control panel.
EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The prop on ENGINE one begins turning, then COUGHS and
BELCHES a white cloud of smoke. The prop whirls into
invisibility.

INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny is sitting at his desk, tuning his radio, making
notes and eating a candy bar. Rascal and Clay are sit—
ting on the floor against the left aft bulkhead. Rascal
compulsively shuffles a deck of cards. Clay is whittling
again. Jack and Eugene sit against the right aft bulk—
head. Jack practices his magic on Eugene, making a coin
disappear, then pulling it out of Eugene's nose. Eugene
is praying and tries to brush Jack away. But Jack per—

them up and puts them in place, then his maps slide to
the floor again.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

ENGINE THREE WHIRLS into action. Then ENGINE FOUR STARTS
UP. ENGINES are POUNDING, rattling the ground all over
the field.

EXT. CONTROL TOWER BALCONY

The CO is on the control tower balcony, watching the
scene through binoculars. Bruce comes out of the control
room, steamed that his efforts to stop the Belle have
failed.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

Les signals to the ground crew to pull the chocks out
from under the front wheels. As two members of the
ground crew do it, we see them up CLOSE, then we PULL
BACK WITH them and the plane is revealed with all four
ENGINES POUNDING, props whirling with tremendous speed
and power. The plane begins to move forward.

EXT. BASE

The ROAR of ENGINES is deafening as twenty—two planes
start moving off the hardstands onto the runways, getting
into position for takeoff. There's no turning back now.
The sheer mechanical and human effort to get to this
point is monumental, exciting. Once they're in line,

we see them FROM ABOVE —— plane after plane after plane
after plane, ENGINES ROARING, the air wrinkled with their
fumes, waiting to go.

EXT. RUNWAY

The lead plane, Windy City, opens its throttles and
hurtles down the runway and soars into the sky, surpris—
ingly graceful. Then another plane, Mama's Boys, charges
down the runway and takes off. Then a third plane,

C CUP, ROARS down the runway and takes off.

OMITTED

EXT. RUNWAY

The Memphis Belle starts down the runway. We TRACK WITH
it, keeping pace as it picks up speed, steadily, smoothly.
The wheels start to lift off the runway. The plane,

which has seemed too heavy to ever get off the ground,
takes to the air gracefully, naturally. It soars.
Finally, we can't keep up with it and we watch as it

flies off into the horizon, its ROAR DIMINISHING and
leaving us with silence and an empty feeling. We can't
help them now. They're on their own.

EXT. HARDSTAND

Les and the ground crew watch the plane until it's gone.
They feel helpless. Les, exhausted from working twenty—
four hours to get to this moment, turns away and picks
up his bicycle from the ground. He starts to ride back
to the barracks.

INT. COCKPIT

We're inside now. We're rising fast and flying towards

And we enter the cloud. Visibility is gone. There's

blind. It's terrifying. There's silence, just the ROAR
of the PLANE. Then, abruptly, without warning, another
huge B—l7 appears right in FRONT of us! We're going to
crash into its left wing. There is no way to avoid the
collision.

LUKE
Look out!

Luke ducks. Dennis pushes on the control wheel. He
does this calmly, without panic. The nose of the Belle
suddenly drops down and Virge is thrown off—balance and
falls hard to the floor. The other PLANE ROARS directly
overhead. When it's clear, Dennis straightnes out the
plane. This all happens so fast, it's over before we
know it —— but it's hair—raising and an ominous premo—
nition of what's to come. Luke comes up from his tuck,
amazed they're still in the air. Virge picks himself up
then touches his forehead. There's a little gash and he
gets blood on his fingers.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The plane breaks out above the clouds into dazzling blue
sky and bright sun. It's spectacularly beautiful.
Another plane comes up on its left: Baby Ruth.

hot liquid into the cup. Dennis offers the cup to Virge.

DENNIS

Virge shakes his head. The cut on his forehead has
dried.

INT. WAIST

A fierce WIND BLOWS in constantly through the open waist
windows. Jack unlashes his gun and strokes it, fondly.

JACK
Okay, Mona, let's get us a nice
little 109 today. We got one,

EUGENE
Sweet—talking your gun won't help,
Jack. Just straight shooting.

JACK
Butt out, Gene.

EUGENE
You know, when I got my two Nazi
fighters...

JACK

You're asking for it!

Eugene turns to his side, chuckling. Jack clips him in
the back of the legs with his knees, making Eugene
crumple and stagger. Jack laughs.

INT. BARRACKS

The room is a mess. Les looks around. He closes a
locker that was left ajar. He picks up an undershirt
lying on the floor, folds it and places it on a bed.
Picks up a pair of boots and sets them under another
bunk. He starts tucking in the rumpled covers of another
bed.

Baby Ruth is flying tight on the left and now the brand
new plane, Mother and Country, comes up on the right.

Val yanks out his intercom cord and starts towards the
back of the nose. Phil pulls off a class ring from his
finger and holds it out.

PHIL
Val, take this.

VAL
Phil, you're not going to die.

PHIL
Just in case.

VAL
You're flak happy. We took a big
chance on you. Just do your job
wdsmmlm!

He doesn't take the ring. He brushes past Phil and goes
up the hatch to the cockpit.

INT. BOMB BAY

Val stands on the narrow catwalk running the length of
the bay. There are eight bombs, four on each side ——
olive drab bombs with three thin yellow bands. Val eases
the cotter pin from the nose of one of the bombs. He
looks at the bomb, then pats it a little as if to calm

it down.

INT. BALL TURRET AREA

Virge is helping Rascal drop down into the ball turret
through the entry hatch.

VIRGE

Rascal disappears into the turret. Virge closes the
hatch on his back.

INT. BALL TURRET

Rascal is curled into the womb—like turret. His legs are
spread and his feet are set on pedals which control the
movement of the turret. There are small windows on each
side and one large circular window of armored glass in
front. He has no room at all. It's claustrophobic.

At the same time, the turret is insubstantial, as if
Rascal weren't in the plane at all, just tenuously
clinging to its belly. He presses the foot pedals,
spinning the turret around, testing it.

INT. COCKPIT

Ahead and slightly above the Belle is the first flight:
Windy City in the center, Mama's Boys on its left,
C Cup on its right. Luke is fastening his oxygen mask.

LUKE
We're at ten thousand feet. Let's
hear your oxygen checks. Clay,
how are you doing back there?

INT. TAIL

Clay is kneeling in front of his twin guns, looking down
on the formation spread out above and below. Planes for
miles. He fastens his oxygen mask tight over his nose
and mouth, then checks the gauge to make sure oxygen is
flowing.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

First we see the Memphis Belle, flying steady and level.
Then we PULL BACK to see its two wingmen, Baby Ruth and
Mother and Country flying tight on the left and right.
We CONTINUE PULLING BACK FURTHER AND FURTHER, REVEALING
more and more planes —— B—l7s stacked up all over the sky.
The formation is composed of three groups, each group
containing eighteen planes. Memphis Belle is in the
first group. Within the first group there are three
squadrons: high, lead and low. Memphis Belle is in the
lead squadron. The high squadron is above it, behind
and to the left. The low squadron is below and to the
right. Each squadron consists of six planes, divided
into two flights. The first flight flies above and
ahead of the second. In our squadron, the first flight
is Windy City, Mama's Boys and C Cup. Memphis Belle is
the lead plane of the second flight, with Baby Ruth and
Mother and Country as its left and right wingmen.
Altogether, there are nearly 500 planes in the air, a
majestic sight. Contrails —— wide, beautiful strips of
vapor —— are streaming from their engines. Below, the
deep green land ends in a white coastline. From then on,
nothing but grey sea.

INT. WAIST

Jack and Eugene are at their guns, watching the sky
tensely for fighters. Dennis's voice comes over the
INTERCOM.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Listen, men, I'm showing thirty
below zero up here, so keep your
gloves on. Don't touch your gun
with your bare hands or you'll
freeze right to it. I don't want
anyone losing any fingers.

INT. BALL TURRET

Rascal spins the TURRET around, testing it. It turns
smoothly, with a high HYDRAULIC WHINE. He raises and
lowers his guns. He's still worried about the turret,
almost trying to find something wrong.

RASCAL
In short, don't drool.

DENNIS (V.O.)
In short, check your masks.

INT. NOSE

Phil takes off his watch and sets it down on top of his
maps, where other items are laid out: his dog tags,
rabbit's foot, class ring and baseball cards which have
black and white photos of the Yankees on them. He's
trying to decide who gets what. Val is in the front of
the nose, checking the bombsight.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Keep the intercom free and call
out those fighters. Make it
short and sweet.

PHIL

This is for Virge. No, Clay.
This is for Virge.

DENNIS (V.O.)

Danny flips a switch. The voices of GEORGE BURNS and
GRACIE ALLEN are clear.

GRACIE (V.O.)

back yard circus, just like we did
when I was a kid.

GEORGE (V.O.)

GRACIE (V.O.)
Yes. Of course, admission was
free, but that was only for
people who could afford it.

Audience laughter. Danny laughs, too.

Phil is still trying to figure out who gets what. He

she was supposed to put it in a
basket and then blow on a flute
until the snake stuck its head up.

INT. WAIST

Jack is behind his gun, watching the sky and eager to
get into action. Eugene has made a sign on the back of
an old flimsy and now puts two pieces of electrical
tape on it.

GRACIE (V.O.)

one Saturday afternoon?

GEORGE (V.O.)
She put the flute in the basket
and blew on the snake.

GRACIE (V.O.)
Wasn't that awful!

Jack laughs. Eugene laughs with Jack and slaps him on
the back, attaching the sign without Jack knowing it.
It reads, "COULDN'T GET LAID LAST NIGHT!"

A loud burst of STATIC. Danny adjusts the RADIO, but
the static won't go away.

GRACIE (V.O.)

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

P—47 Thunderbolts streak across the sky above the
formation, like fat hummingbirds. They're careful not
to point their noses at or fly directly into the for—

These one—seat fighters have a single propeller mounted
in a round, blunt nose with a white ring around the
cowling. They have eight machine gun barrels, four

Phil is here, with Jack and Eugene. He has a small,
light oxygen tank slung over his shoulder on a strap.
It has eight minutes of air in it. Whenever the men
move around the plane for any length of time, they use
these little tanks, taking a hit of oxygen when they
need it. Both Jack and Eugene have their masks off to
talk. Phil hands Eugene a fountain pen.

PHIL
It's the best pen money can buy.
EUGENE
Why can't I have the baseball
cards?
PHIL

They're for Jack. Here, Jack.

He hands Jack the baseball cards. Jack looks longingly
at the fountain pen.

JACK
I'm really more of a football
fan myself.

Angrily, Phil grabs the pen from Eugene, thrusts it at
Jack, then takes the cards and gives them to Eugene.
He shouts at them.

PHIL
Happy?

He turns and stomps out of the room.
INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny is changing the film in his camera when he hears
the ROOKIE'S VOICE on the RADIO.

ROOKIE (V.O.)
Mother and Country calling
Memphis Belle. Come in.
Danny flips a switch on the radio.

DANNY
Read you, Mother. What's wrong?

Danny looks out his right window. Mother and Country can
be seen, flying very close. We might even see the
Rookie's head.

ROOKIE (V.O.)
Nothing, Danny, I just had a
question.

DANNY
We're not supposed to use the
radio unless it's an emergency.

ROOKIE (V.O.)
Oh, sorry. It was just about my
log book, whether I should write
down every radio communication I
hear or just...

DANNY
Write down everything at first.
Then later on... Look, we better

sign off.

ROOKIE (V.O.)
Okay. Thanks, Danny. I won't
bother you again.

Danny has wound his camera. He stands up and aims it out
the right radio room window.

DANNY
I'm taking your picture. Smile.

Danny snaps the picture.
INT. NOSE

Phil extends the line on his map out across the North
Sea. His hand shakes and the line goes wobbly.

DENNIS (V.O.)
We're getting close to enemy
territory. Be on guard. Call
out those fighters soon as you
see them.

INT. WAIST
Jack is alert, tense, checking the sky for fighters.

CONTINUED:

He checks from eight to ten o'clock, high and low. He
still isn't aware of the sign on his back. Eugene also
watches the sky, nervously. His duty is two o'clock to
four o'clock, high and low.

EUGENE
Clay, you really sang great last
night. You should do like we keep
saying. After the war go to
to Hollywood and get a record
contract like Frank Sinatra.

JACK
Yeah, so we can say we knew you
when.

OMITTED
INT. TAIL

Clay has a bird's eye view of the formation, spread out
in perfect "Vs" across the sky. It's a spectacular
sight. Clay is whittling his model plane. He looks up
occasionally for fighters —— his area is mainly four to
eight o'clock low.

CLAY
Nah. I'm gonna get a nice little
farm and a nice little wife and
settle down.

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis is intently flying the plane. Luke is, as usual,
sitting beside him with nothing to do.

CLAY (V.O.)
Luke's the one should go to
Hollywood. He could star in the
movies.

LUKE
Maybe, maybe. I don't know what
I'm going to do after the war.
Except not work.

RASCAL
Yeah, Luke, why go back to the
daily grind of being a lifeguard?
Take it easy!

INT. TOP TURRET

Virge is slowly turning in his turret, watching the upper
sky, all hours of the clock.

VIRGE
It's not stupid! At least I've
got a plan. What are you going
to do after the war, Rascal?

RASCAL (V.O.)
Come to your restaurant and rob
it!

INT. NOSE

Val is behind his gun on the right front side of the
nose. He's searching the sky, twelve to three o'clock
high and low. Phil is on his gun on the left side,
checking the sky nine to twelve, high and low.

JACK (V.O.)
Val's the smart one. He's almost
a doctor already. What kind of
doctor are you going to be, Val?

VAL
A rich one. What about Phil?
What should he be after the
war?

Nerves on edge, Phil looks at Val.

VAL
Wait. I've got it. A mortician!

Val cackles with laughter. Phil doesn't think it's
funny at all. He turns away.

INT. COCKPIT

Above and ahead, the first flight can be seen, still
streaming contrails from their engines.

Silence.

DENNIS
Fellas, think about this. My
family has a furniture business.
We make furniture, sell it. You
can all come work for me.

DENNIS
Like I said, don't give it a
thought.

LUKE

That's just what we need, you
ordering us around the rest of
our lives. 'Do the pre—flight
check!‘

RASCAL (V.O.)
'Don't hog the intercom!‘

VIRGE (V.O.)
'Keep your gloves on!‘

DANNY (V.O.)
'Check your masks!‘

JACK (V.O.)
'Call out those fighters!‘

CLAY (V.O.)
'Let's make this our best one
yet!‘

VAL (V.O.)

'Right in the pickle barrel!‘

Laughter all around the plane.

DENNIS
I'm not that bad.

INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny is behind his gun. He watches the sky from four
to eight, high.

Clay, I don't really like talking
about it. I mean, what if
something happens...

(hesitates)
What I mean is, it just seems so
far away, that's all.

A silence as the men think about how far away the end
of the war really is. Now Danny feels bad for spoiling
the mood.

DANNY
I'm sorry, guys.

Suddenly, Eugene's voice calls out, sharply.

EUGENE (V.O.)
Bandits, five o'clock high!

INT. WAIST

Eugene swings his gun towards the rear and aims at two
tiny specks in the sky. He's already nervous, jumpy.

INT. TOP TURRET

Virge spins his turret to five o'clock and sights in the
fighters with his two big .50 calibers, excited and
anxious.

INT. TAIL

Clay, calm as ever, puts down his penknife and model
plane, takes hold of his guns and aims them at five
o'clock.

INT. COCKPIT

Luke looks out his window. The Thunderbolts are peeling
off to chase the fighters.

LUKE
Go get 'em, little friends!

DENNIS
Hold your fire till Gerry's
in range. Don't waste
ammunition.

INT. WAIST
Eugene OPENS FIRE at the fighters, still far away.

DENNIS (V.O.)
I said, hold your fire!

Eugene stops firing.

JACK
That was Geenie the weenie.

Jack laughs and looks at Eugene. Eugene fakes a kick
to Jack's groin. Jack doesn't even flinch, he just
laughs.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The Thunderbolts and German fighters rush at each other
at a combined speed of over 600 m.p.h., FIRING away.
Just when the fighters seem about to collide, the
Thunderbolts peel away and soar off into the sky. The
M—109s keep coming. They're smaller and more sleek than
the Thunderbolts, like cigars with wings. They can do
anything they want.

INT. WAIST
Jack is excited and eager; Eugene nervous and jittery.

CLAY (V.O.)
They're a—comin'.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Call them out.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Six o'clock high!

JACK
Nine o'clock high!

PHIL (V.O.)
Ten o'clock high!

EUGENE
Three o'clock high!

Jack OPENS FIRE. So does Eugene. The room throbs from
the vibration of the GUNS. SHELLS SPIT out onto the
floor.

INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny FIRES out of his little opening in the roof. He
can't see much, just a piece of bright sky.

INT. COCKPIT

Right behind the cockpit, Virge is FIRING his twin .50
calibers. The sound is deafening. Luke twists anxiously
in his seat, trying to see what's happening.

DENNIS
Luke, do your job. The gunners
will do theirs.

EUGENE (V.O.)
Breaking low to five o'clock!
Ball turret, look out!

INT. BALL TURRET

Rascal spins the turret and FIRES at a fighter zipping
by at an incredible speed.

RASCAL
That guy had blue eyes.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

There are planes all over the sky. It's hard to tell who
is who. Tracers streak the air. B—l7s FIRE back. It's
chaotic. The fighters are dazzling, flying rings around
the bigger planes.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Keep calling them out!

EUGENE (V.O.)
They're leaving us alone.

VIRGE (V.O.)
They're going after the first
flight.

INT. COCKPIT
Fighters are converging on the three planes above, really
giving them hell. Engine two of the lead plane bursts

into flame.

LUKE
Windy City's on fire!

INT. NOSE

THROUGH the nose we can see the German fighters soaring
off into the sky, fleeing from the burning plane.

PHIL
Why aren't they doing something?
Are they asleep?

VAL
Bail out, you guys!

PHIL
Come on, get out of there!

VAL
Jesus, there's a hole in the
pilot's window!

Suddenly, WINDY CITY EXPLODES in a huge ball of flame.

INT. COCKPIT

The ball of flame becomes a massive black cloud straight
ahead.

LUKE
Watch out!

DENNIS
Hold on, everyone!

Luke braces himself. Dennis grips the control column as
we fly straight into the huge black cloud.

INT. WAIST

The room is filled with smoke, getting in Jack and
Eugene's eyes. Eugene cries out.

skin.

RASCAL
Ball turret! Get us out of here!

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis is gripping the wheel, trying to control the plane
as it's buffeted around in the black cloud.

DANNY (V.O.)
Radio operator.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Top turret.

There is a LOUD THUNK and the plane rocks.

DENNIS
Keep calling in!

Suddenly, we come out of the black cloud into sunshine
that seems twice as bright as before.

LUKE
Copilot.
VAL (V.O.)
Bombardier.
Beat.
DENNIS
Navigator, call in! Navigator!
INT. NOSE

Phil is paralyzed, staring at the nose. It's covered in
blood and the blood is streaming back from the tip in
rivulets and freezing. Val hasn't seen it yet.

VAL

Phil! Phil!
PHIL

Navigator. Sorry. I'm fine.
DENNIS (V.O.)

When I say call in, I mean right

Val shakes his head in annoyance of Phil, then turns
around and sees the blood.

VAL
Fuck! Somebody's guts are all
over the nose!

DENNIS (V.O.)
Any damage? Crew, check your
stations.

The blood has frozen in a ring around the nose. It
glints in the sun, horrible, but also weirdly pretty.
Phil can't take his eyes off it.

VAL
Nose okay.

DANNY (V.O.)
Radio room okay.

JACK (V.O.)
Waist okay.

CLAY (V.O.)
Tail okay.

Phil shakes himself out of his trance and turns back to
his gun.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Call out those bandits.

INT. TOP TURRET

Virge spins his turret, checking the sky. It's peaceful,
as if nothing had happened.

VIRGE
They're gone.

CLAY (V.O.)
Hit and run.

INT. COCKPIT

Ahead, C Cup and Mama's Boys draw closer together.
Friendly fighters patrol the sky in the b.g.

VAL (V.O.)
Got it.

Pause, then Dennis looks at Luke.

DENNIS
Any chutes from Windy City?

169 INT. WAIST

Eugene and Jack's faces are smudged with soot. Eugene's
eyes are watering and he rubs them.

JACK
Those guys didn't have time to pee
their pants.

CLAY (V.O.)
If you gotta go, that's the way.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Here one minute, gone the next.

PHIL (V.O.)
Do we have to talk about it?

170 INT. BALL TURRET — RASCAL'S FACE

is also greasy from the soot and he wipes it with his
scarf.

Hey, I heard a good one from the

Not so tall.

RASCAL

Everyone's tall to me.

INT. NOSE

Phil extends the penciled line across the North Sea and
above a string of islands skirting the northern coast of
Holland, the Frisian Islands. We're approaching Germany
fast. Again, Phil's hand shakes and his line isn't as
straight as it should be.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Lindquist.

RASCAL (V.O.)
No, no, no.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Something like that.

RASCAL (V.O.)
Virge, you're not even close.

We DISSOLVE FROM the map TO ——

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The real coastline, matching the map perfectly: the
curve of Holland's coastline and the Frisian Islands.

RASCAL (V.O.)
Anyway... a plane gets shot down.
This guy bails out. The Gestapo

they have to amputate...

INT. BALL TURRET — RASCAL

turns slowly in the turret, searching the sky below for
fighters as he speaks.

RASCAL
He says, 'Do me a favor. After
you cut it off, give it to one of
your pilots and have him drop it
over my base in England.‘ So they
do it.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Rascal, don't tie up the intercom.

RASCAL
This is real quick.

INT. TOP TURRET — VIRGE

slowly revolves in the top turret, carefully watching the
sky, listening.

RASCAL (V.O.)
A week later they have to take off
the guy's other leg. Same thing.
'Could you have someone drop it
over my base in England?‘ And
they do it.

INT. RADIO ROOM — DANNY

notices that his camera has moved to the edge of his desk
and is about to fall off. He grabs it just in time and
pushes it to safety.

RASCAL (V.O.)

Next week, they've got to cut off
his arm. He asks them again,
'Could you please have someone
drop it over my base in England?‘
This time they say,

(German accent)
'Nein. Zis ve can't do anymore.‘

INT. BALL TURRET — RASCAL
sits a little forward to deliver the punchline.

RASCAL
The guy says, 'Why not?‘ And they
say,

'Ve sink you're trying to escape!‘

177 INT. COCKPIT

The sound of LAUGHTER from all over the plane. Luke is
now flying the plane. Dennis is having more soup.

LUKE
Pretty good, Rascal. I think even
Dennis liked that one.

EUGENE (V.O.)
Stoller! That's his name.

JACK (V.O.)
No... no...

VIRGE (V.O.)
Stoller wasn't on Windy City.

EUGENE (V.O.)
You sure?

JACK (V.O.)
Wait, it'll come to me.

CLAY (V.O.)
I can see the guy's face.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Me, too.

A long, bleak pause as they think about it. Then Rascal
breaks the silence.
RASCAL (V.O.)
Well, whatever his name was, it's
a good joke.

DENNIS
Okay, men, let's stop fooling
around. The Gerries are out there.
Let's look sharp.

In the b.g., the Thunderbolts peel off from the formation.

LUKE
Damn, are the little friends
leaving already?

The office is scrupulously neat, the desk clean and clear.
There's the loud TICKING of a CLOCK. It's unnaturally
quiet —— none of the usual hustle and bustle of the base.
The CO is sitting at his desk, sharpening pencils. The
pencils are already as sharp as can be, but he continues
to sharpen them, one after another. Suddenly, a RAP on
the door and the S—2 enters.

S—2
Sir, you'd better come take a

INT. MESS HALL

Preparations are underway for a party. A banner is being
hung from the ceiling: "CONGRATULATIONS MEMPHIS BELLE!
25 MISSIONS!" A stage is being set up, tables are being
arranged, streamers are being strung. Bruce is arranging
it all. The CO comes up to him.

CO
What's the meaning of this?

A couple of men are rolling in a piano.

BRUCE
On the stage. Thanks. Just a
little party, Colonel.

CO
I didn't order this.

BRUCE
Leave this stuff to me. The

CO
And my job is to approve
everything on this base. I did
not authorize a homecoming...

BRUCE
Craig, you work too hard at being
a hardass. What's the harm in a
little party in honor of these
guys? They're special.

CO
I have twenty—four crews up there.
They're all special to me.

BRUCE
That's great story, but bullshit's
my business and I know it when
I see it. All you care about is
putting planes in the air.

The CO interrupts, grabbing Bruce's arm.

The CO comes in, Bruce behind him. The CO is trembling
with anger. He shouts at Bruce.

CO
Start reading. This one's from
the mother of a boy who got his
head blown off over Lorient.
Start with that.

BRUCE
Craig, I think you're cracking up.

CO
Read it!

The CO gives him the letter. Bruce starts to read it.
OVER, we hear the letter read by the voice of a FATHER.
Bruce reads it casually at first, then little by little
it gets to him, moves him. The CO puts another pile of
letters on the desk, then another. They start to spill
over onto the floor.

FATHER (V.O.)
Dear Colonel Harriman, I want to
thank you for your letter of
sympathy about my son Tommy. He
was only at your base a month,
but he must have made a big
impression because you described
him right down to his boots. I
wish you could have told me how
Tommy died, but I understand we
have to be careful about security
these days. I'm glad he was brave
and did his job to the end. Maybe
his mother and I raised him right
after all. I guess we'll get
used to him being gone, but not
too soon, I hope. Well, I can
always read your letter and that
will bring him back. Sincerely,
Thomas R. Maguire.

During the reading we ——

Danny, behind his gun, worried, tense, looking up into
his piece of sky for enemy aircraft. Then we ——

CUT TO:
EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

Outside of the plane. The Memphis Belle and its two
wingmen. Then, as more and more VOICES spill on top of
the others the way the letters spilled on top of the
CO's desk. We CUT WIDER AND WIDER until the SCREEN is
FILLED with the entire formation and the SOUNDTRACK is
filled with the VOICES READING their LETTERS to the
Commanding Officer, conveying the enormity of the air
war —— each plane contains ten young, fragile lives,
heading into battle.

Abruptly, the SEQUENCE ENDS with ——
CUT TO:
GERMAN FIGHTERS

shoot through the formation like a swarm of angry bees.
There are ME—109s and also FW—l90s. These are fatter

That's the way. That's the...

He OPENS FIRE at the fighter coming in from the rear of
the plane. As Jack swings his gun to the right to follow
it, the wind catches the sign on his back and it flaps

up into his face.

JACK
What the fuck? I had him! He
was right there! Goddamit!

He rips the sign off his shoulder and reads it. He can't
believe it. He turns to Eugene, who is FIRING out his
side and hasn't seen this. Jack's about to grab Eugene
when Rascal's voice interrupts him.

mask back on, gives Jack a kick in the butt, grabs his
gun, sights in a fighter and starts FIRING.

Val and Phil look down through the nose at the falling
man.

PHIL
Jesus, he doesn't have a parachute.
How long would it take to fall?

VAL
Too long.

Somehow, C Cup remains above. But the nose is gone and
wires and equipment dangle from it.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Everybody, make sure you've got
your parachutes.

Phil reaches under his desk for his parachute.

Rascal spins in the turret, looking for fighters.

INT. COCKPIT

C Cup is losing speed and altitude. We start to pass
it. It looks like a ghost ship. Dennis has again taken
control of the plane.

DENNIS
Okay, Danny. Give me C channel
to talk to group.

LUKE
Poor bastards.

VIRGE (V.O.)
They're dead meat.

CLAY (V.O.)
The bogeyman will get them.

EUGENE (V.O.)
Bye—bye, C Cup.

There is a sharp CRACKLE on the INTERCOM.

DANNY (V.O.)
Sir, you're on to group.

DENNIS
This is the Memphis Belle.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The Belle is now the lead plane, leading the entire
group.

Dennis is sobered by the responsibility of what he has
to do. He speaks quietly, with humility, to the other
captains.

DENNIS (V.O.)
We're lead plane now. I'll try
my best to put those bombs right
in the pickle barrel and get us
out of here safe. I'm going to
need all the help you can give me.
Let's tighten up out there and be
on our toes. We're three minutes,
thirty seconds from the bomb run.

INT. NOSE
Val FIRES at a fighter coming in a little to the right.
VAL
Bloodsucker, nine o'clock level!

Ball turret, watch out!

Rascal starts to spin the turret around, but suddenly
it sticks and won't move.

RASCAL
I'm jammed! He's coming right
at me! Virge, help!
He stomps on the control pedal, but nothing happens.
INT. TOP TURRET

Virge pulls off his oxygen mask, yanks out his intercom
cords and jumps down from the turret.

INT. BOMB BAY
Virge runs down the narrow catwalk through the bomb bay.
INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny is SHOOTING his GUN into the sky as Virge runs
past him and through the aft bulkhead doorway.

INT. BALL TURRET

Rascal stomps on the pedal again and again. Suddenly
the turret unsticks, whirls around and Rascal FIRES.

INT. BALL TURRET AREA

Virge drops to his knees beside the turret, breathing
hard. He looks at the top of the turret —— it's turning
smoothly.

VIRGE
What's his problem?

Virge shakes his head in annoyance, then starts back
towards the front of the plane.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

A FIGHTER appears out of nowhere, BUZZING down on the
left, MACHINE GUNS BLASTING.

INT. WAIST

BULLETS RIP through the waist and Jack is knocked to
the floor. His oxygen mask is ripped from his face.

EUGENE
Jack's hit!

INT. NOSE

Val is doing some adjustments to his instrument panel.
Phil is FIRING out his side of the plane.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Val, run back and look at Jack.
VAL
Captain, I'm two minutes from the
bomb run!
DENNIS (V.O.)

Okay. Gene, you're going to have
to take care of him.

Val is very relieved.

INT. WAIST

Eugene kneels beside Jack, who is squirming and yelling.
Eugene tears open Jack's pant leg around the wound on
his left thigh. Eugene pulls off his oxygen mask to
talk.

EUGENE
Jack, hold still! Let me look!

Blood is already freezing around the wound. Eugene
examines it. Then he starts to laugh.

JACK
Would you help?

EUGENE
It's a scratch! Look! It's
nothing, and you're screaming like
a stuck pig!

Jack looks at his leg. Eugene's right, it's nothing.
Then Jack sees his harmonica sticking out from his torn
pant leg pocket. It's bent —— clearly it deflected the
bullet.

JACK
My harmonica! Goddamnit, my
favorite harmonica!

Laughing, Eugene quickly wraps his flight scarf around

Jack's leg, ties it, then pulls Jack to his feet. Then
Jack reaches behind Eugene's ear and pulls out the St.

Anthony medal. Eugene looks at it, astonished.

EUGENE
How'd you do that?

Jack smiles, sheepishly.

JACK
Magic.

Eugene takes the medal and beams at Jack.
EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE
The fighters have disappeared. Everything is peaceful.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Keep calling 'em out.

VIRGE (V.O.)
They're gone.

RASCAL (V.O.)
Christ, you know what that means.

CLAY (V.O.)
Flak, nine o'clock level!

(CONTINUED)

211 CONTINUED:

RASCAL (V.O.)
That's what I was afraid of.

Black PUFFS start to blossom in the sky around the
planes. They make a soft POOF as they EXPLODE. A red
flame can be seen for a brief second in the center of
each explosion. No sooner does the smoke start to dis—
sipate than fresh puffs appear.

LUKE (V.O.)
They've got something like 500
flak batteries around Bremen.

VIRGE (V.O.)
I could live without knowing that,
Lieutenant.

211A INT. TAIL

Clay is writing in the frost that has collected on the
inside of his left window.

JACK (V.O.)
Clay, what're the odds of us
getting out of here alive?

CLAY
I was just figuring that out.

He writes "Three to One."
212 INT. BALL TURRET

A black PUFF EXPLODES not far from the turret and there's
a SHARP BANG on the side of the turret. Rascal jumps.

RASCAL
Jesus!

DENNIS (V.O.)
Ball turret, what's wrong?

RASCAL
A big piece of ass fucking Nazi
flak just hit my turret!

DENNIS (V.O.)
Are you okay?

RASCAL
I guess.

You guess or you are?

One of the little windows on the side of the turret has
been knocked out. A frigid wind blows in. Rascal tries
to plug it up with his flight scarf.

INT. COCKPIT
The constant PATTERING CONTINUES, like metal rain.

DENNIS
I hope we're all wearing our flak
jackets.

INT. WAIST

Eugene and Jack grab their heavy, bib—like flak jackets
from the floor and struggle into them.

INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny is putting on his flak jacket when the Rookie's
voice comes OVER the RADIO. Danny glances out his right
window at Mother and Country.

ROOKIE (V.O.)
(nervously)
Danny, quick question. This flak,
it's not like I expected. Can't
the captain do something, avoid it
or something?

DANNY
Not this close to the bomb run.
You have to fly straight through
or you'll be off target. It's
just four minutes.

ROOKIE (V.O.)
(nervous laugh)
Just.

Suddenly, a BANG and a hole opens in the left wall of the
radio room and a small, SIZZLING piece of FLAK skates
across Danny's desk, digs a scar in the wood and lands

on top of his log book. It burns a little hole in the
top page. Danny brushes the jagged, black piece of
shrapnel away.

INT. COCKPIT

We're flying through a massive flak barrage. Constant
PINGING and RATTLING on the outside of the plane. It's
incessant, unnerving.

PHIL (V.O.)
This is the bomb run. We're

Dennis puts his finger on the automatic pilot switch.
It's on the control box below the throttles.

DENNIS
Bombardier, I'm turning on the
auto pilot. You're flying the
plane from here to delivery.

He flips the switch. Lights flicker on the instrument
panel.

INT. NOSE

Val is bent over the bombsight, making careful adjust—
ments. He works with great concentration, ignoring the
flak barrage that can be seen directly ahead through the
nose.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Seventy thousand pounds of bombs
are going to drop on your command.
I want pinpoint bombing.

VAL
Yes, sir.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Pinpoint.

INT. COCKPIT

Black smoke is smeared all over the sky. Puffs appear
constantly. The RATTLING on the outside of the plane has
grown LOUDER. It doesn't give you a moment's peace.

LUKE
Christ, I've never seen it this
thick before.

Suddenly, a LOUD BANG and blood sprays all over the cock—
pit. The instrument panel, windshield, Dennis and Luke
are drenched.

VIRGE (V.O.)
What was that?

DENNIS
Luke's hit!

(CONTINUED)

218

92.

CONTINUED:

LUKE
Dennis is hit!

Virge rips off his oxygen mask and jumps down from the
top turret to look at them.

VIRGE
Jesus!

Dennis and Luke examine themselves: Dennis rationally,
Luke in a panic.

DENNIS
It's not me. It must be you.
LUKE
It isn't me!
DENNIS
(to Virge)

I think he's in shock.

LUKE
I'm not in shock! You're in shock!

VIRGE
Val, you better get up here fast.

VAL (V.O.)
I'm on the fucking bomb run!

Virge sees something on the floor and reaches for it.

DENNIS
It's not me.

LUKE
Me, either!

DENNIS

It's got to be somebody. There's
blood all over the cockpit.

Virge picks up Dennis's Thermos off the floor, cut in two.

VIRGE
Tomato soup.

He starts to laugh. It takes Luke a moment to get over
his terror, but then he starts laughing, too. Dennis is
relieved. Then, suddenly, an incredible BANG and the
plane rocks violently.

DENNIS
What was that?

RASCAL (V.O.)
There's a hole as big as my dick
in the left wing!
EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The hole is about two feet in diameter. It's between
engines one and two. Gas is leaking.

INT. COCKPIT

The needle on one of the fuel gauges is sinking.

LUKE
We're losing fuel!
DENNIS
Virge, get on the fuel transfer

pump.

Virge turns around, bends down and flicks the transfer
levers.

LUKE
Hurry!

VIRGE
The electrics must be out on the
left side. The pumps aren't
responding. I'll do it by hand.

DENNIS
Luke, work with him. We've got to
save as much fuel as we can.

Virge runs into the bomb bay.

VAL (V.O.)
Two minutes to target.
CLAY (V.O.)
Let's drop those bombs and get out

of here!

Val pulls a lever on his control panel on the left side
of the fuselage.

Bomb bay doors open.

INT. BOMB BAY

Virge is standing on the narrow catwalk at the front end
of the bomb bay, working the fuel transport pump switches
when the bomb bay doors start to open. He looks down at
the ground, so far below. Suddenly, a flak SHELL BURSTS
right below the bomb bay. There's a frantic CLICKING as
pieces of SHRAPNEL HIT the bombs. Virge looks through
the bomb bay into the radio room and meets Danny's eyes.

INT. NOSE

Val takes his eye from the bombsight and looks out the
nose. Although the day is perfectly clear, the ground
ahead is covered with low—lying white smoke.

VAL
Bombardier to Captain. The
target's covered. Looks like a
smoke screen.

Val flips down the safety latch on the bomb release
button. It's on the left side, next to the bomb bay
door control.

INT. COCKPIT
Virge comes out of the bomb bay.

VIRGE
Fuel transport complete. We saved
some of it.

DENNIS
Bombardier, how's that target?

POV THROUGH BOMBSIGHT — TARGET

Houses, a river and the beginning of the smoke screen.
There are two crosshairs which Val manipulates with
course knobs on either side of the bombsight.

VAL (O.S.)
Target totally obscured.

INT. NOSE

Val flips some switches and sets a couple of dials on the
control panel. He does this with quick precision, then
looks through the sight again.

VAL
Thirty seconds to delivery.

INT. COCKPIT

Flak is still pummeling the outside of the plane. Black
smoke is smeared all over the sky. The plane wobbles.

DENNIS
Bombardier, I need those bombs on
target. The whole group is bombing
with us.

VAL (V.O.)
If I can't see, I can't see.

Dennis reaches down and puts his hand on the auto pilot.
Luke looks at him in shock.

LUKE
What do you think you're doing?

DENNIS
We came here to bomb a factory.
We're going to bomb a factory even
if it means going around again.

LUKE
Are you crazy? You go around on a
bomb run, that's like sending out
an engraved invitation to the Nazis
to blow us away!

DENNIS
Luke, I'm in command!

INT. NOSE
Val puts his finger on the bomb release button.

VAL
Dennis, what do you want me to do?

ON PHIL

At his desk, watching Val, terrified.

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis has taken his finger off the auto pilot switch.

DENNIS

Dennis flips the auto pilot to "off."

DENNIS
We're going around again.
LUKE
Fuck!
DENNIS

Danny, give me C channel again.
INT. NOSE

Val takes his finger off the bomb release button and
adjusts the bombsight. Phil lunges for the button. Val
sees him out of the corner of his eye and grabs Phil's
hand just before he can push it. He shoves Phil back,
then snaps the safety catch back on the button. Phil
sits in his chair, shaking.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The Belle banks into a sharp turn to the left. Baby
Ruth and Mother and Country follow.

DENNIS (V.O.)
It'll take us five minutes to get
back to the start of the bomb
run. Navigator, give me a
postition.

INT. NOSE

Phil is sitting at his table, but unable to work, to
focus.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Navigator, did you hear me?

Phil looks up and meets Val's gaze. They look at each
other a long moment. Then Phil turns back to his maps.

PHIL
Yes, sir.

He tries to pull himself together and begin to work.

97.
255 INT. COCKPIT

Dennis banks out of the turn and straightens out the
plane.

DENNIS
Everybody listen. I know you want
to drop the bombs and get the hell
out of here. But there's civilians
down there, there's a school right
next door and if we don't get
these bombs right in the pickle
barrel, a lot of innocent people
are going to be killed.

LUKE
They're all Nazis, what
difference...?

DENNIS
Luke, shut up!

Luke glares at him.
254 INT. WAIST

Jack and Eugene are both listening. Eugene clutches his
St. Anthony medal, the broken chain dangling.

DENNIS (V.O.)
I don't want to go around again
any more than you do. But we were
sent here to bomb a factory and if
we don't do it, somebody's going
to have to come back here again
and do it for us.

255 INT. BALL TURRET

FLAK is BURSTING right outside Rascal's turret and
PATTERING against it. He's shivering from the cold
blowing in the broken window.

DENNIS (V.O.)
Nobody promised us it would be
fun and games. It's our job.
Ours, nobody else's.

With a swipe, he wipes them away. All bets are off now.

INT. COCKPIT
Luke has not taken his eyes off Dennis.

DENNIS
Now, let's get back to work, stay
alert and call out those fighters
soon as you see them.

Silence. The flak has stopped. Dennis feels Luke's
stare and looks over at him. They exchange a long, long
look, then Dennis breaks it. Suddenly, Virge calls out.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Bandits, three o'clock high!

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The plane has straightened and Baby Ruth and Mother and
Country have closed in tight beside it. A squadron of
fighters appears high in the sky, queued up, ready to
come in. They dive down at the formation, one after
another.

EUGENE (V.O.)
Ten o'clock, too!

JACK (V.O.)
Two of them, coming in at eight.

RASCAL (V.O.)
I don't like being in the lead.

CLAY (V.O.)

Yep, we're the piece of shit the
flies are headin' for.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Here they come, here they come!

Rascal spins the turret and starts FIRING.

INT. WAIST

Both Eugene and Jack open up, FIRING out of their sides
of the plane.

INT. COCKPIT

GUNS are FIRING all over the plane. Virge's GUN throbs
right behind the cockpit. Luke is jumpy.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Bandit, twelve o'clock high!
Cockpit, look out, he's heading
straight for you!

Luke looks up in terror at the fighter zooming in at
him, FIRING away.

LUKE
What am I supposed to do, spit at
him?

Luke ducks his head down, as the FIGHTER BUZZES right at
them. Dennis doesn't even glance up. The fighter passes
overhead. Luke comes up from his tuck. He's jumping out
of his skin.

LUKE
Tail gunner, how are you doing
back there?

CLAY (V.O.)
Jus' fine, Lieutenant.

LUKE
Let me know if you need help.

INT. TAIL

Clay calmly FIRES at a fighter barrel—rolling under the
Belle. It's already on fire.

CLAY
Sure will. But I'm doin' just...

He hesitates. He remembers. Then, a little too
obviously:

CLAY
Oh, right, Lieutenant! I do
need some help back here!

INT. COCKPIT

Luke pulls off his oxygen mask, yanks out his intercom
cord and starts to get up.

DENNIS
Tail gunner, what's wrong?

CLAY (V.O.)
I'm runnin' out of ammo.

LUKE
I'll take care of it.

DENNIS
Can't somebody else do it? Right
waist, left waist?

JACK (V.O.)
Captain, we got fighters all over
us back here.

LUKE
Dennis, I'm the only one not
doing anything.

DENNIS
(a beat; then)
Okay, but make it fast.

Luke steps over the control box, squeezes past Virge

and heads into the bomb bay.

INT. RADIO ROOM

Luke goes past Danny, who's FIRING up into the sky, then

through the aft bulkhead doorway. From here we see Luke
go the length of the plane to the tail.

INT. NOSE

Val is bent over the bombsight, making adjustments,
turning dials. Phil takes off his mask to talk. So

Val refastens his mask and turns back to the bombsight.
Phil turns back to his maps.

INT. TAIL

Luke comes into the tail and changes places with Clay.
He kneels in front of the guns with Clay behind him,
watching over his shoulder.

JACK (V.O.)
190 breaking to ten o'clock.

VIRGE (V.O.)
Another one, high at three. Radio
operator, hear me?

DANNY (V.O.)
Gotcha. Thanks, Virge.

Luke looks around for fighters, but none are in sight.

LUKE
Come on, come on...

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

A speck appears way down below, dodging through the
formation at a fantastic speed. Fortresses FIRE at it,
but it keeps coming.

RASCAL (V.O.)
Tail gunner, see that bandit at
seven low? He's all yours, Clay.

INT. TAIL
Luke eagerly aims his guns down at the approaching plane.
EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The fighter keeps coming. It flips over on its back and
zooms toward the Belle's tail, MACHINE GUNS BLASTING.

INT. TAIL

Luke OPENS FIRE. He follows the fighter up past the
tail. At first it looks like Luke missed it. Then the
FIGHTER STALLS, stopping dead in the air above. Smoke
starts streaming from its belly, its nose drops down and
it starts a slow fall to the right.

LUKE
I got him! I got him! Whooo!

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The fighter falls right into Mother and Country. The
fighter's left wing slices off the B—l7's tail.

INT. TAIL
Luke watches with horror.

LUKE
No!

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

Mother and Country's tail section tumbles toward the
ground with the fighter.

RASCAL (V.O.)
It's the rookies! They got the
rookies!

INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny looks out the right side window, alarmed. Then he
flips a switch on his radio.

DANNY
Memphis Belle to Mother and
Country! Come in, come in!

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE
The back of Mother and Country drops down and two men

roll out. For a moment, Mother and Country hangs in the
air like a big cross. Then it plunges toward the ground.

SCREAMING, complete chaos. Danny listens with horror.

INT. TAIL

Luke watches, horrified, as Mother and Country falls.
He's stunned, paralyzed by what he did.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

Mother and Country plummets to the ground, spinning as
it goes, like a giant arrow. Then it hits the ground
with a quick flash and a little plume of smoke. When it
hits, the RADIO GOES DEAD. Silence.

INT. RADIO ROOM

Danny sits there a moment, shocked by the suddenness of
it. Then he starts to move to his position behind his
gun.

INT. TAIL

Clay grabs Luke by the back of his jacket and pulls him

up and shoves him out of the way. Then Clay falls to his
knees before his GUNS and STARTS FIRING.

DENNIS (V.O.)
How many chutes from Mother and
Country?

EUGENE (V.O.)
I saw two.

RASCAL (V.O.)

Yeah, two.

CUT TO:

CLAY'S WHITTLED MODEL PLANE

sitting in a sea of spent cartridges. It's crushed. In
the b.g. we see Luke's back as he starts slowly toward
the front of the plane.

INT. TAIL WHEEL

As soon as he's out of the tail and into the tail wheel
area, Luke stops and leans against the fuselage wall.
Tears come to his eyes. He tries to hold them back, but
can't. He's overcome with remorse for what he has done.
He finally realizes the horror of war. He struggles to
pull himself together. Then he starts towards the
cockpit.

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis is alone in the cockpit. PHIL'S VOICE comes over
the INTERCOM.

PHIL (V.O.)
Captain, this is the bomb run.

DENNIS
Bombardier, I'm turning it over
to you.

VAL (V.O.)
Roger.

Dennis flips the auto pilot switch to "On." Dazed, Luke
squeezes past the top turret, climbs into the cockpit and
sits in his seat. Dennis pulls off his oxygen mask to
talk.

DENNIS
Luke, right after delivery, on our
way to the rally point, I'm going
to take some evasive action and
try to avoid this flak. Be ready
on rudder.

LUKE
Whatever you say, Dennis. You
know what you're doing.

Dennis looks at him, astonished by this response. Luke
turns away to hide his face.

POV THROUGH BOMBSIGHT — TARGET

The ground is almost visible, still covered with smoke.
A patch of green or a piece of river can be seen for an
instant, but that's all.

near the button. Phil looks at Val a moment, then turns
back to watch for fighters. Val looks through the bomb—
sight again.

VAL
Captain, I still can't see a thing.

INT. COCKPIT — DENNIS
his finger hovers over the auto pilot switch.

EUGENE
Bandit, three o'clock high. Top
turret, see him?

VIRGE (V.O.)
I see him. He's a dead man.

JACK
Ball turret, watch this guy on the

RASCAL (V.O.)
He ain't going to get it.

something. What do you want me
to do?

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis's finger is on the auto pilot switch. His hand
trembles.

FIRES his GUN with one hand and rubs his lucky horseshoe
with the other.

kisses his St. Anthony medal as he FIRES at a FIGHTER
BUZZING in on the right.

finishes firing off a round, then reaches inside his cuff
for his lucky rubber band, but it isn't there. A flash
of panic. Then he remembers he loaned it to Eugene. He
looks through the rear bulkhead door and can see Eugene.
Danny's relieved his rubber band isn't far away.

INT. NOSE — VAL

INT. NOSE — VAL
jerks his head up from the bombsight and shouts, excited.

VAL
That's it! That's it! Bombs away!
(presses the bomb
release button)
Right in the pickle barrel!

INT. BOMB BAY
Bombs start dropping from the racks.
EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The bombs fall from the bottom of the Belle. Bombs also
start to fall from Baby Ruth and the other planes in the
group. Bombs are dropping all over the sky. Then they
hit the ground. Flashes, then billowing clouds of grey—
black smoke. It's an unforgettable, frightening sight.

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis watches the delivery from his side window. Then
he reaches down and flips off the auto pilot.

DENNIS
Okay, boys, we've done our job for
Uncle Sam. Now we're flying for
ourselves.

He turns the control wheel. There are WHOOPS of joy all
over the plane —— they did it.

INT. WAIST — EUGENE AND JACK

holding on as the plane tips into its turn. Eugene holds
up his St. Anthony medal. Jack gives him the thumbs—up
sign.

INT. NOSE

Phil reaches out and pats Val on the back, but Val
angrily shakes him off.

JACK
Gerry breaking low to nine

watch it!

INT. BALL TURRET

Rascal pushes on the foot pedal to swivel the turret,
but nothing happens.

RASCAL
I'm stuck! Virge! He's coming
right at me! Virge! Virge!

The fighter is zooming in right at him, firing. Rascal
stomps on the pedal, but still nothing happens. The
fighter keeps coming, keeps firing. Rascal's eyes widen
in horror.

INT. COCKPIT
Suddenly, a HUGE EXPLOSION and the plane rocks violently.

DENNIS
Call in!

Virge pulls off his oxygen mask, yanks out his intercom
cord, jumps down from the top turret and charges into
the bomb bay.

Panicky, Virge falls to his knees beside the ball turret,
opens the hatch and looks down into it.

VIRGE'S POV

down into the turret. The bottom of the turret is gone
and Rascal is dangling twenty thousand feet above the
ground, held by just the strap between his legs. He's
holding onto the top of the turret and the force of the
slipstream is blowing his legs toward the back of the
plane. He's out of his mind with terror. He reaches
for Virge. Virge grabs his hands and pulls him, with
difficulty, out of the narrow hatch on the top of the
turret. Rascal is shot up a little. Virge quickly
checks him, but the wounds look superficial. Rascal is
shaking and crying.

VIRGE
You're okay, Rascal. You're safe.
You're okay.
Rascal grabs Virge and hangs onto him. Virge holds him,
pats his back, trying to comfort and calm him down.

INT. WAIST — EUGENE AND JACK

are FIRING frantically out of their sides of the plane.

INT. TAIL — CLAY
is FIRING, too, humming a little as he does.
INT. RADIO ROOM — DANNY

finishes FIRING a round, then swings his gun around to
fire at another fighter. As he does, he sees that his
camera has again moved to the edge of the desk and is
just about to fall. Quickly, Danny reaches for it and
catches it just as the camera falls off the edge. Relief.
Just then, a CANNON SHELL bursts through the roof of the
radio room and EXPLODES.

INT. COCKPIT
The plane is jolted harder than ever.

INT. RADIO ROOM

The room is on fire. Danny lies face—down on the floor.
Virge pulls him away from the flames while Rascal grabs
a fire extinguisher and turns it on the flames.

INT. COCKPIT

Fighters are everywhere. FLAK is still PUMMELING the
outside of the plane. Virge comes out of the bomb bay
and crouches down behind Dennis and Luke.

VIRGE
Danny's hurt.

DENNIS
Val, Danny's hurt. Get back
there right away and see what you
can do.

INT. NOSE — VAL
STOPS FIRING his GUN. He hesitates.

PHIL
I'll cover your gun. Just go!
VAL
(hesitantly)

Maybe somebody in the back of the
plane could...

PHIL
You're the fucking doctor!

VAL
(panicky)
That's just it. I'm not. Phil,
I lied about it. I only had two
weeks of medical school before I
enlisted. I don't know anything.

Phil drags him toward the back of the nose, grabs the
first aid kit off the wall and shoves it into Val's
hands.

PHIL
Just do it!

Val starts to go up the hatch to the cockpit.

INT. RADIO ROOM

The fire is out. Val, Virge and Rascal gently turn Danny
over. His oxygen mask was ripped off in the explosion.
He's pale and still. Val opens his jacket. There is an
ugly, open wound in his upper chest below his shoulder.
Val stares, paralyzed with fear. Then he opens the first
aid kit and takes out a syringe.

INT. COCKPIT
Dennis speaks quietly, comfortingly to Luke.

DENNIS
Luke, don't take the world on your
shoulders. You didn't start the
war. All we can do is try to do
our best. We're not perfect.
When this is all over, we'll go
back home...

LUKE
(looking out
window)
Fire on number three!

DENNIS
Cut fuel, feather prop. Fire
extinguisher.

Luke quickly turns the engine three feathering switch on
the instrument panel, then pulls the turbo supercharger
control and closes the throttle, both on the control box.
Suddenly, BULLETS RAKE across the instrument panel. GLASS
and sparks fly as Dennis and Luke cringe. Half the
instrument panel is shot out.

DENNIS
Call out those fighters!

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The prop on engine three slows, then stops, edges facing
into the wind. But the fire still burns and now it's
spreading to the wing itself.

VIRGE
Danny's in bad shape.

DENNIS
How's Rascal?

VIRGE
He's okay.

LUKE
Prop feathered, but the
extinguisher's not working. If
we don't do something quick we're
going to lose the wing. Dive!

DENNIS
Okay, but I'm going to need you
to pull out of it.

LUKE
I'm not going anywhere.

DENNIS
Crew, I'm going to dive and try
to blow this fire out. Everybody
hang on!

He depresses the control wheel.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE

The plane begins to plunge, leaving Baby Ruth behind.

INT. WAIST

Jack's and Eugene's feet go out from under them. They're
suddenly weightless. Eugene hangs on to his gun, but
Jack loses his grip and is slammed against the ceiling.
Shell casings fill the air.

EXT. MEMPHIS BELLE
Suddenly the flame on engine three blows out.

LUKE (V.O.)
It's out!

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis and Luke pull back hard on their control wheels.
The plane shudders violently as if it's going to rip
apart. Luke and Dennis strain to control it. They're
working together now as partners, no need for words. The
plane starts to pull out of the dive. After it levels,
Dennis pulls off his oxygen mask and takes a deep breath.

Val is just finishing injecting Danny with morphine. He
pulls out the needle. Rascal, Virge and Eugene are
gathered in the radio room. Danny is still unconscious
and his breathing is shallow. There are occasional
BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from the front and rear of the plane.

VAL
I don't know what else to do.
He's lost a lot of blood.

EUGENE
How far is it to base?

VIRGE
On three engines? Two hours,

Two and a half hours! He'll

There's one more thing we can do.

RASCAL
What? Let's do it!

VAL
We can put a parachute on him...
and push him out.

The others react with shock.

VIRGE
Jesus Christ, Val!

VAL
It's crawling with Germans down
there. He'll get picked up by
the Germans and they'll take him
to a hospital.

RASCAL
If they don't kill him for fun
first!

VAL

Rascal, it's his only chance!
Another crew did it. This gunner
lost an arm...

VIRGE
Yeah, but that guy was conscious.

EUGENE
Danny couldn't even pull the cord.

Phil looks at Val. Val avoids his glance.

VAL
We just don't have a choice,
Dennis. We've got to do it.

PHIL
No!

DENNIS
All right. Tell the men that's
my decision and I don't want any
argument.

Val starts to return to the bomb bay. Phil follows him
through the top turret and stops him on the threshold of
the bomb bay. The bomb bay doors open, revealing the
ground so far below. The enlisted men are gathered
around Danny at the other end of the bay. They have put
a parachute on him and tucked the chute under his arm.

PHIL
Please don't do it, Val.

PHIL
Val, you can save him! So, you're
not a doctor, so what? You can
help him, I know you can. Don't

give up.
VAL
Phil, I'm scared!
PHIL
No, you're not. You're not

Phil turns Val around and looks him in the eye.

PHIL
You're Val.

Val looks at him a long, long moment.

PHIL
Now go help Danny.

Val takes a breath, nods and starts toward Danny.

Danny becomes calmer. He closes his eyes. Then he starts
to shake. Val tucks Danny's jacket around him tighter,
but the convulsions only get worse. Val feels Danny's
pulse, then lifts one of his eyelids. Danny's eye is
turned up into his head.

VAL

Danny suddenly stops shaking. He lies still. Val pulls

arm affectionately, then goes inside —— back to work.

INT. WAIST

Rascal opens the waist door. The Ambulance Drivers are
there. He steps aside and they enter the plane,
carrying a stretcher, a medical kit, an IV bottle.

EXT. CONTROL TOWER — LAWN

The photographer is snapping pictures. Bruce yells at
him.

BRUCE
I don't want that Goddamn
ambulance in there!

INT. COCKPIT

Dennis and Luke quickly flip off the power and fuel
controls.

DENNIS
Wing flaps.

LUKE
Up.

DENNIS
Tail wheel.

LUKE
Unlocked.

DENNIS
Generators.

LUKE
Off.

They're finished. Silence. They don't know what to do
with themselves. Then Luke unhooks his seat belt and
gets up and goes through the top turret into the bomb
bay. But Dennis just sits there.

EXT. RUNWAY

Danny is conscious, pale, but looking better. He's
hooked up to an IV, which Val holds. The rest of the
crew is with them, under the nose of the plane. Danny
clutches his camera.

VAL
One picture, Danny, then straight
to the hospital.

DANNY
(weakly)
You're the doc.

Val smiles. Bruce starts arranging their positions while
the photographer sets up his tripod.

CONTINUED:

BRUCE
Let's have the officers in the
center. Luke, I want you down
front...

LUKE
Bruce, just take the picture.

He takes Danny's camera and tosses it to Bruce. Bruce
catches it, too surprised to object.

DANNY
Where's the captain?
PHIL
Yeah, where is Dennis?
RASCAL
We've got to have Dennis in the

picture.

Dennis appears around the nose of the plane. He holds the
bottle of champagne. He walks towards the crew, a grim
expression on his face. The crew shifts uneasily. Dennis
stops right in front of Danny and looks at him. Danny
thinks he's in big trouble. Then, suddenly, Dennis whoops
with joy and pops the cork. Champagne spurts out and
Dennis douses the crew with it. The crew is amazed ——
this is a new Dennis. They laugh, try to duck the suds,
and Bruce takes the picture. FREEZE FRAME. The picture
FADES TO black and white as a LEGEND ROLLS OVER it.

LEGEND
The air war over Europe lasted six
years. 555,000 young men lost

their lives.
OVER the credits we see more of the pictures Danny took:

at the dance, in the barracks, in the plane —— his
permanent record of the last mission.

FADE OUT.

THE END
