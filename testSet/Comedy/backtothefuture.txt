INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM — DAY ’I

A WEIRD FLICKERING WHITE LIGHT strobes the screen, accompanied by
PROJECTOR NOISE and an OFFSCREEN CONTROL VOICE.

CONTROL VOICE
5...4...3...2...1...detonateI

The light beoomes brighteras we pan overto

MARTY MCFLY, 17, a good looking kid wearing Porsche mirrored sunglasses. The
mirrored lenses reflect the MUSHROOM CLOUD of an ATOMIC EXPLOSION.

THE RED HOT OPENING MUSIC KICKS IN; MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
Marty starts bopping along to the rock and roll: he’s plugged into a WALKMAN STEREO.

We are in a contemporary HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM where 30-odd STUDENTS are 2
watching a 16mm documentary about nuclear tests ofthe 1950’s.

SERIES OF SHOTS — MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE 3

BORED STUDENTS watch the black and white movie. Only MARTY is enjoying himself as
he listens to his stereo. MARTY’S FOOT taps in time to the music.

The teacher, MRS. WOODS, 45, looks around the classroom, making sure the students
are paying attention. She has her “Classroom Planner“ in hand.

The DOCUMENTARY depicts preparations for another atomictest, noting that as many as
20 were done per year in the 1950’s. Footage shows how tract houses were constructed
and peopled with mannequins to measure the effects of radiation.

MARTY oontinues bopping along.

MRS. WOODS notices the one head in the classroom bobbing. MARTY’S FOOT continues
tapping in time. Now a PAIR OF WOMAN ’S SHOES step into FRAME.

MRS. WOODS is standing next to Marty, arms crossed, staring at him. But Marty is
oblivious to her.

SUZY PARKER, 17, an attractive girl, looks over at the situation in horror.
Mrs. Woods waves her hand in front of Marty’s sunglasses. No reaction.
Suzy turns her head —she can’t bearto watch.

Mrs. Woods gently removes Marty’s sunglasses. His eyes are closed.
Now Marty opens his eyes. He looks up at Mrs. Woods and smiles weakly.

Mrs. Woods does not smile back. She rips the headphones off— the MUSIC abruptly
stops.

MRS. WOODS
Mr. McFly: detention!

CUT TO:
INT. STRICKLAND’S OFFICE — DAY

CLOSE ON MARTY’S WALKMAN in a pair of ELDERLY MALE HANDS being placed in a
WOODWORKING VISE mounted on the corner of a desk.

WIDER — STRICKLAND ’S OFFICE

Marty fidgets uneasily in an uncomfortable wooden chair in the sparse office as MR.
STRICKLAND, a humorless disciplinarian, tightens the vise. Strickland looks 60, but he
could be 160 — he was born old and stayed that way, and has been at this school forever.

Strickland gazes at Marty, then gives the vise a hard, mean wrench. The Walkman
CRUNCHES... itsounds like bones breaking.

Marty cringes.
Strickland smiles sadistically and hands it backto him.

MR. STRICKLAND
That’s numberthree, isn’t it, McFly?

MARTY
Four

MR. STRICKLAND
You don’t like school, do you, McFly?

Marty rolls his eyes. Is this question for real?

MARTY
Oh, no. sir. I LOVE school.

MR. STRICKLAND
(snaps at him)
You’ve got a real attitude problem, you know that?
(opens afile on his desk)
You’re a slacker, McFly. You’ve got aptitude, but you don’t apply yourself.
You remind me of your father: He was a slacker, too.

Marty just sits there, bored.

MR. STRICKLAND
Now, for slacking off in class and for having a serious attitude problem, your
punishment is two weeks in detention, with me, starting this afternoon.

MARTY
This afternoon? But I can’t! Me and my band have an audition at 3:45 for
the YMCA dance. It’s really important that I be there — they’re counting on
me. I gotta be there at 3:45.

MR. STRICKLAND
Too bad, McFly. I guessthis isn’t your day.

Marty is sick.
CUT TO:

INT. DETENTION CLASSROOM — ON A WALL CLOCK — DAY
It’s 3:28.

WIDER

A regular math classroom used as detention after hours. Again, we see signs of an old
school dressed to be more modern: green chalkboards, repainted walls, new desks, and a
sprinkler system.

8 or 10 STUDENTS are seated far apart from each otherthroughout the room. All are
supposedly studying. One of them has a SKATEBOARD along with his books.

MARTY is at the pencil sharpener in the back, sharpening a pencil...but the look on his
face indicates he’s up to something. He looks at the clock, looks up at the SPRINKLER
PIPE, then glances toward the front of the room.

MR. STRICKLAND sits at the teacher’s desk, grading a LARGE STACK OF PAPERS.

Marty finishes at the sharpener. He sticks a PIECE OF GUM in his mouth and starts
chewing like mad. Then he steps alongside the CAROUSEL SLIDE PROJECTOR and
surreptitiously sneaks the lens into his jacket pocket. He quickly returns to his seat.

Now, Strickland stands up and starts toward Marty! Did he see Marty swipe the lens? No,
he’s merely “patrolling“ the room.

When Strickland isn’t looking, Marty produces a matchbook and a rubber band from the

pencil pouch of his loose leaf binder. He opens the matchbook cover and sticks his gum to
the backside.

He waits for Strickland to walk past him, then quickly, Marty stands and, using the rubber
band, fires the matchbook at the ceiling.

Strickland whirls around upon hearing the snap, but Martyis already seated, “studying.“
Strickland looks around suspiciously, but sees nothing. He continues along.

Marty glances up: The gum is holding the matchbook on the ceiling, right nearthe sprinkler
valve. He smiles.

Now Marty sets his mirrored sunglasses on his leg positioning them to reflectthe rays of
the sun up at the matchbook.

That done, he pulls the lens out of his pocket and focuses the beam onto the matchbook.
He adjusts the lens ever so slightly... thereI Perfect! A hot white pinpoint of light is focused
on the matchbook.

MR. STRICKLAND returnsto his paper grading. He marks an entire set of answers wrong
and puts “F“ at the top of a paper. The next paper has two right. Strickland gives it an “F+.“

MARTY continues holding the lens as steady as he can, watching anxiously for results.

ABOVE there is a faint trace of SMOKE on the matchbook.

*

THE CLOCK now reads 3:37.

STRICKLAND grades his LAST PAPER, THEN STANDS UP AND STARTS PULLING
DOWN THE WINDOW SHADES!

MARTY is horrified! Strickland is3 shades away from Marty’s window. Marty looks
anxiously up at the matchbook.

MARTY
(under his breath)
Come on, come on...!
Strickland pulls down the next shade.

There is more smoke from the matchbook...

MARTY
Burn, you sucker...!

Strickland pulls down another shade. The next one is Marty’s...
Strickland steps toward it...

Suddenly the matchbook ignites! FIRE!

Immediately the FIRE ALARM SOUNDS and the SPRINKLERS GO OFF!

MARTY
FIRE!!!

Students jump up and scream as water sprays all over them! They rush for the door.
MARTY grabs the kid with the skateboard, named WEEZE.

MARTY
Weeze — let me borrow this! I’ll bring it back tomorrow!

Marty takes the skateboard and dashes out.

MR. STRICKLAND
Stop! Wait! We must file out in an orderly fashion!

Another sprinkler goes off and sprays Strickland right in the face!
EXT. HILL VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL — DAY

It’s a classic WPA style high school, built in the 1930’s. Marty dashes out, jumps on the
skateboard, and skateboards down the front steps!

EXT. HILLY RESIDENTIAL STREET — DAY

Marty comes from around the corner, skateboards down a hill, weaving through traffic. He
skateboards like a champ.

EXT. STREET — TOWN SQUARE — DAY

10

This is HILL VALLEY, a northern California town; it’s October. The town has been here a
while — and its town square business district is beginning to deteriorate... undoubtedly
because there’s a mall someplace.

The old courthouse, nowthe Department of Social Services, has a clocktower— but the
clock is stopped at 10:02.

A time and temperature clock on the BANK reads 3:43.

MARTY skateboards down the business street and across traffic, narrowly missing being

hit by a car!

INT. YMCA — STAGE — DAY 9

3 MEMBERS ofthe PINHEADS rock band, KEYBOARDS, BASS and DRUMS, exchange
nen/ous glances, repeatedly checking their watches. They’re all set up on stage.

SUZY PARKER is also here — but she’s not part of the band. *
Suddenly, Marty skateboards onto the stage.

SUZY
Marty!

Marty gives her a wink; she smiles.

Marty’s guitar, amp and microphone have already been set up for him. He picks up the
guitar and tunes up, then looks over at Suzy.

Suzy smiles and holds up her crossed fingers. Marty grins back. Clearly, they’re “an item.“

Marty practices a riff...and he’s great. You can’t tell where the guitar ends and the man
begins. He turns and addresses the dance committee.

MARTY
All right, we’re the Pin heads, and we’re gonna rock ‘n roll!

They kick into a red hot number. Marty’s fingers dance across the strings and frets in a
complicated lead line. He’s terrific, and the band sounds great.

They get only about 25 seconds into the numberwhen a VOICE calls out.

DANCE COMMITTEEMAN
That’s enough. Thank you.

Marty and the group stop playing, exchanging bewildered glances.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN SQUARE — DAY 10
On some of the boarded up buildings are ELECTION POSTERS: “RE-ELECT MAYOR
‘GOLDIE’ WILSON: HONESTY, DECENCY, INTEGRITY" and a picture of the incumbent.
Mayor Wilson is black, about 45, with a GOLD FRONT TOOTH.

MARTY and SUZY are walking together. She carries her schoolbooks: he has the

skateboard. And he’s depressed.

SUZY
Marty, one rejection isn’t the end of the world.

MARTY
I don’t know. Maybe I’m just not cut out for music.

SUZY
But you’re good, Marty. You’re really good. And this audition tape of yours
is great... (she gives him back a CASSETTE TAPE) You’ve got to send it in
to that record company.

MARTY
But what if they hate it? What if they say, “get outta here, kid, you got no
future?“ Why should I put myself through allthat anxiety? (He sighs.) I’m
sorry. I guess I sound like some kinda schizoid neurotic.

SUZY
Well, according to my shrink, all of our emotional anxieties are a direct result
of the influence our parents had in our childhood.

MARTY
In that case, you can kiss me off right now. You’ve met my old man. You
know what a zero he is.

Suzy nods knowingly. They are walking past a TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.

SUZY
At least he’s letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. That’s a step in the
right direction.

MARTY
Hey, I’m TAKING the car tomorrow night. That way it saves him the anxiety
of making a decision.

Marty spots a tricked-out black SUPRA in the showroom.

MARTY
Hey, check out that tricked-out Supra. Now THAT’S a car. (sighs, admiring it
Iongingly)Someday, Suzy, someday...

SUZY
What about your mother? Does she know?

MARTY
Are you kidding? She thinks I’m going camping with the guys. If she found
out I was going camping with you, she’d shit.

Marty sprays some BINACA in his mouth.
SUZY

(nods knowingly)
My shrink says a lot of parents are sexually repressed.

MARTY
My mom’s not sexually repressed. How can you be repressed about
something you know absolutely nothing about?

They pause across from the former oourthouse building.

SUZY
(flirting)
She’sjust trying to keep you respectable.

MARTY
(flirting back)
She’s not doing a very goodjob, is she?

They move closer...

SUZY
Terrible...

They’re about to kiss...

CLOCK WOMAN (0.8.)
Save the Clock Tower!

Marty and Suzy turn. A middle-aged CHURCH GROUP TYPE WOMAN has a donation can
and an armful of printed FLYERS.

CLOCK WOMAN
Please make a donation to save the clock tower.

MARTY
Lady, can’t you see I’m busy here?

CLOCK WOMAN
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to repairthat clock...

She points to the stopped clock on the old courthouse building.

CLOCK WOMAN
(continuing)
We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think itshould be preserved
exactly the way it is.

MARTY
But it doesn’t tell time. What good is it?

CLOCK WOMAN
It’s part of our history. Here — it’s all in this flyer. (gives Marty one) 30
years ago, lightning struck that clock tower, and the clock hasnt run since.
We at the society feel it’s a landmark of scientific importance, attesting to
the power of the Almighty.

MARTY
All right, lady. Here’s a quarter.

11

Marty drops a quarter into her can.
She nods and moves along to bother someone else.
MARTY
(to Suzy)
Now... you were saying that my mother wasn’t doing a very good job...
They move closer again as before, about to kiss...

Suddenly, a MALE VOICE booms out over a PA.

SPEAKER VOICE (O.S.)
Marty! Marty McFly!

Marty turns.

A medium sized RV with speakers mounted on the side is idling across the street. The
vehicle is quite used. It’s towing atarped vehicle on a trailer.

Marty recognizes it, and rolls his eyes.

MARTY
Doc, I’m busy.

DRIVER
It’ll only take a minute...

MARTY

(to Suzy)

Come on, you should see what’s inside this thing.
They go over and step inside.
INT. RV — TOWN SQUARE — DAY 11

The driver is DR. EMMETT BROWN, about 65. He looks like an old hippie, with shoulder
length white hair, Hawaiian shirt, faded jeans, an Indian turquoise around his neck and
lively — almost wild — eyes. He’s full of energy, full of life, talks fast, and is immediately
likable for his eccentricities.

With him in the RV is his big DOG, “EINSTEIN."

The inside of the vehicle is full of CLOCKS — every imaginable type, a Cuckoo, a
Grandfather, even a classic “Felix the Cat with moving eyes“. All of them are in dead sync.
There is also a bank of state-of—the-art component video and audio equipment. The 25-inch
monitor is tuned to MTV. There are discarded fast food cartons, and a spilled box of sugar
coated cereal, an unmade bed, a doggie dish, and tools and electronic parts. We might
also notice a lead canister with purple radiation symbols.

MARTY
What’s up, Doc?

BROWN
One am, right, Marty? You’re gonna be there, right? Twin Pines Mall. *

MARTY
Yeah, right.

Brown takesthe “Save the Clock“ flyer out of Marty’s hand.

BROWN
Let me write it down for you so you don’t forget... (writes on the back) “Twin
Pines Mall... one am.“ Twin Pines Mall — remember when that used to be
Peabody’s farm? It was all farmland outthere. No — I guess that was
before yourtime, Marty.

He folds theflyer and sticks it in Marty’s pocket.

BROWN
(continuing)
You’re feeling all right, Marty? You’ve been getting plenty of rest?

MARTY
Yeah, but Doc, exactlywhat are we gonna do atone a.m.?

BROWN
You want me to spoil it for you? Don’t worry about it — it’ll be great.

MARTY
You’re not planning on breaking into another power plant or something...?
That was kinda risky.

BROWN
That’s the point, Marty. Risk. Risk makes life worth living. What would you
rather do, sleep?

Brown checks one of the 4watches on his arm.

BROWN
(sudden urgency)
It’s almost time — quiet!
Suzy gives Marty a bewildered look, but Marty knows what‘s about to happen...

It’s exactly 4 o’clock, and all ofthe clocks CHIME at once — dings, dongs, electronic
tones, cuckoo birds...

Brown loves it — he drinks it up like a proud father.

BROWN
I love that!
MARTY
Look, Doc, we’ve gotta go. I’ll...see you tonight.
BROWN

Yes! At one am! It could change your life.

Marty and Suzy step out of the RV.

12 EXT. STREET — TOWN SQUARE — DAY 12
Marty and Suzy watch the RV go.

SUZY
I don’t know if you should be hanging out with a guy like that after midnight.

MARTY
Doc Brown’s all right— he’sjust a little hung up on time. A couple of years
ago, he showed up at my house and hired me to sweep out this garage of
his. He pays me 50 bucks a week, gives me free beer... and gives me total
access to his record collection — he’s got this great old record collection.
(a beat)
Hard to believe he was one of the world’s greatest nuclear physicists.

Down the street, Brown’s RV waits for an ELDERLY MAN to hobble across the street.
Brown’s voice booms out over his P .A.

BROWN (v.0. P.A.)
Let’s move it, Gramps! You’re not that old!

Suzy gives Marty a look of disbelief.

MARTY
(shrugs)
Too much radiation, I guess.
(a beat, moves closerto her)
Where were we?

She smiles and moves toward him.

SUZY
I think we were right here...

Again they’re about to kiss...
A CAR HORN HONKS LOUDLY. Suzy turns away.

SUZY
That’s my Dad. See you tomorrow.

She hops into the waiting car. Marty watches it go.

MARTY
This is not my day.

14 EXT. MCFLY HOUSE — DUSK
14
A WRECKER is in the McFly driveway with a 1979 Plymouth Reliant in tow: its front end is
completely smashed, as if someone rammed it into a brick wall. The truck driver is
unhitching it.

Looking on with horror is timid GEORGE McFLY, 47, a balding, boring, uninspired man

who wears a suit he bought at Sears 4 years ago.

Next to him is BIFF TANNEN, 48, an intimidating Iout, who wears gold chains and pinky
rings, with sartorial taste to match.

MARTY skateboards up to the scene and is shocked. He listens as Biff lambasts his father.
BIFF
I can’t believe you did this, McFly. I can’t believe you loaned me your car

without telling me ithad a blind spot. I could have been killed!

GEORGE
Biff, I never noticed any blind spot before.

BIFF
It’s there, McFly. How else can you explain this?

GEORGE
Can I assume that your insurance will pay forthis?

BIFF
My insurance? It‘s your car. Your insurance should pay for it. I wanna know
who’s gonna pay for THIS! (indicates his stained suit) I spilled beer all over
it when that car hit me. Who’s gonna pay the cleaning bill?

George hesitates, then meekly pulls out his wallet.

GEORGE
Do you think 20 dollars will cover it?

Biff snatches the 20 dollar bill out of George’s hand.

BIFF
It’s a start. And hey... where’s my reports?
GEORGE
Well, I haven’t finished them yet. I figured since they weren’t due till
Monday...
BIFF

(knocks on George’s head)
Hello? Anybody home? Think, McFly, think! I’ve gotta have time to get ‘em
retyped. If I turn in my reports in your handwriting, I’ll get fired.

GEORGE
Okay, I’ll finish them tonight and run them overfirst thing in the morning.

BIFF
Not too early — I sleep in on Saturday.

(about to leave)
Oh, hey, McFly: your shoe’s untied.

GEORGE
(falling for it)
Huh?

He looks down and Biff hits him on the chin. Biff laug hs loudly.

BIFF
Don‘t be so gullible, McFly!

Biff walks over to his sparkling year old CADILLAC on the street. He spots Marty.

BIFF
Hiya, kid. How do you like my new paint job?

Marty doesn’t. He steps overto his father, outraged. He’s about to say something, but
George raises his hands and cuts him off.

GEORGE
I know what you’re going to say, son, and you’re right. You’re right. But he
happens to be my supervisor, and I’m afraid I’mjust not very good at
confrontations.

MARTY
But Jesus Christ, Dad, look at the car! Look what he did to the car!
GEORGE
I know. And I know you were counting on using it, and I’m sorry.
MARTY
Do you have any idea how important this was to me, Dad? Do you have any
idea at all?
GEORGE
(shrugs)
Well... I guess I don’t...
Biff screeches out in his Cadillac.
MARTY
Dad, did it ever occur to you to say “no?“ Tojust once try saying “no?“
GEORGE
Son, I know it’s hard for you to understand, but the fact is, I’mjust not a
fighter.
MARTY

Try it once, Dad. Just one time, say “no.“

Now the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR sticks his head out the window of the adjacent house.
He’s 40, pot-bellied, named HOWARD.

HOWARD
Hey, McFly! My kid’s selling Girl Scout cookies! I told her you’d be good for
a case.

15

Marty shakes his head. George gulps, then calls back.

GEORGE
Well... okay.

Marty shakes his head hopelessly.
CUT TO:
INT. AT THE McFLY DINNER TABLE — NIGHT

The McFly family is dining on meatloaf, Kraft macaroni and cheese, Bird’s Eye mixed
vegetables, and French’s instant mashed potatoes.

Marty’s mother, LORRAINE, 47, was once very attractive. Now she’s OVERWEIGHT, in a
rut, a victim of suburban stagnation. She has more food on her plate than anyone else, and
a glass of vodka.

GEORGE has papers in front of him instead of food: he’s doing the work Biff gave him.
He’s also glancing at the TV, which is tuned to a “Honeymooners“ rerun.

Sister LINDA, 19, is cute but wears too much eye makeup; brother DAVE, 22, wears a
MCDONALD’S UNIFORM and is wolfing down his food.

GEORGE

(to Marty)
Believe me, son, you’re better off not having the aggravation of dealing with
that YMCA dance. You’d have to worry about getting all your equipment
there, making contingency plans in case someone got sick, making sure you
got paid correctly, settling with the Musician’s union... and what if you were
so good that other people wanted to hire you? You’d have to worry about
scheduling yourjobs around school. Believe me, son, you’re better off
without those headaches.

MARTY
Thanks for the pep talk, Dad.

LORRAINE
Kids, your Uncle Joey didn’t make parole again. I think it would be nice if
you all dropped him a line.

MARTY
Uncle “Jailbird Joey‘?

DAVE
He’s your brother, Mom.

LINDA

Yeah. I think it’s a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

LORRAINE
We all make mistakes in life, children.

Damn, I’m late.

He wipes his mouth and hurries off.

LORRAINE
Please watch yourlanguage, David.

LINDA
(to Marty)
Suzy Parker called... wants you to call her back.

LORRAINE
I don’t like her, Marty. Any girl who calls up a boy is looking fortrouble. Pass
the mashed potatoes, please.

Marty passes them and Lorraine takes a big helping.

LINDA
Oh, Mother, there’s nothing wrong with calling a boy.

LORRAINE
Well, I think it’s terrible, girls chasing boys. I never chased a boy when I was
your age. I never called a boy, or asked a boy on a date, or sat in a parked
car with a boy. Because when you behave like that, boys won’t respect you,
Linda. They’ll think you’re cheap.

Linda rolls her eyes. She’s heard this a million times.

LINDA
Then how are you ever supposed to meet anybody?
LORRAINE
It’ll just happen. Like the way I metyour father.
LINDA
But that was so stupid! Grandpa hit him with his car.
LORRAINE
It was meant to be.
LINDA

I still don’t understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.

LORRAINE
What was it, George? Birdwatching?

GEORGE
(absorbed in his work)
Huh? Did you say something, Lorraine?

LORRAINE
(to Linda and Marty)
Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He

16

seemed so helpless... like a little lost dog. And my heartjust went out to him.

LINDA
Yeah, Mom, you’ve told us a million times: “Florence Nightingale to the
rescue.“
LORRAINE

(thoughtfully, remembering)
The next weekend, we went on our first date: the “Enchantment Under the
Sea“ school dance. I’ll neverforget it — it was the night ofthat terrible
thunderstorm. Remember, George?

GEORGE
What’s that, dear?

LORRAINE
(ignores him; to Marty and Linda)
Your father kissed me for the veryfirst time on the dance floor... and that
was when I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.

Marty and Linda exchange a look and shake their heads.

LINDA
I can’t believe Dad actually got up enough nerve to kiss you in public.

LORRAINE
Well, I may have encouraged him a little...

MARTY
I’ll bet you had to practicallyjump on his bones.

Marty gets up, finished eating.

LORRAINE
You watch your mouth, young man. And excuse yourself when you get up
from the table.

Marty is already out of the room.

MARTY (0.8.)
May I be excused?

CUT TO:

INT. MARTY’S BEDROOM — NIGHT 16

*

Marty’s walls are covered with posters of rock stars and cars — particularly Toyota Supras.
There is also a portable home synthesizer, a tape recorder, and a stack of lead sheets.
Marty sits at his desk, with an submission form that has an “R & G RECORDS“ letterhead,

an envelope, and the cassette tape Suzy Parker gave him. There’s also a picture of Suzy
there.

*

He signs the form and puts it in the envelope, along with the cassette tape. He is about to

16-A

17

seal it — then he hesitates, and ponders a moment. He stares at the envelope — it’s
addressed to the “R & G RECORDS, NEW TALENT DIVISION.“ He sighs, shakes his
head, pulls the tape outand chucks the envelope and application into the trash can.

CUT TO:

INT. MARTY’S BEDROOM — CLOCK ON MARTY’S NIGHTSTAND 16-A*
It’s almost 12:30. CAMERA PANS to pick up Marty lying asleep on the bed fully clothed. *
Now Marty’s CORDLESS PHONE beeps. Marty stirs and answers it. *

MARTY
(into phone)
Hello?
(a beat, rolls his eyes)
No, I haven’t forgotten, Doc. One a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

He hangs up and shakes his head.
CUT TO:
EXT. TWIN PINES MALL PARKING LOT — NIGHT 17*

CAMERA PANS from the lit entrance sign, depicting 2 PINE TREES with “TWIN PINES *
MALL“ in lettering below (along with a digital clock at 12:59) to pick up MARTY on his *
skateboard with another WALKMAN (it’s a different brand than the one Strickland

smashed). Marty skateboards around a corner ofthe mall and sees Brown’s RV on the

vast, sodium vapor lit parking lot. DR. BROWN is clad in a white radiation suit, hood off,

(still with his Indian turquoise around his neck)and EINSTEIN, are both next to

A SLEEK, STAINLESS STEEL DELOREAN SPORTS CAR. It’s been modified with some
wicked looking units on its rear engine, giving ita particularly dangerous feel. There are
coils along the front and rear decks.

There are also several small cases of supplies and equipment, and a piece of American
Tourister luggage around the RV.

Marty skateboards over, totally blown away by the car.

MARTY
Jeez, Doc, a DeLoreanIWhat the hell did you do to it?

BROWN
Grab the camera and start taping, Marty. I’ll explain as we go.

Brown indicates a HOME VIDEO CAMERA nearby. Marty picks it up.

MARTY
And what’s with the Devo suit?

Brown lifts open the driver’s side gullwing door.

BROWN
Come on, Einstein. Get in, boy.

18

The dog obedientlyjumps in and sits in the driver’s seat. Brown buckles him in with the
shoulder harness. The dog has a BATTERY OPERATED DIGITAL CLOCK hanging
around his neck.

Marty begins taping, handheld, cinema verite style.
BROWN
(to Marty and video camera)
All right, this is test #1. Please note that Einstein’s clock here is in precise
synchronization with my control watch.
Brown holds up a digital watch next to Einstein’s clock; indeed, the two are in dead sync.
BROWN
(to the dog)
Good luck, Einie.

Brown reaches in and starts the ignition. The DeLorean engine ROARS to life. Brown turns
on the headlights and lowers the gull wing door, sealing Einstein in.

He steps back and picks up a REMOTE CONTROL UNIT, similarto one for a radio
controlled toy car. There are buttons labeled “Accelerator“ and “Brake“, a joystick, and an
LED. digital readout labeled “Miles Per Hour.“ Brown flicks the power switch on and, using
the accelerator button and joystick for steering, sends the DeLorean down to the far, far
end of the parking lot. He turns the car around so that it’s pointing toward them, idling.
BROWN

Here we go, Marty. If my calculations are correct, when the car hits 88 miles

an hour, you’re gonna see some serious shit.
Brown takes a deep breath, then pushes the accelerator button.
The DeLorean takes off, shifting gears automatically.
The LED. speedometer passes 30.
The stainless steel vehicle zooms faster... past 40...
Marty is getting it all on tape.

Brown watches intently. The speedometer climbs past 60.

IN THE CAR, Einstein remains calmly in the driver’s seat. Gauges and instrument lights
mounted behind him begin flashing.

Brown’s finger holds the accelerator button down.
The meter passes 75.

The DeLorean keeps accelerating, approaching Marty and Brown. The coils mounted
around the car begin glowing.

EXT. MALL, DELOREAN — NIGHT 18

The speedometer hits 85... 86... 87... 88...

2O

21

The automobile is suddenly engulfed by a BLINDING WHITE GLOW— then, BLAM! It’s
gone, a TRAIL OF FIRE left in its wake.

Brown and Marty are hit by a sharp blast ofair. Marty blinks in disbelief: it’s as if the car 19
never existed. Onlythe LICENSE PLATE is left behind — avanity plate: “NO TIME.“

BROWN

(elated)
What’d I tell you? 88 miles per hour! Temporal displacement occurred at
(checks watch) exactly 1 :02 am. and zero seconds.

MARTY
(shocked)
Christ Almighty! You disintegrated Einstein!

BROWN
Calm down, Marty. I didn’t disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of
both Einstein and the car are completely intact.

MARTY
Then where the hell are they?

BROWN
The appropriate question is: WHEN the hell are they. You see, Einstein has
just become the world’s first time traveler. I sent him into the future — one
minute into the future, to be exact. And at exactly 1:03 am. and zero
seconds, we shall catch up to him... and the time machine.

MARTY
Time machine? Are you trying to tell me you built a time machine out ofa
DeLorean?

BROWN

(smiles, modestly)
The way I figured it, if you’re gonna build a time machine into a car, why not
do it with some style? Besides, the stainless steel construction made the flux
dispersal—
(his digital watch BEEPS)
Ten seconds! Roll tape — and brace yourself for a sudden displacement of
air.

Marty aims the camera right where the DeLorean disappeared. Brown grips the remote
control unit tightly and counts down.

BROWN
5...4...3...2...1...

Their hair stands up on end, charged up with static electricity...

Suddenly, a SHARP BLAST OF WIND comes up out of nowhere, along with a 20
DEAFENING SONIC BOOM — and the DELOREAN REAPPEARS right where itvanished,

still going 88 mph!

Brown hits the brake button. 21

22

23

The car wheels lock up and the DeLorean comes to a SCREECHING HALT, smoke
pouring off the body.

Brown and Marty rush overto the car. Brown approaches cautiously and reaches forthe
door handle. He touches itand recoils in pain.

MARTY
Is it hot?

BROWN
It’s cold. Damned cold.

Brown raises the driver’s side door: there sits Einstein, none the worse for wear. Brown
again compares his watch with Einstein’s.

INSERT — WATCHES 22
Einstein’s reads 1:02:10; Brown’s is 1:03:10.
BACK TO SHOT 23

BROWN
Exactly one minute difference —and still ticking!

MARTY
ls Einstein all right?

Brown unbuckles the shoulder harness, and Einstein bounds out, happy and playful. Brown
gives the dog a Milk Bone reward.

BROWN
Good boy, Einie!

(to Marty)
He’s fine. And he’s completely unaware that anything happened. As far as
he’s concerned, the trip was instantaneous. That’s why his watch is a
minute behind mine — he “skipped over“ that minute to instantly arrive at
this moment in time. Come here, let me show you how it works...

Marty is still a bit skeptical, uneasy. Brown waves him over, like a kid who wants to show
off a new toy. Marty approaches cautiously.

BROWN
First, youturn the time circuits on...

Brown flips the labeled switch. An array of indicator lights go on inside.

BROWN
(continuing)
This readout, tells you where you’re going, this one tells you where you are,
this one tells you where you were.

The three readouts are respectively labeled “DESTINATION TIME,“ “PRESENT TIME“ and
“LAST TIME DEPARTED.“

BROWN
(continuing)
You input your destination time on this keypad. Want to see the signing of
the Declaration of Independence?

He punches 7-4-1776. The “DESTINATION TIME“ readout lights up with the date.
BROWN
(continuing)
Or witness the birth of Christ?
He punches in 12-25-0.
BROWN
(continuing)

Here’s a red letter date in the history of science: March 19, 1955...

He pauses, realizing something — as if something suddenly makes sense to him.

BROWN
Yes, of course... March 19, 1955...

MARTY
What happened then?

BROWN

That was the day I invented time travel. Actually, it was night. I remember it
vividly: I got hit overthe head, and when I came to, I had a revelation — a
vision — a picture in my head. A picture of THIS...

Brown points to a particular centerpiece unit mounted inside the DeLorean.

Marty aims the video camera and gets it on tape. He continues taping as Dr. Brown
explains.

BROWN
This is what makes time travel possible: the T.F.C. — Temporal Field
Capacitor.

MARTY

Temporal Field Capacitor, huh? How’d you get beaned?

BROWN
Well, Iwas trying to— (stops short, thinking better of it) Well, it’s not
important. What is important isthat it works. It’s taken me over 30 years to
fulfill the vision of that night.

He faces the DeLorean proudly.

MARTY
Heavy duty, Doc. And it runs on, like, regular unleaded gasoline?

BROWN
Unfortunately, no. It requires something with a little more kick...

Brown indicates a container with purple radioactivity symbols on it.

MARTY
(reads the label)
Plutonium?! You mean this sucker’s nuclear?

BROWN
Electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 jigowatts of
electricity I need. The T.F.C. stores it, then discharges it all at once, like a
gigantic bolt of lightning. Oh, you’d better put on this radiation suit before I
reload. Notthat there’s any danger, but it never hurts to take precautions.

Brown hands him the YELLOW RADIATION SUIT which is nearthe RV. Marty puts the
camera down.

MARTY
Hold the phone, Doc — plutonium’s illegal. Did you rip it off?

BROWN
No, of course not. Here, let me help you with that.

Brown helps Marty get into the suit.

BROWN
Put your hood up, Marty, while I reload... and keep Einstein covered, too.

Marty and Brown both pull their hoods over their heads. Marty covers Einstein with a sheet
of the same radiation proof material.

Brown opens the container and removes a 4-inch clear cylinder with a plutonium rod within
(it’s surrounded by water), then closes the container.

Brown steps overto the rear of the DeLorean and places the plutonium cylinder into the
loading hopper. The plutonium rod drops down into the reactor, which then seals shut.

BROWN
(removes his hood)
It’s safe now. Everything is lead lined.

Marty removes his hood and releases Einstein. He picks up the video camera and starts
taping again.

BROWN
Oh — I mustn’t forget my luggage...

Brown grabs his suitcase and puts it in the trunk (it’s in the front).

BROWN
Who knows if they’ll have cotton underwear in the future? I’m allergic to all
synthetics.
Brown slams the trunk shut.
MARTY

The future? Is that where you’re going?

BROWN

That’s right. 25 years into the future. I’ve always dreamed of seeing the *
future — looking beyond my years, observing the progress of mankind. It’s *
almost like cheating death. *
(pauses, then smiles wryly) *
I’ll also be able to find out who wins the next 25 World Series. *
Suddenly, Einstein starts BARKING at something.
BROWN
What is it, Einie?
Brown turns, and reacts with horrorto an APPROACHING PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS: it’s an
ominous VAN.
BROWN
Oh, no —they found me. I don’t know how, but they found me.
MARTY
Who?
BROWN
The Libyans! *
MARTY
What Libyans? *
BROWN
The Libyans who got me the Plutonium! They wanted me to build ‘em a *
bomb — I told ‘em I would, but I lied! *
The van side door slides open and a SWARTHY CHARACTER who resembles Yasser
Arafat leans out with an AK 47 submachine gun. He OPENS FIRE.
BROWN
Run for it, Marty! I’ll draw their fire!
Brown pulls a .45 revolver from inside his radiation suit and FIRES at the van! He then
breaks for the mall, a good 500 yards away.
The terrorist van SCREECHES around sharply and gives chase. The terrorist FIRES a
machine gun blast. *

MARTY
Doc — no! Wait!

But Brown keeps running and firing — and the van closes the distance. No way can Brown
outrun it to the mall.

The Terrorist gunner screams a Libyan curse, then FIRES a burst at Brown.
The bullets rip into Brown’s chest and the scientistgoes down.

Marty stands frozen in horror, video camera still in hand.

As if hearing Marty, the van makes a U-turn: it’s coming for Marty!

Marty looks around. He’s out in the open, and has only one chance: The DeLorean.

Marty dashes for it, even as the van accelerates toward him, and dives into the still open
driver’s door.

IN THE CAR

Marty swings the door shut, then looks overthe array or switches and buttons on the
console with frightened bewilderment: how do you start this thing?

Then he spots the keys in the ignition on the steering column, just like any other car. He
turns it over and shifts into first. He floors it.

The mall parking lot is suddenly changed into an OPEN FIELD with a SCARECROW in the

Marty is speeding toward it at 88 miles an hour — he hits it! The scarecrow’s face is
hideously smashed against the windshield.

Marty continues toward a HAYSTACK! He’s completely disoriented.

EXT. FARM FIELD AND BARN — NIGHT

The DeLorean speeds right through the haystack, and then into an OPEN BARN.

We hold on the barn exterior—we hear a CRASH; hay and dust are kicked up out the
door... then a CRACK OF WOOD — and A LARGE SECTION OF THE BARN ROOF
CAVES IN!

We hold on the barn. We hear a DOG start BARKING.

out in his red flannels, carrying a lantern. Behind him is his wife, MA; their buxom 14 year
old DAUGHTER, and lively 11 year old son SHERMAN.

They approach the barn and cautiously enter through the rear doors.

INT. BARN — NIGHT 29
The Peabodys stare in open-mouthed astonishment:

The stainless steel vehicle faces them head on, headlight beams shining through the dust.

With its wheels buried in the straw and amber hazard lights blinking, it looks like a SPACE
SHIP!

The COWS in the barn don’t seem to care much, but Ma and Pa look up at the hole where
the roof caved in, then exchange an uneasy look.

MA
What is it, Pa?

PA
Looks like an airplane.. .withoutwings...

SHERMAN
Airplane? It’s a flying saucer, Pa! From outer space!

The driver’s gull wing door rises slowly... just like a hatch.

Pa motions them all back. They watch expectantly, uneasily, with expressions of curiosity
mixed with fear.

Now Marty steps out, dazed — he’s in the radiation suit, and the HOOD IS DOWN, giving
him the appearance ofan alien!

Ma SCREAMS and faints!

PA
Run, children! Run for your lives!

They all run like hell out of the barn!
Marty takes a few steps, then removes the hood.

MARTY
Hey! Hello? Where am I?

Marty looks around. The cows in the barn just chewtheir cud.

Marty shakes his head, then steps out the barn door.

EXT. BARNYARD — NIGHT 30
Marty steps out into the barnyard.

MARTY
Excuse me! Anybody here?

EXT. FARM HOUSE — NIGHT

PA busts out of the farmhouse with a double-barreled shotgun. Sherman is right behind
him, with something rolled up in his hand.

SHERMAN
Look, Pa — it’s already mutated into human form! Shoot it!

Pa raises his shotgun and FIRES!
Buckshot cracks into the barn wall behind Marty.

PA
Take that, you mutated son-of—a-bitch!

He squeezes off the second barrel!
Shot explodes in the dirt near Marty’s feet! He dashes back into the barn!

Pa breaks the gun and reloads, then moves cautiouslytoward the barn. Just as he’s about
to enter, the DELOREAN THUNDERS OUT!

Pa Peabody jumps back!

The car spins around in the barnyard, and smashes through a white picket fence
surrounding 2 NEWLY PLANTED PINE TREES IN A LINE, just like on the sign at “TWIN
PINES MALL.“ The DeLorean takes out one of the small trees, then finds the dirt access
road and ROARS AWAY.

PA
You space bastard! You killed one of my pines!

Pa FIRES both barrels at the departing vehicle, then runs overto his“pine grove.“

PA
(extremely upset)
Now I only got one.

Now he looks up and sees Ma coming out of the barn. She’s dazed, rubbing her head.

PA
Ma! Are you all right!

Sherman runs over, terrified, with a rolled up something in his hand.

SHERMAN
Pa! No! Don’t go near her! She’s a zombie! She’s got no more free will! The
spaceman took over her brain!

PA
What the hell are you talking’, boy?

SHERMAN
Read this! It’s all right here!

Sherman shows him his WEIRD SCIENCE COMIC BOOK: On the cover is a space ship
that resembles a 50’s version ofthe DeLorean. An alien is stepping out who looks
something like Marty inthe radiation suit, and he appears to have enslaved several human
females. The title of the story is “Space Zombies From Pluto.“

Pa looks at it, then glances over at his wife with trepidation.

The DeLorean pulls into frame and stops. Marty’s gull wing door opens, revealing Marty’s
shocked expression as he sees

HIS OWN HOUSE — (MATTE PAINTING) 34

BRAND NEW, freshly painted — a MODEL HOME, complete with colored pennants and
“model home“ signs... without any landscaping.

Next to it is a LARGE SIGN with an artist’s rendering of an idyllic home, nestled between
magnificent oaktrees, with a proud family of four beside their Cadillac. Below, in big block
letters: “Live in the home oftomorrow...today! Lyon Estates, scheduled completion, This
Winter.“

Beyond it is vacant land, with some of it graded for construction. There are a few
foundations and perhaps a wood frame or two... and the familiar high tension wires.

MARTY 35
is in shock. He looks at the dashboard readouts.

INSERT — DASHBOARD LED. 36

The date on the “Destinationtime“ is Saturday, 3-19-1955, 5:35 am... and that matches

Below, the “Plutonium Chamber“ light flashes “EMPTY.“

MARTY

MARTY
This is definitely not my day.

On the back ofthe newspaper is an AUTOMOBILE ADVERTISEMENT with a picture of a
“new“ 1955 Studebaker. The copy clearly says “YOU’LL BE NOTICED driving the car of
the future — the All New1955 Studebaker.“

Marty looks at the DeLorean, looks again at the ad copy, then looks at the garage door of
his house-to-be.

MARTY
Why not...?

He tries to open the garage door: it’s locked.

Then he reaches in his pocket and pulls out his KEYS. He tries one in the garage lock. It
works! Marty smiles and opens the garage door.

ANGLE ON THE OPEN GARAGE — DAY 40*
The DeLorean backs into the garage.
Marty is about to turn off the car when he hears the RADIO DJ from the car radio.
DJ
(V.O. RADIO)

And now, one of the top records of the week...

Marty turns up the volume: he wants to hearthis. “Papa Loves Mambo“ by Perry Como
starts playing. Marty can’t believe what he is hearing. He shakes his head.

MARTY
This is nota good year.

MUSIC BECOMES SCORE AND CONTINUES OVER NEXT SEQUENCE.
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MARTY’S (MODEL) HOME — MATTE SHOT — DAY 41*

MARTY walks down the street toward Hill Valley. He’s out of the radiation suit and in his
street clothes.

CUT TO:

EXT. HILL VALLEY TOWN SQUARE — DAY 42

The town square is immediately recognizable because the courthouse clock tower is now
working. In 1955, the town square is a healthy, vibrant center of commerce. The same
buildings are well kept and clean, and the street bustles with Saturday morning activity.
Marty notices

THE MOVIE THEATER is now playing “Cattle Queen of Montana“ starring Barbara
Stanwyck and Ronald Reagan.

THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP is nowa STUDEBAKER DEALERSHIP selling new 1955 *
cars.

AN APPLIANCE STORE is selling “modern“ small appliances.
A WOMAN’S STORE displays tie latest fashions.
A TRAVEL AGENCY advertises “Fabulous Vacations in Cuba.“

THE BANK has a round clock instead of the digital version of 1985. A sign in the window
promotes “Passbook Savings at 2-1/4%.“

A RECORD STORE displays the latest records and albums: Eddie Fisher, Perry Como, Pat
Boone. There is no Rock and Roll.

AN ELECTION POSTER: “Re-elect Mayor Frank ‘Red’ Thomas. Honesty, Decency,
Integrity.“ With the exception of the name and face, it’s the same as the “Goldie Wilson“
poster of 1985.

MARTY walks along tie street staring at the places and people. The people stare at him
too, particularly his green shoes.

The previously boarded up CAFE is now open for business. Marty notices a PUBLIC
TELEPHONE SIGN on the window: he’s got an idea. He enters.

INT. CAFE — DAY 43
A typical café/soda fountain of the period; 2 or 3 CUSTOMERS are at the counter.

Marty stares at the signs advertising menu items: Hamburger — 25 cents. Ham & Cheese

— 30 cents. Chocolate Sundae — 15 cents. A sign over the cigarette display says “All

Brands 20 cents.“

LOU, the counterman, spots Marty.

LOU
Lookin’ for something, kid?
MARTY
Uh, the telephone?
Lou points it out, in back: a phone booth.
MARTY 44

goes into the phone booth and flips through the directory.

Marty digs out a nickel and dials the number. It rings...and rings... and rings. No answer.
He hangs up.

MARTY
Not my day.

He rips the page out.
47 INT. CAFE 47

Marty saunters out of the phone booth and takes a seat at the counter. A NERDY
LOOKING KID is seated nearby, sipping a soda and reading a comic book.

Marty looks at Lou, indicating the address on the phone book page.

MARTY *

Can you tell me where 1640 Riverside— *

LOU *

You gonna order something, kid? *

MARTY *

Uh, yeah. Gimme a Pepsi Free. *
LOU

Kid, if you want a Pepsi, you gotta pay for it.

MARTY
No, a Pepsi Free — you know, diet soda?

Lou looks at him like he’s from another planet.

LOU
No, I don’t know.

MARTY
Uh, well, just give me something to drink that doesn’t have sugarin it.

Lou gives him a look, then puts a cup of coffee in front of him. Marty looks at the bowl of
sugar cubes in front of him.

MARTY
Have you got any Sweet ‘N Low?

LOU
Sweet and what?
(eyeing him suspiciously)
Say, kid, you’d better pay forth is right now.

MARTY
Okay.

He pulls out his wallet and gives Lou a crisp, new 20 dollar bill. Lou’s eyes nearly fall out of
his head.

LOU
A 20? What do you think this is, a bank? I can’t break a 20 for a nickel cup
of coffee. (suddenly suspicious) Say, what’s a kid your age doing with a 20
dollar bill anyway?

Marty gulps, pulls a nickel out of his pocket and takes back his 20. Lou gives him a look,
then walks away.

Marty raises his coffee cup and just as he’s about to take a sip...

VOICE (08.)
Hey, McFly!

MARTY
Huh?

He spins around on his stool.

The voice came from a PUNK, 17; behind him are 3 OTHER PUNKS. The lead punk is
coming right toward Marty... no, he’s stepping overto the NERDY KID next to him.

NERDY KID
Uh, hi, Biff, how’s it going?

Yes, the punk is BIFF TANNEN, aged 17! And the nerdy kid is GEORGE McFLY, also 17. *
Biff takes George’s soda and drinks it all. *

Biff’s boys buy cigarettes atthe counter. They are MATCH, perpetually chewing a wooden
matchstick; SKINHEAD, who has a crewcutjust this side of being bald; and 3-D, who
always wears red-green 3-D glasses.

Marty watches the exchange between Biff and George with utter amazement.

BIFF
You got my homework finished, McFly?

GEORGE
Well, no. I figured since it’s not due till Monday...

Biff knocks on George’s head.

BIFF
Hello? Anybody home? Think, McFly, think! I’ve gotta have time to reoopy it.
Do you realize what would happen if I turned in MY homework in YOUR
handwriting? I‘d get kicked out of school!
(notices Marty staring at him)
What are you lookin‘ at, dipshit?

SKINHEAD
Biff— get a load of his shoes. This dork thinks he’s a leprechaun — he
painted ‘em green!

They all laugh. Biffturns back to George.

BIFF
So how about my homework, McFly?
GEORGE
Um, okay, Biff, I’ll do it tonight and bring it over first thing tomorrow.
BIFF
Not too early — I sleep in on Sundays. Oh, hey, McFly — your shoe’s
untied.
GEORGE
(looks down, falls for it)
Huh?

Biff hits him in the chin. He laughs loudly, as do his cronies... and they leave.

Marty, still in disbelief, turns to George.

MARTY
I don’t believe it. You’re George McFly...?
GEORGE
Uh-huh.
MARTY
Your birthday’s August 18th, and your mother’s name is Sylvia?
GEORGE
Uh-huh. Who are you?
MARTY

I’m a relative of yours. Avery distant relative.

A BLACK BUSBOY has been sweeping up in the background, making his way over. He
looks at George. As he talks, we see he has a gold front tooth — it’s GOLDIE WILSON,
aged 22!

GOLDIE
Say, what do let that boy push you around for?

GEORGE
Well, uh, he’s biggerthan me...

GOLDIE

Stand tall, boy. Have some respect for yourself. You let people walk over
you now, they’ll be walkin’ over you forthe rest of your life. Look at me. You
think I’m gonna spend the rest of my life in this slophouse?

LOU
(has heard the remark)
Watch it, Goldie.

GOLDIE

(he’s on a roll)
No, sir! I’m gonna make something of myself! I’m going to night school —
I’m gonna be some body!

MARTY
That’s right — he’s gonna be Mayor someday.

This is an idea that’s never occurred to Goldie.

GOLDIE
Mayor? That’s a good idea! I could run for mayor!

George slips out as the conversation continues.

LOU
Ha! A colored mayor! That’ll be the day!

GOLDIE
You waitand see, Mr. Carruthers. I’m gonna be mayor.

LOU
Just keep sweeping, Goldie.

Now Marty notices that George has left. He goes out after him.
GOLDIE
(to himself)
“Mayor Goldie Wilson.“ I like the sound of that.
48 EXT. — HILL VALLEY TOWN SQUARE 48
Marty looks around and sees GEORGE bicycling down the street.

MARTY
George! Hey, George! Iwant to talk to you!

But George doesn’t hear him. He disappears around a corner.
Marty runs after him.

49 EXT. — A RESIDENTIAL STREET — DAY 49
The homes evoke pleasant nostalgia: front porches and white picket fences.

MARTY comes from around the corner and sees GEORGE’S BIKE parked underneath a
tree. Marty looks around, then spots

GEORGE up in the tree, precariously out on a branch overhanging the street, about 12 feet
up. George has a PAIR OF BINOCULARS trained on a second story window in the house
across the street.

MARTY can’t figure it out. He moves closer for a better view.

MARTY watches as George groans, then slowly tries to get up. Now a CAR comes from
around the corner.

George doesn’t see it, but Marty can see that it’s going to hit George.

MARTY
Dad! Look out!

But George is still dazed. Marty dashes into the street, and in a spectacular flying leap,
knocks him out of the path of the oncoming car.

As Marty moves to avoid the car, the car swerves in the SAME DIRECTION — there’s a
screech of brakes, and the car hits Marty!

George, never one to get involved, grabs his bike and pedals off, leaving Marty lying in the
street, unconscious.

DISSOLVE TO:

Take it easy, now... you’ve been asleep for almost9 hours.

MARTY
It was terrible. It was a terrible place to be. The music was awful —they
didn’t have rock. The cars were ugly. My neighborhood hadn’t been built
yet, and everything was so weird looking.

WOMAN
Well, you’re safe and sound, back where you belong, in good old 1955.

MARTY
1955!

She turns onthe bedside lamp. It’s the same girl George was spying on, and Marty
recognizes herjust as we do...

MARTY
Oh my God. You’re — you’re my— my—

LORRAINE
My name’s Lorraine. Lorraine Baines.

Marty stares at her for along moment.

MARTY
But — but you’re so thin!

LORRAINE
Just relax, Calvin. You got quite a bruise on your head.

MARTY
(looks underthe blankets)
Uh... where are my pants?

LORRAINE
(points)
Over there on the chair.
(notices the color of his undenNear)

I’ve never seen red underwear before, Calvin.

Marty covers himself up.

MARTY
Calvin? Why are you calling me Calvin?

LORRAINE
Well, isn’t that your name — Calvin Klein? It’s written in your underwear.
(suddenly realizing)
Oh — I guess people call you Cal.

MARTY
No, well, actually people call me Marty.

LORRAINE
Well, I’m pleased to meet you, Marty.

She comes over and sits on the bed right next to him. She’s very interested in him.

55

LORRAINE
Mind if I sit here?

MARTY
(gulps, nen/ous)
Uh... no...

Marty moves as far away as he can without falling off the bed. He holdsthe blanket tight
around his waist. She looks at him, fascinated.

LORRAINE
That is quite a bruise there...

She gently strokes his bruised forehead... and then runs her hand through his hair. Marty
moves even further — and falls off the bed! He covers himself with the blankets.

STELLA (08.)
Lorraine? Are you upthere?

We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.

LORRAINE
(to Marty)
It’s my mother! Quick, put your pants back on!
She throws him his pants. *
CUT TO:
INT. DINING ROOM — NIGHT 55

Marty takes a seat at the dinnertable next to Lorraine as MRS. STELLA BAINES, 40 and
pregnant, makes the introductions to the KIDS. The chair at the head of the table is empty. *

STELLA
That’s Milton, that’s Sally, that’s Toby...

MILTON, 12, wears a DAW CROCKETT COONSKIN CAP; SALLY is 6, TOBY is 4.

STELLA
(continuing)
...and next to you there in the playpen is little Joey.

Marty turns and looks with amazement at 11-month old JOEY rattling the bars of his
playpen.

MARTY
(whispers to him)
So you’re my Uncle Joey. Get used to those bars, kid.

STELLA
Oh, yes, little Joey loves being in his pen. He actually cries when we take
him out, so we leave him in there all the time — it seems to make him
happy. Have some meatloaf, Marty.

56

57

She hands him a plate of MEAT LOAF. It looks like the same meat loaf he had for dinner in
1985... in fact, the whole dinner is the same!

STELLA
(calls into the other room)
Sam, would you quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat?
(to Milton)
Milton, don’t eat so fast!
(to Lorraine)
Lorraine, you’re not eating enough. Have some mashed potatoes.

LORRAINE
No thanks, Mom.

Now gruff SAM BAINES, 45, rolls in a brand new television, on a plywood dolly of his own
construction.

SAM
Look at this: it rolls. Now we can watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

MILTON
Oh boy!

Sam fiddles with the rabbit ears and brings in a rather muddy image of a cigarette
commercial.

ON TV 56

a SURGEON steps out ofan operating room, lights up a cigarette, andturns to do a
testimonial.

DOCTOR (on TV)
After facing the tension of doing 3 lung operations in a row, I like to relax by
lighting up a “Sir Randolph.“ I know its fine tobacco taste will soothe my
nerves and improve my circulation...

SAM 57
Look at that picture: crystal clear! Why would anybodywant to go to the
movies when you can see this in your own home — free!

LORRAINE
(to Marty, explaining)
Our first television set. Dad picked it up today. Do you have a television?

MARTY

Uh... yeah... two of ‘em. *
MILTON

Wow! You must be rich!
STELLA

Milton, he’s teasing you. Nobody has two television sets. *

“The Honeymooners“ has resumed—the classic “Man From Space“ episode.

MARTY
Hey, I’ve seen this one —this is a good one. This is where Ralph dresses
up as “the man from space.“

MILTON
What do you mean, you’ve seen it? It’s brand new.

MARTY
I saw it on a rerun.

MILTON
What’s a rerun?

MARTY
You’ll find out.

SAM

Quiet! I want to hearthis!

STELLA

Marty, I’d like to give your mother a call and let her knowyou’re all right.

MARTY
(gives Lorraine a glance)
Uh, well, no — you can’t.

STELLA
Why not?

MARTY
Uh — she’s out oftown. With my Dad.
(pulls out the phone book page)
Could you tell me where Riverside Drive is?

SAM
Riverside? Sure, it’s on the east end of town, a block past Maple.
MARTY
A block past Maple? But that’s Kennedy Drive.
SAM
Pardon me?
MARTY
That’s John F. Kennedy Drive.
SAM

Who in the world is John F. Kennedy?

MARTY
(realizesthe problem)
Never mind.

LORRAINE
Mother, with Marty’s parents out oftown, don’t you think he should spend

the night here? I’d hate for anything to happen to him with that bruise on his
head.

She gives him a flirtatious smile.

STELLA
Marty, Lorraine is right. You must spend the night. You’re our responsibility.
MARTY
Uh, gee, I don’t know...
LORRAINE

And he can sleep in my room.

UNDER THE TABLE, Lorraine puts her hand on Marty’s leg. Marty immediatelyjumps to
his feet.

MARTY
Uh, actually, I’ve really gotta be going...
(he’s backing out, toward the front door)
So, thank you for everything, and I’ll see you all later. Much later.

He turns and hurries out of the house.

Lorraine sighs romantically.

60 EXT. DR. BROWN’S HOUSE 60

The house at 1640 Riverside Drive is spectacular, the home of a very wealthy man.

Marty ogles it as he walks up to the front door. He checks the address against the page he
ripped out of the phone book: it checks.

All the lights are on — a PARTY is going on inside. Marty rings the doorbell.

It’s answered by DR. BROWN, aged 35. Brown is dressed in evening clothes, and is
flanked by TWO LOVELY GIRLS. *

BROWN
Hiya, kid. Looking for some body?

MARTY
Uhhh, Dr. Brown — yeah, you ARE Dr. Brown... Boy, am I glad to see you.

BROWN *
Do I know you, kid?

MARTY
Well, not exactly — that is, not yet. My name’s Marty — Marty McFly. Now
what I’m about to say is going to sound incredible, but you’re the only man
on earth who’ll believe it...
(he takes a deep breath)
I’m from the future.

BROWN
(smiles)
Great sales pitch, kid — terrific. So what are you selling? Floor wax?

MARTY
No, I’m serious! You’ve gotta believe me! You’re the only one who can get
me back home!

BROWN
Get you back home? Kid, I think you got me confused with the Wizard of Oz.

MARTY
Look, I can prove I’m from 1985!

Marty pulls out his wallet and starts showing the contents to Brown.

MARTY
See this? My driver’s license — expires 1987. Look at my birthdate — I
haven’t even been born yet.
(pulls out a 20 dollar bill)
Look at this money: “Series 1981.“
(pulls out a color snapshot)
Here’s a picture of me, my sister, and my brother. Look at her sweatshirt: it
says “Class of ‘84.“

Brown gives it all a cursory look, particularly the snapshot.
BROWN
Oh, I get it — you’re selling trick film. This is great— it really looks like the

guy’s got no head. Very clever.

MARTY
Huh?

Brown hands it back to Marty. Marty looks at it.
INSERT — THE SNAPSHOT

Sure enough, the image of Dave in the photo has no head. It’s not torn, or rubbed off—
the figure genuinely is headless.

Brown rolls his eyes.
BROWN
Well then, tell me something, young man from the future: who’s the

president of the United States in 1985?

MARTY
Ronald Reagan.

Brown and the girls burst out laughing.
BROWN
That’s a good one! The kid’s a riot! A regular riot!
(pulls out his wallet)
Here’s 5 bucks, kid! Thanks forthe laughs!
He hands Marty a five, then closes the door.
Marty sighs, then walks around the side ofthe house and looks in the window.

MARTY’S P.O.V. TH RU THEWINDOW — BROWN’S LIVING ROOM 60-C*

The PARTY is an eclectic collection of SOCIETY TYPES, COLLEGE TYPES, BEAT
GENERATION TYPES, and lots of attractive WOMEN.

Brown wanders overto the best looking WOMAN in the place. Brown whispers into her ear.
She responds by hitting him in the head with a BEER BOTTLE! Brown goes down, dazed.

She walks off in a huff.

Brown rubs his head... then his eyes open wide in the same crazed expression we’ve seen
in 1985.

BROWN
Of course. Of course! It’s so obvious!
(jumps to his feet, shouts)
All right, the party’s over! Everybody go home! I have work to do!
The guests exchange looks.

INT. BROWN’S GARAGENVORKSHOP — NIGHT 64
It’s a large closed garage, with a PACKARD CONVERTIBLE and a large work area, *
organized and well-kept. *
A clock shows the time is 12:45. *
BROWN is hunched over his workbench, furiously scribbling down notes and plans. He’s
disheveled — he’s been here for a while.
Brown’s DOG is sitting near its “bed.“ The name on the dog dish is “COPERNICUS.”
Copernicus suddenly reacts to something...
MARTY appears at a partially open WINDOW. He opens it the rest of the way and climbs
in.
MARTY
Doc, listen, you gotta hear me out—
BROWN
Get lost kid! I’m working! *
MARTY
I know! And I know what you’re doing — you’re inventing time travel. It
came to you in a vision when you got hit over the head with that beer bottle.
And that thing you’re drawing is the T.F.C. — the Temporal Field Capacitor!
Brown is totally astonished.
BROWN
My God. How did you know that?
MARTY
I told you — I’m from the future.
With that, he walks over to the garage door and raises the overhead door, revealing THE
DELOREAN sitting there in the driveway.
Brown’s mouth falls open as he stares at it — and the mechanism visible through the open
gull wing door. He grabs the DRAWING he’s been working on and runs overto the
DeLorean to compare it.
It’s a DRAWING OF TIE T.F.C.! It matches the real thing perfectly.
CUT TO:
INT. BROWN’S GARAGE — A LITTLE LATER — NIGHT 65

The DeLorean is now in the garage; the garage door is closed. The 1985 suitcase is open,
and we can see its contents — clothes, toilet articles, and a CONAIR (battery) HAIR
DRYER.

MARTY is busily attaching the video camera into a 1953 model TV.

MARTY
Okay, Doc. Take a look at this... *

Brown comes over and Marty rolls the tape he shot in the mall parking lot where Brown is
explaining the operation of the time machine.

Brown is amazed to see himself as a man of 65.

BROWN
Why — that’s me! I’m an old man! Incredible! Thank God I’ve still got my
hair... baldness runs in my family, you know. But whaton earth am I
wearing?

MARTY
A radiation suit!

BROWN
Of course, because of all the fallout from the Atomic wars. And what’s that
thing around my neck?

MARTY
Indian jewelry.

BROWN
I‘m not even gonna ask.

66 ON TV 66

The part of the tape comes up aboutthe Plutonium. We see the image of the Plutonium
cannister with old Dr. Brown next to it.

MARTY
(V.O. tape)
Plutonium? You mean this sucker’s nuclear?

OLD BROWN
(on TV)
Electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 jigowatts of
electricity I need...

67 YOUNG BROWN is taken aback. 67
BROWN
1.21 JIGOWATTS? Kid, you’re outta gas, going no place fast.
MARTY
Huh?
BROWN

Look, I’m sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in any corner drug store.
But in 1955, it‘s a little hard to come by. And unless you figure on driving out
into a nuclear test site while an A-bomb’s going off, I’m afraid you’re stuck
here.

68

69

7O

71

MARTY
But isn’t there some other way to generate that kind of power?

BROWN
1.21 jigowatts? Oh, sure. We can tie into Hoover Dam with a very long
cable. Or we build a turbine on the back ofthis thing and you can drive it
over Niagara Falls. Or you can drive across the country at 88 miles an hour
and hope that you get struck by a bolt of lightning.

MARTY
Lightning! Hold the phone, Doc — check this out!

Marty pulls out the “Save the Clock Tower“ flyer from his pocket (with it isthe mysterious
“headless snapshot“ we saw earlier). Marty shows the flyer to Brown.

INSERT — FLYER 68

It includes a photocopy of a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE, dated March 27, 1955, with a picture
ofthe clock tower stopped at 10:02.“ The headline: “CLOCK TOWER STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING. CLOCK STOPPED AT 10:02.“

BACK TO SHOT 69
Brown reads it, nodding. He’s getting an idea.

BROWN
Kid, if this is true, wejust might be able to get your ass back to the future!
It’s totally insane, but it’s certainly no crazier than building a nuclear reactor
onto the back of a car... According to this, we know the exact moment
lightning will strike a specific spot — at 10:02 pm. and 11 seconds on next
Saturday. All I have to do is rig up a conducting system that’ll channel the
lightning directly into the T.F.C. As long as you’re doing 88 miles an hour
when it happens... See you later, alligator.

But Marty isn’t paying attention. He’s looking at the snapshot again, and he’s quite
concerned.

BROWN
What’s wrong, kid?

MARTY
I don’t know, but something weird is going on with this picture. My brother —
he’s fading out...

BROWN
Lemme see that...

Brown studies it. Hetoo reacts with concern.

EXT. HILL VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL — DAY 72

Hill Valley High looks pretty much the same in 1955, but with a little less graffiti. There is
not much activity in front — school is in session.

BROWN’S PACKARD pulls up and DR. BROWN and MARTY get out.

Marty is now dressed in total 1955 period garb. He and Brown ascend the school steps.
Marty seems unsure, confused.

MARTY
Are you sure about this?

BROWN
Figure it out, kid. Your old man was supposed to get hit by your Grandpa’s
car, not you—therefore, you interfered in your parents’ first meeting. Ifthey
don’t meet, they don’t fall in love; if they don’t fall in love, they don’t get
married; ifthey don’t get married they don’t have kids. That’s why your
older brother’s fading out — he’s being erased from existence. He’s first,
since he’s the oldest. Your sister’ll be next... and then you... unless you
repair the damage by getting your folks back together. Once you introduce
‘em to each other, nature will take its course.

(a beat)
I hope.

Marty pauses to check his reflection in the windowed door. He combs back his slicked
down hairin a ducktail, only to get a handful of “greasy kid stuf

MARTY
I can’t believe you actually put this crap in your hair.

BROWN
Come on kid, let’s get this over with.

Brown pulls him inside.

ANOTHER CLASSROOM DOOR opens and students head outforthe next class.
GEORGE McFLY is one of them. His shirt tail is out, his hair is poorly combed, and papers
are practically falling out of his 3-ring binder.

MARTY AND DR. BROWN watch from down the hall.

BROWN
So which one’s your father?

MARTY
(points)
That’s him...

As GEORGE walks down the hall, students laugh athim behind his back, and some of the
boys kick him in the ass.

George turns. He has a “KICK ME“ sign hooked on his collar. DR. BROWN shakes his
head at this pathetic sight.

BROWN
(to Marty)
Are you sure you’re not adopted?

Now a hand yanks George by the arm: MR. STRICKLAND — and he looks exactly the
same! Marty is amazed.

STRICKLAND
McFly! Shape up, man!

He pulls the sign off George’s shirt and shows it to him.

STRICKLAND
You’re a slacker! Do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life?

George shakes his head unconvincingly.

Marty and Brown look down the hall in the opposite direction where
LORRAINE is at her locker, giggling with a girl friend.

ON MARTY AND BROWN

BROWN
Looks like a match made in heaven.

MARTY
My mom always said it was meant to be. I sure hope she’s right...

Marty takes a deep breath and starts walking toward George.

MARTY
George! Hey, buddy, you’re just the guy I wanted to see! You remember me
— from Saturday? I saved your life, remember?

GEORGE
Oh...yeah...

MARTY
Listen, there’s somebody I want youto meet. C’mere...

He pulls him down the hall to Lorraine, who has her back to them.

MARTY
Excuse me, Lorraine...

Lorraine turns.

LORRAINE
Calvin! I mean, Marty!

She’s so delighted to see Marty, she drops her books.

MARTY
Oh, let me get those...

He picks up her books and gives them backto her. She’s totally infatuated.

LORRAINE
Thank you.

MARTY
Lorraine, I want to introduce you to someone. This is my good friend,
George McFly. George, this is Lorraine.

GEORGE
Hi. It’s really a pleasure to meet you.

Lorraine doesn’t pay George the slightest bit of attention. She only has eyes for Marty.
LORRAINE
Oh, Marty, I was so worried about you running off like that the other night

with that bruise on your head. Is it all right?

She hurries offdown the hall, joining a girl friend. They pass by Dr. Brown.

Isn’t he a dreamboat?

George has run off in the opposite direction. Marty stands in the middle of the hall,
completely bewildered.

Brown joins him.

MARTY
She didn’t even look at him!

BROWN
Obviously, you being in the picture is a real distraction for her. You’ve got to
get him to ask her out on a date — so they can be alone together.

MARTY
A date? What kinda date? I don’t know what kids do in the 50’s.
BROWN
What do they do in the 80’s?
MARTY
Sex and drugs and rock ‘n roll.
BROWN

No comment, kid.

Brown notices a hand-painted banner in the hall announcing the “Enchantment Under The
Sea Dance“ this Saturday night.

BROWN
Look — there’s a dance coming up. Get him to take herto that.

Marty sees the sign and has a revelation.
MARTY

That’s right! “Enchantment Under The Sea!“ They’re SUPPOSEDto go to
that dance — that’s where they kiss for the firsttime!

BROWN
Well then, kid, you gotta make sure they go to that dance. Together.

Silence! My heat ray will vaporize you if you do not obey me!

George raises his hands in surrender.

GEORGE
All right! I surrender! Turn it off!

Marty lowers it. Now his digital watch alarm begins BEEPING. Marty raises his wrist as if it
were a radio.

MARTY
Silence! I am receiving a transmission from the BattlestarGalactica!
(after several more beeps)
You, George McFly, have created a rift in the space-time continuum. The
Supreme Klingon hereby commands you to take the female earth-person
called “Baines Lorraine“ to the location known to you as Hill Valley High
School exactly 4 earth cycles from now — Saturday night in your language.

GEORGE
You mean, take Lorraine to the dance?
MARTY
Affirmative.
GEORGE

But I don’t know if I’ll be able—

Marty turns on the Walkman again. George SCREAMS!

87

88

GEORGE
Turn if off! Please, turn it off!

Martyturns it off.

MARTY
Insolent Earthling! Do you wish me to melt your brain?

GEORGE
No! Please! I’m sorry, I’ll do it! I’ll take herto the dance — but please don’t
turn that noise on again.

MARTY
Very good, Earthling. You will tell no one of this visit. Now, close your eyes,
and see me no more...

GEORGE
Okay, Okay.

George closes his eyes.

Marty holds a vial under George’s nose and George passes out. Marty removes the
featherweight headphones from George’s head, takes off his hood, and goes back out the
window.

EXT. GEORGE’S HOUSE — NIGHT 87

Marty climbs down a trellis and jumps down into Dr. Brown’s waiting Packard convertible. *

BROWN
How’d it go?
MARTY
Great! That chloroform sure put him out — I hope I didn‘t overdo it.
CUT TO:
EXT. TOWN SQUARE — DAY 88

MARTY is 1oitering in the grassy town square. Now GEORGE comes running up from the
street. He’s disheveled and wild-eyed.

MARTY
(spots him)
George! You weren’t at school. Where’ve you been all day?
GEORGE
Ijust woke up — I overslept. Look, you’ve gotta help me! I want to ask

Lorraine out, but I don’t know how to do it.

MARTY
All right, keep your pants on. She’s overthere in the cafe, having a soda.
Come on...

They head across the street toward the CAFE — it’s the Iocalteen after school hangout.

91

TWO KIDS on homemade scooters (roller skates nailed to a 2 x 4 with an orange crate on
top) cruise down the sidewalk past them.

Marty points through the café window.

MARTY
Look, there she is.

THEIR P.O.V. THRU THE WINDOW OF 89

LORRAINE, seated with 2 GIRLFRIENDS (BETTY and BABS) in a booth, sipping ice
cream sodas andtalking.

BACK TO SHOT 90
MARTY
It’s simple, George. You justgo in there and invite her.
GEORGE
All right. but what do I say?
MARTY

Say whatever feels natural — whatever comes to your mind.

George thinks about this a moment, then shrugs.

GEORGE
Nothing’s coming to my mind.
MARTY
Christ, it’s a miracle I was even born.
GEORGE
Huh?
MARTY

Nothing. Just tell her destiny has brought you to her and you think she’s the
most beautiful girl you’ve ever seen. Girls like to hear that — what are you
doing, George?

George has taken out pencil and paper and is writing.

GEORGE
I’m writing it down. This is good stuff.

INT. CAFE — DAY 91
The place is reallyjumping — it’s full of kids. AJUKEBOXis playing.
Marty enters with George.

MARTY
There she is. Just go and ask her.

Marty points George in the right direction, and takes a stool at the counter, out of

Lorraine’s immediate view.

George looks at his “script“ and mouths the words to himself. He gets up his nerve and
approaches Lorraine. Despite his awkwardness and fear, there’s something endearing
about him, like a lost dog.

GEORGE
Uh, Lorraine...
(reads)
“My density has brought me to you.“

LORRAINE
I beg your pardon?

GEORGE
Oh — what I mean to say is...

LORRAINE

(looks at him curiously)
Haven’t I seen you somewhere?

GEORGE
(big smile)
Yes! I’m George. George McFIy. I’m your density — I mean, destiny.
Lorraine giggles with her girl friends.

We hear the sound of the door being thrown open and a familiar VOICE calls to George.

BIFF (O.S.)
McFly, I thought I told you neverto come in here!

George turns and sees Biffand his gang standing there. He shudders.
Marty drops his head in his hands and sighs.

BIFF
Well, it’s gonna cost you, McFIy. How much money you got on you?

GEORGE
(quickly pulls out his wallet)
How much do you want, Biff?

As Biff starts to walk toward George, Marty sticks out his leg and TRIPS HIM! Everyone in

the malt shop laughs, but Biffdoesn’tthink it’s very funny. Now Biff sees who tripped him.

BIFF
You!
(getting up)
All right, wise ass, it’s fat lip time...

Martyjumps off his stool, ready for action. Biff throws a punch which Marty easily avoids;
then Marty delivers a Ieftjabto Biff’s gut, and slams a right into his face, sending Biff
reeling backward into a table.

Match, 3-D and Skinhead rush Marty.
Marty doesn’t like the odds. He bolts out.
The 3 guys pull Biff to his feet and they all run out after Marty.
LORRAINE
(to her girlfriends)
That’s Calvin Klein! Oh, God, he’s a dream!
EXT. CAFE AND STREET 92

Marty dashes down the street, followed by Biffand the boys. Most ofthe kids in the café
hurry outside to watch, including LORRAINE and her friends.

Marty looks behind him — Biff and company are gaining. Then one of the kids on the
scooters comes by. Thinking quickly, Marty yanks the scooter outfrom under him, kicks off
the orange crate and creates a homemade SKATEBOARD! Marty hops on it and sails off
down the sidewalk!

Biff and the boys have never seen anything like it — nor has the kid whose scooter it was!
Everyone stares as Marty whizzes down the sidewalk.

KID
Wow! Look at him go!
ANOTHER KID
What is thatthing?
BIFF

(to his boys)
In the car!

Biff and the gang jump into Biff’s convertible parked nearby. Biff peels out after Marty.
FURTHER DOWN THE STREET 93

Marty looks over his shoulder and sees the convertible closing in. He cuts a sharp turn into
the street, crossing right in front of Biff’s car, and heads back in the opposite direction.

INT. BIFF’S MOVING CONVERTIBLE 93-A
Biff and the boys are stunned! *
EXT. STREET 94

Another car comes up from behind Marty. As it passes, Marty grabs onto the back and
hooks a ride!

Biff cuts a U-Turn and continues the pursuit.
EXT. CAFE 95

Marty, towed bythe car, zooms past the cafe. The spectators are truly amazed. Lorraine
stares in open-mouthed awe.

LORRAINE
He’s an absolute dream...!

Now Biff’s convertible comes racing after Marty.

MARTY 95-A
again looks over his shoulder and sees that Biff is closing in, fast. Things don’t look good.

Up ahead is an intersecting street: Hill Street. Marty lets go of the car and cuts a sharp left
onto Hill Street.

BIFF
is coming too fast to make the turn. He overshoots the intersection and has to make 95-B
another U.

His boys are watching Marty with amazement.

MATCH *
What is that thing he’s on? *
SKINHEAD *
It’s a board with a roller skate nailed under it. *
3 -D *
Hey — we could build those things and sell ‘em — we could call ‘em “Roller *
Boards!“ *
EXT. HILL STREET 96

It’s an incredibly steep hill, and at the bottom is a
railroad crossing. Marty acoelerates and he coasts down. Now Biff’s convertible shoots
onto Hill Street, actually lifting off the ground as it comes over the hill!

Biff drives like hell after Marty and he’s closing fast. Then Marty drops into a crouch, cuts
his wind resistance and speeds away!

AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING, 97
the warning bells start ringing andthe gate begins to lower.

Marty reacts with fear.

A Diesel Freight is approaching.

The gate drops all the way down.

Biff speeds upto stay on Marty’s tail.

Marty has no choice — he vaults overthe crossing gate and lands back on his 98
“skateboard,“ crossing the tracks just inches in front ofthe barreling Diesel!

Biff slams on his brakes. His wheels lock up and rubber SCREECHES across the 99
pavement... but nevertheless, he CRASHES through the crossing gate, coming to a stop
right at the edge of the tracks... and the Diesel engine runs over his front bumper!

99-A MARTY

99-B

100

continues on with a euphoric yell as the train roars on behind him, oompletely cutting off
Biff’s pursuit.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS,
BIFF is pissed.

BIFF
I’m gonna get that son of a bitch.

CUT TO:
EXT. TOWN SQUARE — LATER
Time has passed; things are quiet at the café.

Marty comes gliding down the street on his “skateboard,“ looking around for somebody. He
hops off and sticks his head inthe cafe.

MARTY
George?

VOICE (08.)
Hi, Calvin — I mean, Marty.

Marty turns: LORRAINE is standing on the sidewalk behind him.

MARTY
Oh, hi.

LORRAINE
You know, you’re the first person who’s ever given Biff a taste of his own
medicine.

Marty shrugs if off as no big deal.
She moves toward him. He backs away.

LORRAINE
Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was hoping you might take meto
the “Enchantment Underthe Sea“ Dance on Saturday.

MARTY
Uh, well, funny you should bring that up, because you know who really
wants to take you, and I really think you’d hit it off with him, is George

McFIy.
LORRAINE
Yeah, he asked me, but I turned him down.
MARTY
You did WHAT?
LORRAINE

George just isn’t my type. He’s sort of cute and all, but he’s such a... well,

99-A

99-B

100

you know, a chicken.

(moving closerto him)
I think a man should be strong...so he can protect the woman he loves.
Don’t you?

She moves closer. Marty gulps. This is REALLY getting out of hand!

LORRAINE
So what do you say about Saturday?

MARTY
Uh...well...yeah, sure. Okay. It’ll be...great You and me... on a...
(coughs, nearly chokes)
...date.

CUT TO:
101 INT. BROWN’S GARAGE — NIGHT 101
Brown is shocked to hear what Marty hasjust told him.

BROWN
What do you mean you said “yes“?

MARTY
I had to. At least that way I’ll know she’ll be there. Now all I’ve gotta do is
figure out some way to make her end up with George.

BROWN
You’re not gonna have much time, kid. You’ve gotta make everything
happen by 9:30 — 9:45 at the latest — because you’ve gotta beat it back to
the courthouse square in time for the fireworks.

Come here, I’ll show you the set-up.

Brown takes him over to a CRUDE PLYWOOD TABLETOP MODEL of Hill Valley town
square which he’s constructed himself.

A “lightning rod“ (a nail) has been attached to the top of the “clock tower“ (a piece of wood
with a watch strapped around it). A wire runs down from the “lightning rod,“ across “town
square“ and between two “lamp posts“ (candles in candlesticks) across the “street.“

Brown explains the layout to Marty.

BROWN
We put a lightning rod on the clock tower and we run some industrial
strength electrical cable from the lightning rod, across the street. *
Meanwhile, we’ve outfitted your car with a big hook directly connected into
the T.F.C....

x-

Brown brings out a wind-up toy car with a wire sticking straight up from the back. There’s a
hook on the top of it. (There is a similar rig on the real DeLorean, visible in the
background.) Brown winds up the toy car.

BROWN

102

103

104

(continuing)
On a signal, you’ll take off down the street toward the cable, accelerating to
88...

Brown releases the toy car from one end of the model, toward the strung wire...

He picks up a STRIPPED WIRE, plugged into the AC outlet and brings ittoward the
“lightning rod.“

BROWN
(continuing)
Lightning strikes, electrifying the cable, just in time to...

He touches the live wire to the nail. Thetoy car’s antenna snags the cable. SPARKS FLY,
and the toy car catches FIRE! It flies off the table top, into some drapes, and they catch fire
as well!

Brown grabs a FIRE EXTINGUISHER and puts everything out. Marty shakes his head.

MARTY
You’re instilling me with a lot of confidence here, Doc.
BROWN
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of the lightning. You just take care of your old

man.
Marty has another look at the fateful snapshot.
INSERT — SNAPSHOT 102

Dave is entirely gone, and now Linda’s head is beginning to go.

MARTY 103
gulps.
MARTY
Yeah...
CUT TO:
EXT. GEORGE’S BACKYARD — DAY 104

GEORGE seems very bewildered about what MARTY has been trying to explain to him.

GEORGE
I still don’t understand. How can I goto the dance with her if she’s going
with YOU?
MARTY

She wants to go with YOU George — she just doesn’t know it yet. That’s
why we’ve gotta convince her that you’re not a chicken — so she’ll realize
that.

Now come on, hit me in the stomach. Right here, go ahead.

Marty makes himself a target, but George seems quite unwilling. In the background, a
homemade body bag (a duffel bag filled with clothes) is hanging from a clothesline pole.

GEORGE
I don’t want to hit you in the stomach.
MARTY
You’re not gonna hurt me. Just give me a punch.
GEORGE
Look, I’m not a fighter.
MARTY

How many times do I have to explain itto you? We know you’re not a
fighter. You know it, I know it...but she doesn’t know it. That’s why we’ve
gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who’ll stand upfor her,
somebody who’ll protect her. And you’re not gonna look like a fighter if you
can’t hit me in the stomach.

GEORGE
But I’ve never picked a fight in my life!

MARTY
You’re not picking a fight, you’re coming to her rescue. Maybe we’d better
go overthe plan again.

Where are you gonna be at 8:55?

GEORGE
At the dance.
MARTY
And where am I gonna be?
GEORGE
In the parking lot, with her.
MARTY
Okay. So right around 9:00, she’s gonna get very angry with me—
GEORGE
Why?
MARTY
Why what?
GEORGE

Why is she gonna get angry with you?

MARTY
(it’s hard for him to say)
Well...because...well, nice girls get angry at guys who... who tryto take
advantage of‘em.

GEORGE
You mean you’re gonna—

MARTY
George, don’t worry about it. Just rememberthat at 9 o’clock, you’ll be
strolling through the parking lot and you’ll see us...

, (gulps)
...struggling in the car, you I! run over, open the door, and say...?

George doesn’t say anything.

MARTY
Your line, George.

GEORGE
Oh. Uh... “Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her.“ You really think!
should swear?

MARTY
Yes, definitely, George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down
forthe count, and you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

GEORGE
You make it sound so easy. I wish I wasn’t so scared.

MARTY
There’s nothing to be scared of. Now come on and hit me in the stomach.

George takes a deep breath and throws aflimsy pund't into Marty’s gut.

MARTY
No, George, put a little emotion into it. A little hostility, a little anger.

George tries to get himself angry. He makes some faces and throws another punch. It’s
not much better.

MARTY
Anger, George, anger.
GEORGE
Maybe if! used my left...
MARTY

No, George. Just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
George throws another punch. This one is slightly better than the last one.

MARTY

(sighs)
Well... I think you’re starting to get the hang of it. Just keep practicing. I’ll
see you later. Remember, anger, George. Anger.

Marty walks off, leaving George with the body bag. He stares at it, trying to make himself
mad.

105

GEORGE
...anger...

He hits it. He hits it again, harder... again... harder... again —he hits the tree! George
howls in pain!

GEORGE
Yeeeowww!! Goddammit!!

He’s really angry now, and he socks the bag with his left — and KNOCKS IT CLEAR OFF
THE TREE!

George is astonished! 105
EXT. TOWN SQUARE CLOCK TOWER — NIGHT
It’s a few minutes before 8 o’clock.

We hear a RADIO WEATHER FORECAST as the CAMERA takes us from the lightning rod
atop the clock tower, along the cable strung down across the square, to the STREET
where Brown’s Packard is parked nearby —the weather report emanates from the car
radio.

BROWN is on a ladder; he’s connecting the paddle plug end of the clock tower cable to the
socket on an extension cable tied around a lamp post.

The DeLorean is nearby covered with a tarp. MARTY arrives, dressed up for the dance.

FORECASTER
(V.O. radio)
Area weather on this Saturday night: An electrical storm in the vicinity will
bypass Hill Valley, but we can expect continued cloudiness and some light
rain...

Brown reacts to the weather report.

BROWN
Kid, are you sure about this storm?

MARTY
Doc, since when can a weatherman predict the weather — let alone the
future?

Brown smiles. He plugs in the cables, then descends the ladder.

BROWN
Right.

(a beat)
You know, kid, I... well, I’m gonna be sad to see you go. You’ve really made
a difference in my life — you’ve given me something to shoot for. Just
knowing that I’m gonna live to see 1985... that I’ll succeed in this... that I’ll
get a chance to travel through time... well, it‘sjust gonna be hard for me to
wait 30 years before we can talk about everything that’s happened in the
past few days. I‘m gonna really miss you.

106

107

108

109

Marty is particularly uncomfortable, knowing the fate of Dr. Brown.

MARTY
Yeah... uh, Doc, about the future...

BROWN
No, kid. We’ve already agreed that having knowledge of the future can be
extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, it could backfire
drastically. Whatever it is you want to tell me, I’ll find out through the natural
course of time.

This is notwhat Marty wanted to hear, but he can see there’s no arguing with Brown.

MARTY
(sighs)
Yeah... Listen, I’m gonna get a candy bar orsomething. You want anything?
BROWN
No thanks.
CUT TO:
INT. CAFE — INSERT — ON A LETTER 106
as a HAND with a pen writes.
INT. CAFE — WIDE ANGLE — NIGHT 107

MARTY is sitting at a booth writing. He reads it over.

MARTY
“Dr. Brown, on October 5, 1985, at about 1:30 am, you will be shot by
terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this
terrible disaster. Yourfriend, Marty. March 26, 1955.“

Satisfied, Marty folds the letter, puts it in an envelope, and writes something on it.

INSERT — ENVELOPE 108
“Dr. Brown: do not open until October 1, 1985.“

CUT TO:

EXT. ON STREET — NIGHT 109
Brown is on the ladder stringing electrical cable across the street, between the two lamp

posts. MARTY returns with a candy bar. Brown’s trenchcoat is laying on the tarped

DeLorean. Making sure that Brown isn’t watching, Marty surreptitiously places the

ENVELOPE into a pocket.

Now a COP meanders over and watches.

COP
Evening, Dr. Brown. What’s with the wire?

110

111

BROWN
Oh, I’m just doing a little weather experiment.

COP
(notices the tarped DeLorean)
And what’s under here?

BROWN
Some new specialized weather sensing equipment.

Brown comes down from the ladder.

COP
You got a permit for this?

BROWN
(smiles)
Of course I do... right here.

He takes out his wallet and gives the cop a 50 dollar bill.
COP
(hesitant)

You’re... not going to set anything on fire this time, are you, Dr. Brown?

Brown looks to Marty for guidance. Marty shakes his head.

BROWN

(to cop)
Naw.

COP
In that case, good luck.
He continues down the street.

BROWN
Thank you, officer.

(to Marty)

Say, kid, you’d better pick up your mom and getgoing.

Marty is about to get into the Packard. He hesitates and pulls the snapshot out of his
pocket.

INSERT — SNAPSHOT

Marty is the only one in the picture now, it’s as if his siblings never existed.
BACK TO SHOT

Marty stares at it, then puts it back in his pocket. He is uneasy and scared.

Oh sure, I feel great. Why shouldn’t I? I’m going on a hot date with my
mother.

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM — DANCE — NIGHT 112

“Enchantment Under The Sea“ is well undenNay.

On stage is the band: Marvin Berry and the Midnighters. They’re all black. Marvin plays

lead guitar and sings; there is also a drummer, piano player, sax and bass. They’re playing

“3 Coins In The Fountain.“

The gym has been decorated in an undersea motif: seaweed, fish on the walls, a paper

mache sunken ship, a “treasure chest,“ and a single school locker labeled “Davey Jones.“

There is also a BUBBLE MACHINE, ala Lawrence Welk.

As usual at school dances, there are teachers acting as chaperones (including Mr.

Strickland), a busy refreshment table (including a cake in the shape of a fish), and

wallflowers on the sidelines.

GEORGE is on the sidelines, bopping out of time to the music. He’s quite neryous.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT 113

Brown’s Packard pulls into the lot and parks.

INT. PACKARD — MARTY, LORRAINE 114

Marty, atthe wheel, is very uneasy; Lorraine next to him looks beautiful in her best party
dress. Marty glances at the clock onthe dashboard. It’s 8 minutes before 9.

MARTY
Uh, you don’t mind if we, uh, park for afew minutes...?
LORRAINE
Why do youthink I’d mind?
MARTY

Well, I don’t know, some girlsjust don’t like to...

LORRAINE
Marty, I’m almost 18 years old. It’s not like I’ve never parked before.

She scoots over, very close to him. Marty fidgets. Boy, is he neryous!

LORRAINE
You seem nervous, Marty. Is anything wrong?
MARTY
Uh, no...
LORRAINE

Have some ofthis — it’ll help you relax.

She pulls a pint bottle of gin out of her purse. Marty is shocked.

MARTY
What are you doing with that?

LORRAINE
I swiped it from the old man’s liquor cabinet.

She takes a nip.

MARTY
Lorraine, you shouldn’t drink!
LORRAINE
Why not?
MARTY
Well, it’s just not healthy.
LORRAINE

Don’t be so square, Marty. Everybody who’s anybody does it.

She hands itto him.

MARTY

Maybe I could use a hit....

Just as he takes a swig, she pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights up. Marty spits out the
gin in surprise.

MARTY
Jesus — you smoke, too?

LORRAINE
Now, Marty, you’re not going to tell me that smoking is unhealthy. Everyone
knows that it calms your neryes and it’s good for the circulation.

MARTY
It’ll give you cancer!

LORRAINE
You know, you sound just like my mother. When I have kids. I’m gonna let
them do anything they want. Anything.

MARTY
I’d sure like to have that in writing.

The comment goes right past Lorraine.

LORRAINE
So what are your parents like? Are they as square as mine?

MARTY
Lorraine, lately I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t know anything about ‘em.

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM — THE DANCE 115

Man/in Berry andthe Midnighters finish up a number. Everyone applauds. Man/in steps up
to the microphone.

MARVIN
We’re gonna take a break now, but we’ll be back in just a little while, so
don’t go away.

The band members leave their instruments on the stage and head out a side door.

GEORGE now glances at the clock in the gym. It says “8:59.“ Alarmed, he checks his own
watch.

INSERT — GEORGE’S WATCH which reads “8:55.“ 116
GEORGE 117
is even more alarmed. He runs overto a nearby STUDENT.
GEORGE
What time do you have?
STUDENT

Five after nine.
George is panic stricken! He runs like hell out of the gym!
INT. PACKARD — MARTY, LORRAINE — NIGHT 118
Marty fidgets and looks at the clock again.

LORRAINE
Marty, why are you so neryous?

Marty takes a deep breath.

MARTY
Well, have you ever been in a situation where, well, you know you have to

act a certain way, but when you get there, you don’t know ifyou can go
through with it?

LORRAINE
You mean like how you’re supposed to act with someone on a first date?
MARTY
Well, sort of...
LORRAINE

I think I know exactly what you mean.

MARTY
You do?

119

120

LORRAINE
(nods)
And you know what I do in those situations?

Marty looks at her.

LORRAINE
I don’t worry about it!

And with that, she throws herself on him, kissing him passionately. Marty is absolutely
shocked!

INT. SCHOOL HALL — NIGHT 119
George is in a PHONE BOOTH, dialing a number. It rings and a WOMAN answers.

WOMAN
(V.O. phone)
At the tone, the time will be nine o’clock, exactly....

A KID named DIXON (class prankstertype) sticks a broom through the phone booth door
handle. George tries to get out, buthe’s trapped. *

Dixon LAUGHS loudly.
George jerks the door frantically, and Dixon just laughs louder.
INT. PACKARD — NIGHT 120

Lorraine continues her passionate assault of Marty — then abruptly stops and pushes him
away. She’s very confused.

LORRAINE
This isn’t right.
(sighs)
I don’t know what it is, but... when I kiss you, something’s wrong. I almost
feel like... like I was kissing my brother... or my father. I don’t understand it,
but I just know it’s wrong. I guess that doesn’t make any sense, does it?

MARTY
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

We hear the sounds of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS on gravel.

LORRAINE
Sounds like somebody’s coming.

Marty hears it too. He looks at the dashboard olock: 9:00. He sighs with defeat.

MARTY
Yeah... I know..

Suddenly the driver’s door is opened, an arm reaches in, yanks Marty out, and Marty finds
himself face to face with
BIFF!

121

Match, 3-D and Skinhead are with him.

BIFF
You caused $300 damage to my car, dipshit. And I’m gonna take itoutta
your ass... Hold him, guys.

Biffshoves him roughly into the arms of Skinhead. Marty struggles, but Skinhead and
Match grab him and restrain him

LORRAINE
Let go of him! Leave him alone, Biff! You’re drunk.

Biff takes a look at Lorraine in the car.

BIFF
Well, lookee what we have here. Maybe I’ll take it out of your ass...

She lunges at her doorto escape, but Biff grabs her and climbs into the car.

BIFF
Oh, no, you’re stayin’ right here with me.

Biff pulls her toward him.

MARTY
Get you hands off her, you son-of-a-bitch.

Biff leers at Marty.

BIFF
I’ll take care of you after I take care of her. (to his boys) Take him around
back. I’ll be there in a minute.
(a beat)
Go on! This ain’t no peepshow!

They drag Marty away. Biffshuts the car door and tries to kiss her. She struggles, and in a
moment, all we can seethrough the windshield are tussling arms and legs, accompanied
by Lorraine’s muffled screams.

EXT. SIDE OF SCHOOL 121

Skinhead, Match and 3-D drag Marty around the cornerto the side of the schoolwhere a
CADILLAC is parked with its trunk open.

SKINHEAD
Hey — let’s lock him in that trunk!

They throw Marty into the car trunk and slam the lid shut. Then, the Cadillac’s driver’s door
is thrown open and the DRUMMER from the band steps out. He’s smoking a reefer.

DRUMMER
Say, what you messin’ with my car for?

3-D
Beat it, spook, this don’t concern you!

122

123

The other 3 car doors open, and MARVIN BERRY and the OTHER BAND MEMBERS get
out. They look real “bad“ with their processed hair.

MARVIN
Who you callin’ “spook,“ peckerwood?

Biff’s boys exchange worried looks as the band members advance on them.

SKINHEAD
Hey, I don’t want to mess with no reefer addicts!

Biff’s boys take off (in the opposite direction from the Packard), but Marvin and the band
manage to kick ‘em all in the ass as they run away.

Now we hear beating on the trunk from the inside, and Marty’s muffled voice.

MARTY’S VOICE
Lemme out! Lemme out!

MARVIN
Hey, Reginald, where’s your keys?

The drummer checks his pockets, and inside the car. He can’t find them.

MARTY’S VOICE
They’re in here! The keys are in here!

MARVIN
Dammit, boy, you left them suckers in the trunk!

INT. — PACKARD 122
Lorraine is trying to fight off Biff. It’s a real struggle for her.
EXT. PARKING LOT — ON THE PACKARD 123

Through the windshield we see arms and legs flailing about in a struggle. We hear
SCREAMING.

Now GEORGE arrives. He spots the car and goes into his act. He adjusts his pants, strides
to the car like John Wayne, and opensthe driver’s door.

GEORGE
Hey, you! Get your damn hands — uh, oh!

George realizes he’s facing Biff. Now he’s really scared.

BIFF
I think you got the wrong car, McFIy.

LORRAINE
George! Help me!

George doesn’t know what to do. He stares in dumbfounded amazement.

124

125

BIFF
Just close the door, McFly and walk away.

GEORGE
Uh, okay, Biff...

He turns and takes a few steps.

LORRAINE
George! Please! Help me!

George can’t stand it. He stops and goes back. He takes a deep breath.

GEORGE
All right, Biff. You let her alone.
BIFF
Who’s gonna make me?
GEORGE
(QUIPS)

I am.
Biff steps out of the car and laughs loudly.

BIFF
Yeah? You and what army, McFly?

George balls his right hand into a fist and takes a swing at Biff— but Biff grabs his arm
and starts twisting it.

George grimaces.
EXT. AT THE CADILLAC 124

Meanwhile, Man/in is trying to pop the trunk lock with a screwdriver. He’s not having much
luck.

EXT. PACKARD 125
Biff twists George’s arm harder.

LORRAINE
Stop it, Biff! You’ll break his arm!

She tries to pull him away. He slaps her backhand, knocking her down.
Biff laughs.

George’s expression immediately goes from pain to rage— intense rage... and George
lets go with a TREMENDOUS LEFT HOOK, SMACK INTO BIFF’S FACE!

Biff hits the ground, out cold!

George can’t believe he did it! He looks at his fist, looks down at Biff, and grins widely.

LORRAINE
Oh, George, you were wonderful!

She looks at him with adoring eyes.
126 AT THE CADILLAC 126

Man/in has his screwdriver in the lock. He gives it a hard jerk: thetrunk pops open, but he
puts a big gash in his hand.

MARVIN
Damnit — I sliced my hand!
Martyjumps out of the trunk.
MARTY
Thanks a lot!
He dashes back toward the Packard.
127 MARTY 127

rushes onto the parking lot and is astonished to see GEORGE AND LORRAINE
EMBRACING... and BIFF out cold onthe ground. He keeps his distance, allowing them to
have their moment.
Nearby, a few KID BYSTANDERS come over to them.
BYSTANDER #1
George, we never knew you had it in you!
BYSTANDER #2

Yeah! Everthink aboutgoing out forthe team?

BYSTANDER #3
How about running for class president?

GEORGE
Well, I‘ll have to think about it.

Marty can’t believe what he’s hearing.
Now George and Lorraine head for the school.
128 EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL 128

George and Lorraine go up the front stairs. Marty watches from a safe distance away. Just
as they’re aboutto go in, Lorraine turns and sees Marty. She smiles. He smiles back.

Now Marty pulls outthe snapshot and takes a look.
129 INSERT—SNAPSHOT 129

Marty’s own image is beginning to fade.

In the background, we hear distant THUNDER.

MARTY 130
is shocked. He considers the situation a moment, then realizes the answer. He runs back
toward the Cadillac.

AT THE CADILLAC 131
Marvin is wrapping a handkerchief around his cut hand while the band looks on.
Marty runs overto them.

MARTY
Hey, you guys, you’ve gotta get back in there and finish the dance!

MARVIN
Sorry, my friend, but we’re through fortonight.

MARTY
What do you mean, you’re through?

DRUMMER
Look at Man/in’s hand! He can’t play with it like that. And we can’t play
without Marvin.

MARTY
But you’ve gotta play! That’s where they kiss for the first time — on the
dance floor! Ifthere’s no music, they won’t dance, they won’t kiss, they
won’t fall in love.., and I’m a goner!

DRUMMER
Hey, man, the dance is over... unless you know somebody who can play
guitar.
Marty looks at Man/in and smiles.
CUT TO:
INT. SCHOOL GYM 132

Marty is playing the guitar with the Midnighters, in a version of “Earth Angel.“
George and Lorraine are on the floor, dancing.

Marty looks at them, then looks at the back of his guitar where, attached with chewing gum.
is the snapshot. Nothing has changed. Marty watches his parents. He’s getting neryous.

GEORGE AND LORRAINE are looking at each other as they dance. George seems a little
unsure of himself.

LORRAINE
Aren’t you going to kiss me, George?

133

134

135

GEORGE
(uncertain)
Well... I don’t know...

Now DIXON butts in.

DIXON
Beat it, McFly, I’m cuttin’ in.

He pushes George out of the way. ON STAGE, Marty reacts with horror. He looks at the
snapshot.

INSERT — SNAPSHOT 133
Marty’s image is definitely fading!

MARTY 134
blinks his eyes and start hitting wrong notes. He doesn’t seem to be able to playthe guitar
anymore.

The DRUMMER notices this.

DRUMMER
Hey, man...what’s wrong?

MARTY
I can’t play! I don’t know how to play the guitar!

ON THE DANCE FLOOR, Dixon has his hands all over Lorraine. Lorraine doesn’t like it.
She looks to George with pleading eyes.

MARTY is turning pale. He can barely stand up.

MARTY
I don’t feel so good...

The band keeps on playing.
GEORGE sees Dixon with Lorraine. His anger rises and he strides over the them.
GEORGE
(to Dixon)
Get lost, jerk!

He yanks Dixon away from Lorraine and shoves him hard, sending him sprawling into the
refreshment table — right into the punch bowl!

George takes Lorraine in his arms and kisses her!

ON STAGE, Marty immediately recovers! He jumps up, full of life, wired with energy. The
color returns to his face, and he looks at the snapshot.

INSERT— SNAPSHOT 135

Marty’s image is now sharp and clear, and his sister and brother are fading back in!

ON THE DANCE FLOOR 136

George and Lorraine are dancing very close. From the looks on their faces, there can be
no doubt: they’re in love.

GEORGE
You know, I’m gonna write all this up in a story and send it in for publication.

LORRAINE
I thought you only wrote science fiction.

GEORGE
It IS science fiction.

INSERT — SNAPSHOT 137
The photo is now as it was originally, with Marty, Linda and Dave al|“back in existence.“
ON STAGE 138

Marty is euphoric. He remembers how to play, and jumps into the opening riff of “Johnny B.
Goode!“

MARTY
(to the band)
Follow me, fellas! Let’s rock ‘n roll!
The band joins in.

SERIES OF SHOTS — DANCE NUMBER

ON THE DANCE FLOOR, heads turn. There are reactions of astonishment from everyone
— and the kids start dancing.

Marty euphorically begins cavorting around like Little Richard!
The band is really getting into it.
And the kids all go nuts, jumping and screaming.
Mr. Strickland, however, just shakes his head with disgust.
Marty whips off his sport coat and throws it into the crowd!
INT. BACK STAGE — PUBLIC TELEPHONE 139
MARVIN BERRY is on the phone.

MARVIN

Chuck? This is Marvin!
(pauses)

Marvin Berry! Your cousin! Now, listen— I thinkthis is the sound you’ve
been looking for...

140

141

142

He holds the phone toward the music.

INT. SCHOOL GYM 140
The pandemonium continues.

Now Marty tears open his shirt and does some Elvis pelvis moves.

Girls scream!

Marty’s movements become Mick Jaggeresque, then take on a Michael Jackson style...

Finally he drifts into pure HEAVY METAL, puts his guitar next to the amp, making

FEEDBACK.

This goes a little too far for 1955 musical tastes — the band stops playing, and the kids
stop dancing. They all watch Marty, notsure what to think.

Marty suddenly realizes he’s gone too far. He smiles sheepishly and steps up to the
microphone.

MARTY
Uh, sorry, you guys aren’t ready forthat yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

He picks up the song again with the band. They do one more chorus.

Marty wraps up the song with a final riff, and the students all go berserk with applause!

CUT TO:

EXT. CLOCK TOWER — NIGHT 141
It’s 4 minutes before 10:00.

ON THE STREET 142
BROWN, wearing the trenchcoat, paces back and forth anxiously. The wind is picking up,

and we hear DISTANT THUNDER. The entire “lightning rod setup“ is complete, with the

cable strung across the street between the two Iampposts. Brown checks his wristwatch:

9:56.

BROWN
Damn! Where is that kid?

Brown pulls out a pocket watch and checks it: 9:56.

BROWN
Damn!

Brown checks a wristwatch on his other wrist. It’s 9:56.

BROWN
Damn!

At last, the PACKARD pulls up across the street from thetarped DeLorean. Martyjumps
out, dressed in his 1985 clothes.

BROWN
You’re late! Do you have no concept of time?

Brown pulls the tarp off the DeLorean and raisesthe “trolley hook“ on backto its full height.

MARTY
Take it easy, Doc! I had to change my clothes. Everything’s cool — they’re
back together...and here’s the proof.

Marty shows him thefully restored snapshot.

MARTY
Yeah, old George really came through. Laid out Biff with one punch — cold
cocked him... and I had to miss it. I never knew he had it in him. Hell, my old
man’s never stood up to Biff in his life.

Brown opens the DeLorean door.

BROWN
All right, let’s set your destinationtime. This is the exacttime you left...

INSERT — L.E.D. READOUT
On a readoutlabeled “Last Time of Departure“ is “OCTOBER 5, 1985, 1:11 AM.“

BROWN
punches the appropriate keypad.

BROWN
(continuing)
Let’s send you home 10 minutes later...

INSERT

The readout labeled “Destination Time“ lights upto read “OCTOBER 5, 1985, 1:21 AM.“
We can see that the two readouts differ by 10 minutes.

EXT. ON BROWN AND MARTY

BROWN

(continuing)
Ten minutes isn’t long enough for you to be missed. Now, I’ve painted a
white line on the street up there — that’s where you start from.

(continuing)
I’ve calculated the precise distance, taking into account the acceleration
speed and wind resistance retroactive from the moment the lightning will
strike...

He picks up a WIND-UP ALARM CLOCK.
BROWN
(continuing)

When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas.

Brown gives it a wind, then sets it on the DeLorean dashboard.

143

144

145

Brown looks around, then sighs.

BROWN
Well, I guess that’s everything.
Marty extends his hand.
MARTY
Doc, thanks for everything.
They shake hands.
BROWN

Thank YOU. I’ll see you in about 30 years.
Marty sighs, again thinking of Brown’s destiny and the letter.

MARTY
I... I hope so.

BROWN
Don’t worry. As long as you hit that wire with this hook, everything’ll be fine.

MARTY
Right...

Brown puts his hands in his pockets and withdraws the letter Marty put there. He looks at it
curiously. Marty turns away.

BROWN
What’s the meaning of this?
MARTY
You’ll find out in 30 years.
BROWN
It’s about the future, isn’t it? Information about the future?
MARTY
You’ll find out in 30 years.
BROWN

I warned you about this, kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

MARTY
You’ve gotta take that risk, Doc. Your life depends on it.

BROWN
(shakes his head)
No. I’m not going to accept the responsibility.

Brown tears up the envelope and shoves the pieces into the Packard ashtray.

MARTY
All right, Doc, in that case, I’lljust have to tellyou straight out—

But before Marty can get the words out, a TREMENDOUS GUST OF WIND comes up
accompanied by a loud CRACK! They turn: A TREE LIMB in the square has blown down
right on top of the cable between the clock tower and the first lamp post!

The paddle-plug attached to the lightning rod on the clock tower is yanked out, and the
cable drops down from the clock tower!

BROWN
Great Scott! Kid — find the end of that cable — I’ll throw the rope down to
you!

Brown grabs a big coil of rope and dashes into the courthouse.

Marty gulps. He takes a look at the fallen tree branch onthe cable, then goes hunting for
the end of it.

The wind is picking up, and the sound of THUNDER approaches.
INT. CLOCK TOWER STAIRS — NIGHT

Brown charges up the several flights of stairs like a madman!
EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE

Marty pulls inthe cable, hunting forthe end of it. At last he finds it. He looks up at the clock
tower.

EXT. ON THE CLOCK TOWER

A DOOR opens up, giving access to the ledge below the clock. BROWN steps out. His hair
blows wildlyin the wind, and lightning flashes in the distance. He looks up.

BROWN’S P.O.V. OF
the CONNECTING SOCKET, dangling on its cable between the “1“ and “2“ onthe huge
clock face. Its other end is attached to the lightning rod on thetower above.

BROWN
looks down.

BROWN’S P.O.V. OF
MARTY, 5 stories below, waving with the paddle plug in hand.

BROWN
tosses one end of the rope down. The coil unravels.

EXT. THE SQUARE
The rope drops to the ground.
Marty runs over, grabs it, and ties it to the paddle plug. He waves back to Brown.

BROWN
nods and starts pulling the rope with the cable back up.

INTERCUT WITH BROWN
who can barely hear him.

BROWN
What??

MARTY
The future! On the night I travel back in time, the terrorists show up and you
get—

BONG! It’s exactly 10:00 — and the CLOCK BELLS STRIKE TEN! Marty can’t be heard
over the sound!

Brown almost loses his balance with the huge bells tolling so close! He regains his footing,
then pulls the rope up the rest of the way. He’s got the paddle plug in hand.

Brown yells at Marty, but he can’t be heard over the bells. Brown gestures that he’s got the
cable and that Marty should go.

MARTY
hesitates, but Brown gestures adamantly. At last Marty nods and runs to the DeLorean.

BROWN

unties the rope from the end of the paddle plug and looks up at its socket mate dangling on
the clock face. He reaches up for it, but he can’t quite get it. He’ll have to move across the
ledge to get closer to it.

MARTY
climbs into the DeLorean and closes the gull wing door.

INT. DELOREAN

Marty turns the key inthe ignition and revs it up. He puts the car in gear.

EXT. STREET — TOWN SQUARE

The DeLorean takes off.

Brown looks down and sees the ’DeLorean heading down the street. Brown moves along
the ledge. He reaches up but he s still not close enough to grab the dangling socket.
Lightning and thunder move ever closer.

EXT. STREET

The DeLorean passes a hand-painted white line on the street — Brown has also painted

the words “START HERE“ for Marty’s benefit. Marty makes a U-turn and pulls up to it, like
a starting line.

The “minutes“ indicator on the “Destination Time“ begins counting backwards:

Brown, with the cable in his left hand, moves a little further along the ledge.

Suddenly, the ledge CRACKS and CRUMBLES beneath his feet! Brown drops the cable
and grabs onto the CLOCK HANDS to save himself! The cable drops onto his left foot!

Brown hangs precariously from the clock face like Harold Lloyd, wind blowing his hair, and
lightning, cracking in the sky!

Brown carefully moves his right foot toward the intact section of ledge while trying to keep
the cable balanced on his left foot.

His right foot moves closer... at last it finds safe footing. Brown takes a deep breath, then
hops over onto the ledge.

He kicks the cable up with his left foot and catches it in his hand.

He sighs relief. Everything is all right. He reaches up with his right hand and is able to grab
the dangling socket.

short!

BROWN
jerks the end of the cable, trying to free it from the limb.

Brown can’t free it. His face takes on intense determination, exaggerated bythe wind and
lightning. He gives the cable atremendous yank.

The cable jerks free from the tree — but THE PLUG AT THE OTHER END IS
WRENCHED OUT OF THE CONNECTING SOCKET ON THE LAMP POST!

BROWN reacts with horror. He now has a useless plug in his hand. Lightning cracks even
closer!

Brown rips open his radiation suit revealing a BULLET PROOF VEST.

BROWN
It’s the latest fashion in personal protection. It’ll stop a slug from an
elephant rifle at 30 yards.

MARTY
But how did you know?

Brown smiles, reaches into his pocketand pulls out the LETTER THAT MARTY WROTE
— SCOTCH TAPED TOGETHER! It’s yellow and brittle: 30 years old!

MARTY
(smiles, shaking his head)
After all that lecturing about screwing up future events and the space-time
continuum...

BROWN
(shrugs)
Yeah, well, I figured, what the hell.

We hear APPROACHING POLICE SIRENS. *

CUT TO:
EXT. MARTY’S HOUSE — NIGHT 223
The DeLorean pulls up to the darkened house.

The gull wing passenger door opens and Marty gets out. Brown is driving and Einstein
takes Marty’s seat. Marty turns to talk to Brown.

INTERCUT WITH BROWN IN THE DELOREAN

MARTY
So howfar ahead are you going?

BROWN
I figure I’ll take it slow at first.. .go about 30 years, just to get my feetwet;
then maybe see what’s shaking in the 22nd or 23rd century.

MARTY
Well... good luck. And if you geta chance, look me up. I’ll be... 47 years old.

BROWN
Iwill. Funny... I had to wait 30 years to catch up to you. Now you’ve gotta
wait 30 years to catch up to me. Ain’t life weird.

Brown gives him a wink. Marty closes the door.
EXT. MARTY’S HOUSE — NIGHT 224
Marty waves Brown off and headstoward his front door.

In the background, the DeLorean zooms off, and we see lig ht from the offscreen TIME
TRAVEL GLOW. Marty is hit by the sharp blast of wind.

CUT TO:
INT. MARTY’S BEDROOM — DAY 225

MARTY is on top ofthe bed, asleep in his clothes. Morning light streams in through the
bedroom window; he stirs and opens his eyes. He blinks several times, as if getting his
bearings, then sits up and looks around.

Yes, it’s his room all right, and everything seems the same, from the Z-28 posters to his
audio equipment.

Marty looks at the clock: 8:30. He looks at the wall calendar: the first four days of October
are X’ed off— today is the 5th. Could it have all been a dream?

He gets out of bed and looks at himself in the mirror, then pinches himself to make sure
he’s real. He is. On the nightstand is a framed 5 x 7 version of the snapshot with he and
his siblings. it looks the same.

He reaches into his waste can and pulls out the SUBMISSION FORM TO THE RECORD *
COMPANY. He looks at it, then decisively pulls the CASSETTE TAPE out of his drawer,
and puts it in the envelope with the form.

226

227

INT. BEDROOM CORRIDOR — DAY 226

MARTY comes out of his room with the envelope. He goes down the hall and stops short
as he enters

INT. DINING ROOM — DAY 227

LINDA and DAVE are seated at the dining room table which has been beautifully set for
breakfast. The 5 table settings are elegant; Dave is eating a half of grapefruit; Linda has
eggs benedict. Dave is wearing an expensive tailored suit and reads the business section
of the morning paper.

MARTY
Say, are we having company or something?

LINDA
Not that I know of.

MARTY
Dave, aren’t you working today?

DAVE
Sure, I always work on Saturday.

MARTY
Then what’s with the fancy suit?

DAVE

(confused, doesn’t understand)
Marty, are you all right?

MARTY
Yeah. Are YOU guys all right?
DAVE
Sure, never better. Here, let me take that— I’ll mail it from the office.

Dave takes Marty’s envelope.

Marty nods uneasily and takes his place at the table. A bowl of fresh strawberries is waiting
for him.

Now GEORGE and LORRAINE enter from outside. They’re tanned and healthy in TENNIS
OUTFITS with tennis rackets. George carries himself with an air of confidence, and
Lorraine looks terrific — thin and svelte, radiantly healthy and positive. This is a happy
marriage.

Marty can’t believe how good his mother looks.

MARTY
Mom! You look — great!!

LORRAINE
Why, thank you, Marty. Say, tonight’s the big night, right? Your big date with
Suzy Parker? Such a nice girl, I sure like her.

228

229

MARTY
(can’t believe it‘s his mother talking)
Pardon me, Ma?

LORRAINE
You’re going up to the lake tonight, aren’t you? Haven’t you been planning
it for 2 weeks?

MARTY
Mom, we went through this last night. How can I go if Dad’s car is wrecked?

GEORGE
Wrecked? There’s nothing wrong with my car. In fact, Biff is out there
waxing it right now.

|NT./EXT. MCFLY KITCHEN — P.O.V — DAY 228

George opens the curtains, revealing BIFF waxing a new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL in the
driveway. Biff is working diligently; his rough edges and arrogance are all gone.

George opens the window.

GEORGE
Hey, Biff, don’t forget to wax the inside of the wheel covers. You forgot that
last time.

BIFF
(friendly, eagerto please)
Yes, sir, you’re the boss, sir!

Marty is absolutely astonished. 229

GEORGE
(sitting back down)
Some employees will get away with murder if you don’t stay on ‘em. I’ve
had to keep him in line ever since high school. Although if it wasn’t for him,
your mother and I would have never met.

LINDA
Yeah, Dad, you’ve told us a million times: you beat him up when he was
bothering Mom and that’s how the two of you fell in love.

LORRAINE
It was more than that. Your fatherliterally came to my rescue. (sighs) It was
so romantic!

LINDA
(rolls her eyes)
Cornball city.

Marty nods with complete understanding.

GEORGE
(calls into the kitchen)
Bertha, how about bringing Marty his French Toast?

230

231

232

A uniformed MAID ENTERS with a tray and sets a lovely plate of French Toast in front of
Marty. Marty is too dumbfounded to speak.

GEORGE
Well, Bertha, you won’t have to put up with that tiny kitchen much longer.

BERTHA
When will the new house be ready, sir?

GEORGE
Just as soon as they finish painting the tennis court and re-tiling the
swimming pool. It’ll be sad to leave this place, though. So many memories...
of you kids, and of my days as a struggling writer.

BIFF ENTERS and hands George a HARDBACK BOOK.

BIFF
Oh, Mr. McFly, thisjust came in: It’s the British edition of your current best
seller. How many has it sold so far? A million?

INSERT — BOOK 230
It’s called “A MATCH MADE IN SPACE,“ and the cover shows a bedroom with a space

alien talking to a couple in bed — very reminiscent of Marty’s “Darth Vader“ visitation to

George. The style indicates it’s a science-fiction romance novel. The author’s name,

GEORGE MCFLY, is in big letters.

BACK TO SHOT 231

GEORGE
Two million, hard cover.

BIFF
Oh, Marty — here’s your keys. Your car is all waxed and ready for tonight.

Biff tosses him a set of keys.

MARTY
My car?
CUT TO:
EXT. MCFLY HOUSE — DAY 232
Marty comes out ofthe house and opens the garage door, revealing
A TRICKED OUT BLACK SUPRA, just like he saw in the showroom. *
MARTY can’t believe it. The personalized license plate says “MARTY I.“ *

Marty approaches his new car.

VOICE (0.8.)
How abouta ride, mister?

Marty turns — it’s SUZY PARKER. She looks just the same: great.

233

234

235

MARTY
Suzy! Are you ever a sight for sore eyes! Let me look at you!

Marty looks at her, as iftrying to make sure she’s real. Suzy is hard-pressed to understand
why Marty is making such a big deal aboutthis.

SUZY
Marty, are you okay? You’re acting like you haven’t seen me in a week.

MARTY
I haven’t.

He pulls hertoward him... they’re about to kiss... closer, closer...

And just as they kiss, their HAIR STANDS UP ON END. Marty’s eyes widen with the
inevitable expectation...

MARTY
Oh, no... not again...

We hear a SONIC BOOM, and Marty turns —the DELOREAN STREAKS UP in front of the 233
house.

DR. BROWN 234
jumps out, more wild-eyed and frantic than we’ve ever seen him. His clothes are

particularly bizarre — a weird mixture of past and future: a cowboy hat, a strange variation

on a Roman tunic, a cape, and striped plastic pants.

BROWN

Marty — you’ve gotta come with me — back to the future!
MARTY

Doc, I’ve got Suzy here. I wasjust gonna try out my newwheels.
BROWN

Well, bring her along —this concerns her, too. *

Brown opens the passenger gull wing door for him. Marty and Suzy approach cautiously. *

MARTY

What do you mean? What happens? *

(sudden alarm)

Does something happen to us? Do we turn into assholes or something? *

BROWN

No, you and Suzy both turn out fine. But your kids, Marty — something’s
gotta be done about your kids!

Brown gets back in the DeLorean.

INT. DELOREAN 235
Marty gets in, and Suzy sits on his lap. She closes the door. *

BROWN
Okay, here we go...

236

MARTY
You’d better back this thing up, Doc. We haven’t got enough road to get up
to 88.

BROWN
Where we’re going, we don’t use roads.

Brown hits a new switch on the dashboard: “WESTINGHOUSE FUSION ENERGIZER.“

EXT. STREET 236
The DeLorean speeds down the street, then BLASTS OFF INTO THE SKY LIKE A *
STREAK!

Once again, the coils glow and the DeLorean is enveloped in the familiar white glow and
disappears into the future...

ROLL END TITLES

FADE OUT
