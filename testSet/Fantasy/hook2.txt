PRINCESS TI (DC)
We come to celebrate the great Pan's
return. To make peace between our
tribes. And join as one in the "Never
War" against the black Hook---

THE LOST BOYS sit in a row on a palm log. Long faces,
elbOWs on knees, chins at half-mast. They face PRINCESS T1,
the sculpted MALAYSIAN and 4 WARRIORS, dressed in war gear.

.PRINCESS TI

(continuing)
--but I heard it through the grapevine...
Pan is dead....nad timing.

Princess Ti and her delegation stand. She breaks a spear in
half with her bare hands and hurls it to the ground.

PRINCESS TI
No Pan. No truce. We catch you in our
territory--we rip out your hearts.

Princess Ti leads her delegation disappearing silently into
the forest. Rufio waits until they’re cut of sight-—then—-

RUFIO
Whoa—-c'm back, Skins. Yo wanna fight?

ACE holds Rufio back, who isn't about to fight.

Lost Boys sit in total defeat. ZIGGY tries to comfort TINK.
She's an emotional mess crying her eyes out.

TINK
I did this to him. I hauled his cookies
back here. Now...he's gone...

ZIGGY. ~
Id's okay, Tink. Nobody blames you. I
jusd wish I’d been nicer to'im when I
med'im.

RUFIO
Fightin' Hook was always a stupid idea.
Bildin' this boat was a stupid idea.
(spits on the hull)
Waitin' for du great Peter Pan ta
lead us was a stupid idea.

ZIGGY
Whuddaboud Peter's kids? In 3 dayze,
Hooky's gonna kill’em.

ACE

ﬁg have :9 save th m. They can live
here-~with us. And the others--the

galley slaves? Pan or no Pan, I say
we attack.

Rufio bats ACE about the head.

RUFIO
You crazy, dumb, Mon? Yo wanna to
git usselves killed?

TINK blurs right up to Rufio’s face, turning volcanic red,
cursing him in faerie-speak. We don’t need a translation.

-RUFIO
Get oudda my face faerie--
(whipping out his knife)

» TINK
I’M SAYING YOU’RE RIGHT!

Rufio double-takes Tink. He doesn't believe his ears.

TINK
,Rufio's right. Without the Indians—-
we don't have a chance against Hook.
Princess Ti will only follow the one

true Pete; Ban... _
Everybody lets down. Dejected sighs.

PETER (O.C.)
HULLOOOO!

All heads turn-- ,

EXT. KIDD COVE ->'SUNSET

An amazing sight. Like a-float in the Rose Parade by
Maxfield Parrish. A raft of giant clam shells, adorned with
Mermaids--tropical flowers--towed by a team of Dolphins.
THE RAFT - CLOSER

PETER! Standing at the helm flanked by Una, Babs and
Angelika. Hands on his hips in familiar pose. Still 35--but
a more youthful aura about him. His clothes have slowly
changed to a Polo/Robinson Crusoe look. '
Ziggy leads the boys down the beach to meet him.

ZIGGY
Id's Peder! He came back.

 

 

05/21/90 61

Peter jumps ashore and waves goodbye. Dolphins pull the
raft away. Mermaids wave, chattering their sea sounds--

ANGELIKA/UNA/BABS
Goodbye Peter--We love you, Peter!

The Boys surround him, genuinely glad to see him.

Tink can’t fight it, she flits to him and packs his cheek
with her little faerie lips turning all shades of the
rainbow. Peter touches the spot, embarassed.

TINK
Oh, Peter-—you're alive. I'm so---
(catching herself, she huffs up)
What're you doing with the Aquatic
Bimbos....

PETER
They saved me, Tink.

TINK
(incredibly jealous)
I’ll just bet. Did you tell them you're
married? Hmm? Did you? Huh? Forget
rto mention your Kids? Uh—hunh.

PETER
Tink-—will you listen? They saved me.
That's all-—--

A hunting horn BLEATS O. C...Everyone cringes. The Boys
part. ZIGGY appears from his hut, blowing his ram’ s horn,
dragging a long sword behind.

ZIGGY
I found it' Look! Id's yours.

Ziggy hoists the blade reverently to him. Peter holds it
awkwardly--turning it, weighing it, a kid with a new toy.

RUFIO
Who gives a sheet, Mon? Whot can you
do with Grandpa in 3 days? Who youse
gonna call?

Rufio cackles, grabbing his crotch, jock style at Peter.

- PETER
(vowing) ’
I'll do anything to save my kids.

If I have to fly--I_ll fly. If I
have to fight--1_ll fight.

BOYS CHEER, beating their weapons, howling, dancing around
Peter and Tink.

Peter dramatically JERKS the heavy sword from the
sheath--the sheath goes flying-—nearly hitting Rufio,
razzing on the sloop. V

CUT TO:
INT. HOOK'S GREAT CABIN - NIGHT ‘
HOOK SITS alone at the table head, completely depressed.

HOOK
My life...is over.....

SMEE tends trying to cheer the Captain up with a lavishly
spread dinner. Fine linen. Sparkling crystal. Solid gold
cutlery. Cuisine fit for a 4-star King. Smee tucks his

napkin in for him, decanting the wine--He props a golden

-fork in Hook's hand and fastens a knife to his hook.

. HOOK
Why did I listen to that scheming
Pixie? Pan’s not Coming back. She
'can't change him in 3 days or 3
decades. There's up; going to be

any war....
(big sigh of self pity)

Cheated from my own destiny by
a.....chicken.

‘ SMEE .
Aye, Cap' n, "chicken". "Cog Au Vin".
,Just like your Mum made it.

Book regards the steaming _bird before him. With courtly
manners, he splays the dressed drumlegs, rips off the
little booties--and buries his hook deep in it's groin
—-gouging and ripping and disemboweling the carcass with a
vengeance until nothing is left but....grease...

HOOK ,

My gum gent mg :9 ﬁoardigg gghggl.
(a little sigh)

I D .The bitch. C I I

Smee eyes CECCO, the handsome Italian, standing guard with\

Jukes. Big trouble. They back slowly away seeking cover.

HOOK
Do you know what I hate, Smee--I mean
nggg?--I really hate looking

really
forward to something--§_g Planning--

06/21/90 63

Hook rearranges the table--

HOOK
(continuing)

--the anticipation--
(blinks his eyes in anticipation)

the excitement--
(big wide gasp--eyes wide)

He explodes raking the table with his claw--

HOOK
--JUST TO BE DISAPPOINTED! I HATE
BEING DISAPPOINTED! I HATE NEVER
LAND! AND I HATE PETER PANNNN!

Hook grabs a diamond studded dueling pistol from his sash--

HOOK
MY LIFE IS OVERRRRR!

--and shoves the barrel in his mouth.

SMEE
CAP’NNN!

HOOK PULLS the trigger. SMEE LUNGES, jamming his pointy
finger in the hammerlock as it snaps shut. Smee yells. Hook
yells--prying Smee’s finger lose--he jams the barrel on his
nose. Smee grabs the gun with his hands. Hook and Smee wave
the gun around the Great Cabin--

HOOK
I just want to...dieeee!

»SMEE
That's not the answer, Cap'n!

CECCO AND JIKES can't escape the line of fire. Every place
they bob and weave and crash and hide, Hook finds them.

HOOK AND SMEE PANCAKE the table. Food flies. The gun FIRES!

THE COOK wheeling in the dessert cart drops dead in a pile
of pastry. A gaping bullet hole in his heart-—

HOOK
(even more suicidal)
Look what you've made me do! Who's
'going to make me creme broule' now?
I can't go on like this. 59 dessertl?
(shoves another pistol in his mouth)

06/21/90 64

SMEE
. (sincere, devoted)
Aww, now--what kind of world would
it be without Captain Hook? Aye?

Deeply moved, Hook pulls the gun from his mouth--pondering
the question before him.

HOOK
Good form, Smee. What would the
world be without Capt. Hook?

The eternal question. He clutches Smee in an endearing
hug—-unaware he's clawing Smee's back. Suddenly paranoid,
listening, he releases Smee--who' s in severe pain.

HOOK
What's that ticking?

He slashes his drapes with his sword--slicing Cecco--

, HOOK
Where is it? Tick-tick-tick. There!
Over here! Hah! Hake it stop! SHEEE!

Hook crawls on hands and knees frantic, looking under the
table. He's up inspecting the food, running his swerd out a
series of portholes, slashing his chaise--

SMEE
There is pg ticking, gaan. You
kilt that Croc years ago. We threw
all the clocks overboard--remember?

Hook grabs an hour glass-~listening to see if it’s ticking.
He smaShes it. "Hooking"- Smee under the collar, he lifts
the bulbous man in the air.

HOOK
(ever so polite)
Are you saying-~there is no ticking
in this room?-Hmmm? That I-am, shall
we say. mentallx unstable because I
hear ticking and you do not? Is that
your gist, Hr. Smee?

Smee motions frantically to Cecco--who is sitting on the
floor near faint from his sword wound.

_ HOOK
Do you know what I really hate?
(putting the gun to Smee's head)
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HEAR TICKING WHEN
I HEAR TICKING. IT TICKS ME OFFFFF!

 

06/21/90

65

Smee ticks his hand back and forth at Jukes. Finally--

JUKES/CECCO
"tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock"

Hook abruptly drops Smee--listening as if hearing angels.

HOOK,
There...See? "Ticking".

SMEE
(pouring him a drink)
Cap'n, me thinks you need a little
somethin' to take yer mind off this
Pan business. Let's go ashore'n kill
some Indians. 12h hate Indians, £99.

HOOK
(whining like a spoiled kid)
We always kill Indians. I don't want
to kill Indians. 1 want :9 _ill Enn.

Hook curls up in a fetal ball on the baywindow seat.

SMEE
Don't torture yersef, Cap’n. Y'can't
let the men see you this way.

HOOK
(curling inva tighter ball)
I don't care. It's all I've been
living for. This little boy of youth
and joy-fall goody and sweet. And I,
JaS- HOOR--I teuld cut the eeneeited

.arrogant pee; like a pig and feed his

adolescent entrails to the bilge rats.

' (punctuating with mimed sword)
What fun....

(he wells up)

What's the use? What's the point?
He's taken all the joy out of it. He's
not worth killing. Pan's done it
again...Peter the Schlub beat me. Why
eenit I .13 iteto _nse? Ie th_t too
mesh L9 §§K?

‘SMEE -
Lookit‘the bright side, Capn', if'in
Pan doesn't show--you still git to deep
6 his ruddy rotten curtain crawlers.

 

06/21/90 ‘ ' 66

HOOK
(brightens then delfates, morose)
Kill Pan’s kids?--That would be....
"bad form". But a deal is a deal. And
Jas. Hook is a man of his word.

SMEE
Cap’n--there is another way. You don’t
have to kill'em--ef'en they sign the
blood oath and join your crew-—

Hook thinks about it. Devious. But "nayyyyyy".

SMEE
Wait--better. Yes, a thousand times
b1acker—-Make the little morons love you--

HOOK '
It's Pan they love. Even you, Smee,

are lovable. Np little ghildgen lgyg mg.

Crushed with rejection, Hook grabs his second pistol and
shoves it in his mouth again. Smee pulls it out--

SMEE
-That's the point, Cap'n! The ultimate
! Pan's kids in love with Hook!
The ultimate "pay back", Cap'n.

Hook relaxes his trigger finger, piqued.

SMEE
Can you 'magine the look on Peter's
puss when he faces you end his kids
standing right beside you! Ready to
fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the
seas....Cap'n Hook!

HOOK .
(caught up) '
I like it. It has a certain symmetry.

SMEE
You'd make a fine father, Cap’n, if
I do say so, mesef.

We are horrified. Hook is horrified. Then intrigued. Then
enamored. Hook begins to laugh at the notion, almost giddy.
escalating to hysterical. Smee joins in. Then Cecco and
Jukes roaring with uncontrollable laughter.

HOOK
"Captain Hook--and Family!“ "The
Family Hook!" Captain Hook-~Family Han!"

 

 

 

 

06/21/90 67

TIGHT ON CAPTAIN HOOK
He subsides. A serene smile on his face.

HOOK .
The Hooks...A family...to love...

Hook sucks slowly on the barrel like nursing Mum's breast.

CUT TO:
INT. SHIP’S HOLD - NIGHT - TIGHT ON CHAINS

RATS follow the chains across barefeet. Maggie and Jack
huddle, chained to their oars. She SCREAMS. Jack kicks at
the ugly things. A HAND snatches a big Rat on Maggie's leg.

The YOUNG SLAVE chained next to her dangles the squealing
vermin by it's tail. He smiles, showing his rotty teeth.

YOUNG SLAVE
The big ones always go for the
freshies like youse two.

Maggie buries her head against Jack.

MAGGIE
I want to see Mommy. Daddy won't
forget us---will he?

JACK

' The kid can't be more than 12. He whams the rat by the tail
against the floor until it's dead. He offers it.

YOUNG SLAVE
You can have firsties.

Maggie gags. Jack holds her close trying to make it go
away. It won't.

Sleeping. A Ram's horn enters frame next to his ear.
BAROOMPH! Ziggy blows hard. Peter jerks awake, bonking his
head on Tink's little house hanging above.

ZIGGY
Move it! You got 2 minutes! Go! Go!

Ziggy drops down a rope-slide 30 feet to the ground.

TINK EHERGES from her little house, stretching, yawning
from a bad night. Her hair looks like the Bride of
Frankenstein: No sparkle. Eyes bloodshot.

Peter looks askance. He's never seen her like this befOre.

TINK
(major morning grouch)
What're you looking at. You don’t
look so hot in the morning either.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOST BOY CAMP - MORNING

Lost Boys load a giant slingbow onto the Avenger. Lots of
activity can be seen all over the ship.

ZIGGY

Marches back and forth dragging Peter's long sword in the
dirt, tripping at each about-face. Peter sits on a log
trying to take the little guy seriously.

EXT. CAMP - LATER
LOST BOYS load large rocks onboard the ship.
BY THE TREEHOUSE
Rufio readies "engarde" with Peter's sword.

RUFIO
I'm only doin' this one time--watch.

ACE and Ziggy hurl continuous coconuts at him.

IN A BLUR, Rufio slices and cracks each coconut skewering
the last on the tip of the blade--chugging the fresh milk.

 

 

06/21/90 71

Peter, overwhelmed, looks at Tink, now her feisty beautiful
self, watching from underneath a sunflower umbrella, doing
her toes. She’s all smiles. "Piece of cake".

RUFIO
Your turn, Grandpa.

Rufio holds out the sword. Peter reaches for it. Rufio
drops it in the dirt, passing by Tink who sneers at him.

Peter holds the heavy sword in both hands. Nervous. Rufio
juggles 3 coconuts pitching them at him.

Peter'doesn't even getfclose with the sword. 3 direct hits
to his head. BONK. BINK. KERPLOPADA.

Tink hangs her little head. Long day.

Peter stands on a mound overlooking the Camp and Cove.
Nervous, nodding, shaking out his arms.

PETER
Swimming. Okay. Got it:

ZIGGY, ACE and the other boys wait at the other end of the
clearing. ACE has a "spyglass" for tracking.

HIGH IN HIS TREE — RUFIO WATCHES
Reclining on his hammock. ‘
TINK goes over a little "pre-flight" checklist
TINK

Peter grabs her wings shaking glowing dust all over him.

PETER

TINK
Happy thought?

Peter. Blank look. Then a lecherous grin. He closes his
eyes and runs--f1apping his arms--

PETER
Angelika! Una! B-B-Babs! Oo-Oo—ahh—-

PETER LEAPS AND CRASHES to the ground--right in front of
the Lost Boys. They laugh and jeer.

Ziggy marks Peter’s landing with an "x" in the dirt--
ZIGGY

(trying to stay positive)
Altitude--2 feet. Distance-—2 feet.

RUFIO hoots hysterical heaving his half-eaten mango.

RUFIO

PETER

He CRASHES HARD, skidding into a bamboo water f1ume--
collapsing the entire structure-~drenching himself.

quill and ink and paper.

MAGGIE

Hook smiles, tracing his claw down her cheek.

HOOK

Jack pulls Maggie to him, motioning her to be quiet.

HOOK
A wise young man. If you don't fail

the exam--ygn don't Qi_.

He smashes his ruler down hard on the desk, startling both
children.

HOOK
First question. What do parents really
mean when they say "I love you"?

Maggie raises her hand, begging to be called on.

MAGGIE
I know--I know--

 

06/21/90 74

Jack wants no part of this, pulling Maggie's hand down. She
insists. Hook scans the room as if it were full.

HOOK

The cute little urchin in the front row.

HAGGIE
They mean we make them really really
really really happy all the time.

' HOOK
(slamming his ruler)

Maggie recoils, near tears. Jack is riveted.

Maggie is crying by the end of Hook's tyrade. Hook leans,
daubing her eyes. He smiles politely right in Jack's face.

HOOK
Ring a bell....Jack?

And now--the dreaded "pop quiz".

Hook flips the chalk board over, reading the one lone
question aloud.

"Do my parents love me?...A, yes....
B, no...."

(passing out paper)
Remember, your future depends on it.
You may begin.

Hook turns.over a large hourglass.

Maggie instantly marks her test paper "A" and turns it
over. She looks to Jack--

He’s vapor locked, staring at his paper, completely
stumped. Sweating, ringing his hands in anguish.

Maggie elbows him hard. "Jack....?"

Hook is delighted with the progress.

Ziggy shows him how to wipe his hands on his shirt and his
mouth on the back of his sleeve like a third base coach
giving the "hit and run".

Peter tries it. A tentative wipe. The Boys cheer.

Tink applauds from her seat at the head of the roast pig in

Peter guts it up, opening his showing them back.
ACE lets out the world's longest belch.

Ziggy starts the cacaphony of BELCHES around the table.
Long, short, juicy, terminal. All eyes turn to Peter.

He laughs uncontrollably.

PETER
Stop it--Enough!--Hey!--STOP IT!

Peter grabs Zig, Shaving him away with his foot. He

pitched on the deck. The "Long Tom" cannon smoking on one
side of him, a lavish spread of food on the other.

SLAVE BOYS reload "Long Tom".

.JACK AND MAGGIE appear from the hold escorted by Jukes.
They react to the bright sun like little Vampires. 1

SMEE bounds up-and bows low. 1

SMEE 1
And 'ow would you like to see 1
a real live Mermaid, Miss Maggie?

MAGGIE
I don't like you. My Mo my showed me
where to kick mean men like you and run.

 

Smee guards himself taking her firmly by the shoulder. He
escorts her away. Jack doesn't like it.

HOOK (OC)
Jack--my boy.

Hook beckons from his tent lighting his twin cigars, boots
propped on the cannon.

"JACK
Where's he taking my sister?

HOOK
Come aboard. Come aboard. We’ll
discuss it, like..."Men". Breathe
that sea air.

(breathes deep, exalting)
Hungry? Have some breakfast. I'm
trying out a new chef. I'm very
interested in your opinion.

Jack gapes at the huge spread of nothing but desserts.
HOOK ‘

PUSH IN ON JACK: Torn. He shakes his head reluctantly "no".

HOOK
(pats the cannon fondly)
"Long Tom"'s just a big toy, Jack. The
truth be known, I'm just a big kid at
heart...I just have bigger toys.
And like all-children...I have a
natural born talent for..gestructien.

He touches off the cannon again. It ROARS!
EXT. PIRATE TOWN - CONTINUING ACTION

A direct hit on a building. Raining brick and timber
everywhere.

RESUME: HOOK
Placing his arm around Jack's shoulder, admiring his aim.

HOOK
The best part--nobody is going to
EEK: YO“ clean BE Lb: HESS-

JACK
(backs away, resisting)
I'm not allowed to play with guns.

HOOK
Not allowed? NOT ALLOWED? Who said?
Sounds like sOme adult who doesn't
trust you. A Daddy who broke promises.
Someone who says they love you...but
is never there when you need them most.....

Hook has pushed the button on Jack's pent up anger.

. HOOK
Now if I were 10 or 11, and someone
gave me a cannon to play with--—
Well....who knows...

Hook hands Jack a lit cigar, bows and leaves. Jack stares
at the cigar--he takes a taboo drag--feeling his power.

FOLLOW HOOK
Up the stairs to his great cabin. KABOOM! The Cannon roars
in the f.g. Hook stops, savoring the moment. He does a
little "Bojangles" tap up the steps and enters his cabin.

HOOK (v0)
Good form.

PETER sets "en garde". He’s ready. He blurs through a
series of parries, slashes and thrusts. Wow!

ACE and Ziggy give the "thumbs up" to Tink.

ZIGGY
Looking good.

RUFIO WINDS UP, indicating "curve ball". He delivers.

PETER CUTS a swathe--missing. The coconut knocks him to the
ground. Faces fall.

-ZIGGY pitches a coconut UNDERHANDED to Peter. He swings! He

misses! The sword goes SAILING--

TINK DUCKS! The sword just misses her. She curses in
faerie-speak, kicking over her umbrella.

The Lost Boys line the ridge, holding their collective

TINK .
You're going to fly today even if I

you. From the top. "Birthdays".

Peter, exhausted and battered, grimaces. "Again"?

1 PETER
Birthdays... ’

Closing his eyes, he starts to run flapping again.-

PETER
Presents! Yes! More presents!

He jumps getting airborne-—feet pedaling air. Up! Up!
This is it! Yes!

PETER

Another year older. Getting older—-
Dead! Dying! I hate birthdays...

JACK
I’m not supposed to eat sweets
before breakfast.

HOOK
This ie breakfast, Jack. ‘
(holding one in Jack's face)
Besides...who'e going to stop you?

Jack’s starving. He woofs down an eclair--devouring a
Napoleon. Hook smiles, turning back to the view.

Jack hesitates. He reaches out-—taking Hook's sword hanging
on the chair-~he lunges-~chopping at Hook’s black mane--

Hook's right arm BLURs--CLANG!-—blocking the blow against
his CLEANING HOOK without even looking. He wrenches the
blade away from Jack.

HOOK
(long sardonic smile)
Jack..Jack...Jack...fine name, "Jack".
How about "Red-Jack"? Has a ring to it--
(rings a goblet with his hook)
Smoke?

Opening his humidor--puffing perfect smoke rings.

JACK ,
(why didn't Hook kill me?)
I don’t smoke.

_ HOOK
Good.form. Shows strength of charac-
ter. I have none of course. There
are some advantages to this disgusting
habit that balance the dangers---

He languidly droops his twin cigar ashes over the fire port
on Long Tom. The fuse hisses.

The CANNON FIRES belching fire and smoke between them. Jack
covers his ears ducking away.

Rufio turns leading the Lost Boys away one by one. Only
Ziggy remains on the ridge with Tink.

WITH PETER - IN THE BOG
He gets up, slinging mud.

PETER
That’s it! I quit!

Ziggy and Tink rush up.

PETER
I can't think like a kid--I can't act
like a kid because I’m not a kid.

He pushes by railing at everything and everyone.

PETER

I can’t fight and I CAN'T FLY! Tootles
'was right. You grow up, you stop
believing, you find out life sucks--
and then you die.

(g rim silence, he subsides)
We'll just have to find some other
way..lto get Maggie and Jack...

TINK
There is n. 9t_er Es!._2etet!

Tink stews in one direction. Peter in another. He trips
over a log right in the mud. Ziggy helps him up.

They sit on the log. Peter broOds. Ziggy removes a leather
pouch from around his neck, weighing it like precious gems.

ZIGGY
Peder, I’membur Toodles. He wuz one
'of us. Lookit. Theez are his marbuls.
Theez are his happy thoughds. He lefd
them behind. They dond work for me...
Maybe they wull fur you....

He dumps the marbles in Peter's hand. Non-descript.

PETER
They're just marbles, Ziggy.

ZIGGY
Wull, whad happened to Toodles?

TINK LIGHTS on Peter' 5 hand, checking out the marbles like
a diamond merchant.

 

06/21/90 83

TINK
Wendy took him back with the others—-
to grow up and go to school--and go to
an office--and be a gentleman.

, PETER
"Poor kind Tootles." He didn't make
a very good grown-up.

ZIGGY
(welling up)
Toodles god old? Heez gonna die? Don'd
led Toodles die. Give him back theez.

' It hits Tink. Staring at her distorted reflection in a big

Cat's Eye marble.

TINK
Ziggy--you've got to do this. Get the
Boys and go to Princess Ti. Beg a truce.

ZIGGY
Whad? She'll barbecue our budds.

TINK

She blurs away leaving Peter and Ziggy at a loss--

ZIGGY
Beddur do whad she sez. She gedz

Zig waddles off in the other direction.

PETER

Peter limps after her--all aches and pains.
CUT TO:
EXT. DENSE SILVERY WOOD - LATE AFTERNOON

The sun’s rays barely penetrate the dense forest. Peter
climbs over a huge felled tree. Tink's aura twinkles ahead.

PETER

I'll kill her. I swear I will.
(stops in awe at the sight ahead)

 

 

06/21/90 ’ 34

PAN UP THE GIANT "NEVER TREE"

A sprawling ancient sentinel. Burned and charred, but
refusing to fall. Limbs, trunk and branches twist and turn

100 feet into the sunset sky.

PETER
I know this place....

Peter approaches the monument. Drawn to it by a powerful
force. He traces the charred bark reverently with his hand.
A stray ray of sunlight illuminates the trunk before him.
Something is carved on it. He brushes away the soot and ash
with building anticipation--

Letters.take shape in the trunk. Names. Carved like ancient
Rhunes—--Peter rejoices with each revelation!

Tracing her name--with manly tears of lost youth and days
that will never be again. ~

The light on the carvings grows and spreads. Peter looks up
shading his eyes from the glare.

HIS POV - THE GIANT TREE

‘Filled‘with a 1,000 beams of intense twinkling lights

descending toward him. The air alive with chiming voices.

FAERIES and PIXIES and NYMPHS and SYLPHS of all ages and
species descend to him--buzzing in close for a good look,
then darting away--speaking their singsong language.

TINK LIGHTS on his outstretched hand. She is regal. Wearing
a magnificent crown and flowing gown fit for a queen. She
bows low with all the poise of a great ruler.

Peter, compelled, bows his head in return.

PETER
Tink....you're....beautiful.

 

 

06/21/90 85

TINK
(blushing) .
Oh puhleeze. Do you like the dress?

She does a full turn. Peter nods like a big kid--the grown
man part can’t take his eyes off her. ‘

TINK
(These are my kind, Peter. I am their
Queen. They came to help....

Faeries whizz and buzz about him. A little one pulls his
hair. Another plops on his nose sizing him up. Peter
chuckles, making faces, completely at ease and enchanted.

PETER
Help me?

FAERIES PULL AND TUG him like a big puppet into the trunk
of the giant tree. The entire tree glows from within.

INT. UNDERGROUND HIDEOUT - LIMBO

Peter descends in a rickety wicker basket contraption into
a black void.

FAERIES STREAM DOWN from above following Tink lighting up a
cavernous room.

REVEAL: THE FAMED SECRET UNDERGROUND HIDEOUT

Where Wendy played Mother to Peter and the Lost Boys. A
huge-walkin fireplace dominates one end of the vast room.
The remains of beds the other. A smashed rocking chair.
Everything is charred from a great fire. Mushrooms abound.

Peter is stunned, elated and saddened as he touches down.

~ TINK
Do you know where you are?

, PETER
(nodding sadly)
What...happened?

TINK.
Hook burned it when you didn't cOme back.

Peter sadly rummages the ruins of a kid—sized red
playhouse. It's burned and chopped to pieces.

PETER ‘ .
Wendy's house. Tootles and Nibs built
it for her. I remember. I remember.

 

J

06/21/90 86

Emotions and memories flood in.

In the fireplace, he discovers his "Pan" flute. He savors
it, attempting a few notes. He gets mouth full of soot.

_ PETER
I need music lessons too, Tink.

He pitches the flute, angry remorse.

PETER
Why did you bring me here? There's
nothing here....but...ee§ thinge.
(kicking around)
This is not working, Tink. Let's
get out of here.

TINK
There's no place else to go, Peter.
You were happy here once upon a time.

PETER
It's gone. It's all gone. Everything.

He kicks at the charred remains of his youth. Something
catches his attention. He picks up a Teddy Bear. Charred.

- One eye missing.

PETER
"Taddy"...aw Taddy. My "Mother" put
Teddy in my pram...to keep me company.

TINK
What else? Tell me...

PETER
I remember my Mother--and my Father
looking down at me--talking about how
I would grow up, and go to a fine school,
and be smart and learn things-~then
go off to an office and be an impor—
tant businessman. And then fall in
love, get married...and raise a
family...and be happy...

, TINK
Isn't that what all Grown-ups want
fOr their children?
The truth...

PETER
Yeah...it is.....

 

 

J

06/21/90 87

Peter is overwhelmed with the realization.

PETER
But I was afraid. I ran away from 2
people who loved me--because I didn't
want to grow up.....and die.

TINK
You’re only...human...

PETER
That's what I've been trying to tell
you...I never even told them I loved

1them...
Peter hits bottom. Complete remorse.

TINK
But you went back, Peter. You left
here and went back. What made you stop
being afraid to grow up and...die?

. PETER
I DON’T KNOW! I CAN'T REMEMBER!

Breaking point. He hurls Taddy into the void--
TADDY RISES

Turning in dream—like motion--FAERIES swarm around it,
catching it. They float the bear slowly back toward Peter.

TIGHT ON PETER - WATCHING THE VISION

Something snaps inside him. A memory. He reaches up. Taddy
lands gently into his outstretched hands--

TINKS MOVES IN

TINK
What, Peter? What is it?

TIGHT ON PETER - HE BLINKS: A LIFE FLASH - 1902

AT THE WAR COUNCIL RING

Peter sits with Ti. Ziggy and ACE on his side, 2 huge
Warriors on Ti's. Peter points with his sword around a
battle map drawn in the sand. We see the island.

Ziggy guides Hook’s ship. Ti motions. The Warriors push
sticks from their position to cut Hook off.

ACE surprises Hook with the Dark Avenger amidships. Peter
arcs a little Pan doll in a circular flight plan sneaking
up behind. ‘

Suddenly, SAND KICKS IN ruining the battle map.
RUFIO kicks sticks and ships away with a vengeance.

Peter ducks. His hand instinctively BLURS with his sword
SKEWERING THE COCONUT perfectly--

Rufio glares in disbelief. So does Peter. Rufio madly hurls
another and another--

Peter whirls-—parrying and slicing them cleanly in two.
Coconut pieces land in front of Ziggy. He's amazed.

RUFIO

Ti backs everyone up giving them room. She digs the action.

Rufio attacks. Peter's hand instinctively blocks and
counters every blow. Rufio backs off amazed.

Peter shrugs at Ziggy. "What"? Zig shrugs back, loving it.

ZIGGY
Yur Pan, man. A natural.

Rufio attacks while Peter is in a fog. Peter ducks with a
6th sense, sweeping Rufio to the dirt, blade at his throat.

PETER
It's just like riding a bike, Rufe.

RUFIO
Kill me, old man. You won.

PETER
(leaning on his blade)
The thought did cross my mind. But
I need you, Rufio. When I face Hook,
you better be there covering my butt.

Rufio hesitates, looking at everybody around them. He
realizes what a complete butthead he’s been.

RUFIO
Me? R' you talkin’ to me?

Peter removes his sword extending his hand. Rufio takes
hold, pulling himself up.

A GROUNDS KEEPER sweeps some empty bottles across the
cement path. "Tink-tink-tink"--

- PETER
(thinking)
Tink...

He shrugs. Whatever it meant, he's already forgotten. With
new life, he races away down the path.

THE VIEW CLIMBS To: TINKERBELL! Standing behind the
statue's head. Her back to us as she watches Peter picking
up speed, pulling farther away, until he's gone.
Tink turns. Glowing tears dot her face. She flies away.

EXT. #14 - THE NURSERY WINDOW - MORNING

Maggie, Jack and Tootles peer out the closed window.

.Morose. Suddenly Maggie lights up--jumping and pointing.

WITH PETER - RACING UP THE STREET

He stops, instinctively looking up to the window. He jumps
up and down when he sees them--"they're alive"! Hooting and
celebrating life--the "new" Peter hops up on the garden
wall and walks it--doing exactly what he told Jack not to
do--He makes it--all the way—-without falling!

Bowing to his children applauding in the window, he leaps
the garden fence and dashes the shortcut to the front door.

INT. '14 ' CONTINUING ACTION

Moira opens the door. Peter bursts in--eweeps Moira off her
feet laughing like a loVesick teenager--and a serious kiss.

» HOIRA
Oh, Peter---Peter--I thought I'd
lost you. All of you. Ina:
last later?

I

PETER
(shocked confused)
Last night? I--don't know...hll I
know is--I love you Moira. I love you!

Maggie skitters down the stairs and sails into Peter's arms

MAGGIE
Daddy! I knew you'd come back. I
never gave up.

Peter is suddenly facing Granny Wendy. He bows to her
beautifully. [the way Pan did when he first met Wendy]

PETER.
Hullo,'Wendy Moira Angela Darling.‘

' WENDY
Hallo, Peter. Do you know where you are?

PETER
Where.I...belong. Where I want to be.

They embrace, filled with emotion and unconditional love.
Peter spots Tootles watching at the foot of the stairs. He
can't speak. He just grabs Peter and hugs him tight.

PETER
(something clicks)
Tootles-~I've got something--I think
belongs to you. I don't remember--

He removes the pouch from his neck. Tootles brightens,
barely able to contain himself. Peter pours the marbles
into his gnarly hands---

TOOTLES
Bee?--I didn't lose my marbles afterall.

Granny Wendy hugs him warmly. Tootles drifts upstairs,

caressing his happy thoughts. He passes Jack--waiting on
the stairs--feeling guilty-~cut off.

mother did---Jaok can't fight his tears.'JACK JUMPS--flying
into his Daddy's arms. Moira hugs them both.

MOIRA
You're all safe. We're together. We
can just be the way We were...before.....

PETER
_ (lucid, focused)
I love all of you so much. But we’ll
never be the same as before. There's
' something we've got to do. All of us--

He leaps up and touches the chandeleir--then bounds quickly
upstairs, leading them all--Granny Wendy, too.

INT. NURSERY - THE WINDOW - CONTINUING ACTION
Peter leads his family toward it--He scowls angry--
PETER

What did I tell you aboﬁt this‘

,Anger melts to mirth. He unlocks it throwing it open wide.

Jack and Maggie open the other side.
EXT. THE WINDOW - WIDEN SLOWLY FROM:

PETER
Take a deep breath everybody. Breathe.

THE VIEW CLIMBS.UP UP UP I FLYING OVER KENSINGTON GARDENS

Up through the clouds. We bank in a sweeping are over Big
Bend and the Thames River. London gleams in the morning
sun. TOOTLES SWOOPS INTO VIEW! Whooping with pure joy. He
shakes the last of Tink's pixie dust from his marble pouch
on his craggy face, basking in the golden glow.

He pauses and waves goodbye to each of us. Then zooms away

heading for Neverland. Laughing like that child he was. The

child we all were. The child in us that can never die.
