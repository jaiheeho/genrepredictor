LETHAL WEAPON 11

November 1988

FADE IN:

EXT. A REMOTE AREA OF LAX - DAY

A United 747 barrels down the runway. It lifts off
and passes overhead with a DEAFENING ROAR. And thats
when . . .

MARTIN RIGGS STEPS INTO FRAME

He looks up at the underbelly of the jet. So low that
he could count the rivets. Except Riggs doesn't appear
to be in any shape to count anything.

Unshaven. Hair matteé. A grease-stained baseball cap
pulled down low to keep the sun out of his blood~shot
eyes. Re raises a brown paper bag to his lips. Heaven
help us . . . Riggs is back in the bottle.

CUT TO:
ANOTHER PART OF THE REMOTE AREA
where a MERCEDES LIMO pulls up to a GULFSTREAM JET;
The Gulfstream's engines are REVVING in preparation
at take off.
CUT TO:
MARTIN RIGGS

staggering drunkenly through the weeds and tall grass
that fringe this remote sectian of the airport.

RIGGS
(singing softly}
"Jingle be11,'jing1e bell, jingle
bell . . . rock."

Behiné him. a Delta 727 touches dawn. Wheels SLAMMING
against the runway; brakes SQUEALING; jet engines
SCREAMING in reverse thrust.

CUT TO:
THE MERCEDES AND THE GULFSTREAM

FOUR MEN emerge from the Mercedes. South Africans.
HANS, PETER, KARL and ROLF.

Karl pops open the trunk and SEVERAL SUITCASES are quickly
unloaded and placeé'on the tarmac beside the Mercedes

Peter’s eyes dart furtively behind his black—out shades.
Karl SHOTS the Mercedes trunk lid. Hans picks up two
of the suitcases and takes a step toward the Gnlfstream
-- then stops abruptly.

Why? Because a drunk is weaving towards them.

Riggs rolls his eyes. Takes another hit from the bottle
in the brown paper sack. Licks his lips. Stumbles.
Regains his balance. Advances toward the men.

lThe South Africans exchange a look, then Bans moves
forward to intercept Riggs.

HANS
Hey, buddy. Where you going?

RIGGS
(speech slurred)
Anybody seen a dog? Lookin' for
my dog.‘ Ran off and got lost.
Maybe you seen him? A brown dog?
Four legs . . . one tail. Face
like this —~

Riggs contorts his face into a weird expression.

HANS
Come on, pal. No dog around here.

Hans clamps his hand down firmly on Riggs' shoulder.
Riggs sways from side to side and giVes ﬂans a bleary—eyed
look. '

RIGGS
I just gotta find that dog. Know
what I mean? He's a good dog.

Hans spins Riggs around, points him in the opposite
direction and gives him a shove.

HANS
Go sleep it off somewhere.
Riggs takes several wobbly steps, then stops -— bends
at the waist —- appears to PURE his guts out. Hans

grimaces. And that's when . . .
A FORD BRONCO ROARS INTO TﬁE SCENE
Brakes SQUEALING as it skids up to the Gulfstream.

The South Africans turn to look —- knowing instantly
that something has gone very wrong for them.

HANS
The suitcases£ Grab the suitcases!

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON RIGGS' BACK

as Riggs straightens up and spins around . . . eyes

clear and alive; wider than hell -- nostrils flaring

-‘ arm extended, gripping a silver NINE MILLIMBTER BERETTA
that flashes in the midday sun. This is one very dangerous,
and very sober cop we have here.

RIGGS
(screaming)
POLICE! FREEZE! HANDS ON THE CAR!
LEGS SPREAD APARTE NOW!

AN UNMARKED POLICE SEDAN

SKIDS up from another direction. ROGER MURTAUGH leaps
out with his pistol drawn. Riggs regards Murtaugh with
an expression that is hardly welcoming.

RIGGS
You're late! I had to do my lost dog
routine and my puke routine!

MURTAUGH
You didn't give me the signal!

RIGGS
I gave you the signal! -~ Jingle bell rock:

MURTAUGH
The signal was Jingle bell rolli

Riggs sticks a hand under his shirt with a disgusted
expression and YANKS out the WIRE he's been wearing.

THREE COPS

have jumped from the Ford Bronco with service revolvers
drawn. They wear jeans and distinctive satin jackets
that have "L.A.P.D DRUG ENFORCEMENT“ lettered on the
back. We'll see these guys again. Their names are:
TIM CAVANAUGH, GARY PRICE and TOM WYLER.

They rush toward the flummoxed South Africans . . .
but here's something they didn't count on:

THE GULFSTREAM PILOT
appears in the cabin doorway brandishing an UZI SUBMACHINE

GUN. A rapid BURST OF FIRE scatters the Drug Cops.
They dive behind the Bronco for cover.

MURTAUGH
Oh, shit!

Now things hapgen fast we

Riggs ROLLS beneath the Gulfstream, behind the landing
gear.

Murtaugh DROPS down behind his Sedan, FIRING off several
ROUNDS.

Hans grabs a suitcase, RUNS up the boarding steps and
disappears into the Gulfstream.

The other South Africans produce weapons from beneath
their coats and BLAST their way back into the Mercedes.

The Drug Cops are pinned down by UZI GUNFIRE. Murtaugh
tries to nail the Pilot -~ but only succeeds in drawing

his tire. The Pilot SPRAYS THE ﬁll in Murtaugh's direction.
Murtaugh ducks behind his Sedan as bullets RIP THROUGH

the car's HOOD and GRILL.

RIGGS

crouches low under the Gulfstream‘s fuselage, working
his way toward the front. The REVVING ENGINES are HOT
and NOISEY.

Now Riggs is directly beneath the boarding staircase.
The spent shell casings from the Uzi Submachine gun
(CHATTERING directly OVERHEAD) dance on the tarmac all
around him.

Riggs grabs hold of the staircase and makes his move
. . . fast, and with the agility of a cat, he SWINGS
out from beneath the airplane -- pulling himself upward
ww face to face with the startled Pilot -- BERRETA OUT
—- fire EXPLODING from its muzzel at point blank range.

The Pilot is blasted backwards into the Gulfstream,
—- the Uzi SPRAYING BULLETS through the roof of the
fuselage as he falls.

INT. COCKPIT OF GULFSTREAM
Hans Banics. He doesn’t know how to fly a plane, but

he wants to get the hell away . . . so he PUSHES FORWARD
on the THROTTLE just enough to put the plane INTO MOTION.

OUTSIDE THE GULFSTREAM
Riggs is on the staircase when the plane begins to TAXI

FORWARD. The staircase TEARS AWAY from the Gulfstream's
fuselage SPILLING Riggs to the ground.

Riggs TUMBLES beneath the wing, where -- flat on his
_back W- he sees the LANDING GEAR ROLLING TOWARDS KIM!

RIGGS
Gooohhhhhh -- I

He rolls out of harm's way —— the landing gear coming
within inches of crushing him. But now Riggs must
contend with the SEARING HEAT expelled from the Turbcfan
Jet Engine as it passes over him.

THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GULFSTREAM'S WING

SHEERS off the roof of the Ford Bronco as it passes
by. Meanwhile . . .

THE MERCEDES

SQUEALS away in cloud of exhaust smoke. But in their
hurry to escape with their lives, the South Africans
have forgotten about the TWO SUITCASES resting on the
tarmac. The Mercedes FLOWS into them, sending them
flying. One of them OPENS . . . and BUNDLES of U.S.
CURRENCY spill out.

RIGGS
gets to his feet. Murtuagh rushes up to him.

The Glufstream is rolling off in one direction, and
the Mercedes has driven off in the other.

RIGGS
(pointing at Gulfstream)
That one is mine! You take the Benz!

Riggs doesn' t even wait for Murtaugh' 5 reply. He just
RUNS OFF after the Gulfstream.

Murtaugh and the Drug Cope jump into the DECAPITATED
BRONCO and speed away.

THE MERCEDES LIMO

races across the perimeter of the landing field. The
Bronco chasing after it.

RIGGS

chases the moving Gulfstream on foot we running like

a gazelle. He catches up to it —— LEAFS onto the wing
from behind and holds on tight. He works his way over
the wing toward the OPENING IN THE FUSELAGE where the
door used to be.

THE BRONCO

overtakes the Mercedes. Now they're side-by-side.
GUNFIRE is exchanged out the windows of the two vehicles.

The Mercedes attempts some wild evasive turns, but the
Bronco sticks to it like glue.‘

RIGGS

is on the wing of the Golfstream. He tries to SWING
INTO THE DCORWAY. His foot SLIPS. He almost falls
beneath the moving plane. He holds on tight with both
hands . . . but LOSSES HIS BERETTA m- it slips from
his belt azd BOUNCES on the ground.

Riggs PULLE himself up into the airplane.
INT. COCKEIT OF GULSTREAM

Close quatsrs. Very cramped. Hans swirls to face Riggs,
FIRES his gun. Misses. Riggs YANKS him out of the
cockpit. The fight is on.

EXT. RUNKEY AND ENFIELD

The Mercedes cuts diagonally across the runway. headed
toward the TERMINAL AREA. The Bronco right on its tail.

They reach the AIRPORT APRON. This is where the planes
dock and there is considerable GROUND SERVICE traffic
in the area. Such as . . .

A BAGGAGE SRAIN that crosses the Mercedes' path. No
time to avoid it -— CRASHi —- the Mercedes RAMS it!
SPLITS it apart! Travels directly through it. Luggage
scattered everywhere.

The Bronco follows —— destroying the luggage even further
-— dragging articles of clothing from its bumper.

Suddenly . . .

A BOEING 727 that is being BACKED AWAY from the gate

looms up i; front of the Mercedes. The Mercedes BRAKES

—- SKIDS i: a pool of oil -- SLEWS sideways out of control
towards a FUEL TRUCK.

Ground Service CREW MEMBERS see it all unfolding and
lea? for safety.

INT.‘ THE XERCEDES

Peter and Rolf are frozen with fear. But KARL, in the
back seat, KICKS OPEN the door and RAILS OUT.

EXT. THE MERCEDES

It SMASHES into the Fuel Truck. EXPLOSION! FIRE BALLﬁ
The Bronco swerves to avoiﬁ the inferno.

Karl rolls across the pavement. gets to his feet and
RUNS.

CUT TO:
THE GULFSTREAM

rolling -w with no one in control —- toward an ANCHOR
FENCE at the airport's perimeter.

INSIDE THE GULSTREAM

Riggs and Hans beat the shit out of each other. ﬁans
knows as much about Martial Arts as Riggs does. Both
men are being brutally punished.

CUT TO:
INT. BAGGAGE DEPOT

Karl runs in, shouldering his way past several BAGGAGE
HANDLERS who try to stop him, and HDPS ONTO THE CONVEYCR
BELT that carries the luggage into the terminal. Shaving
suitcases and parcels aside, he runs u? the belt.

Moments later MURTAUGH ARRIVES.

MURTAUGH
Police oﬁficer! Police officer:

He flashes his badge without ever breaking striée.
And when he sees the conveyor belt, he knows this is
where Karl has gone. He leaps onto the belt as well.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING * BAGGAGE CLAIM

Karl SLIDES down the shuts onto the BAGGAGE CAROUSEL,
upending himself and several pieces of luggage in the
process. Startled PASSENGERS react to the sight.

Karl heads for the Exit Door. But an AIRPORT SECURITY
VEHICLE PULLING UP T0 TﬂE CURB outside causes him to
change direction.

MURTAUGH

SLIDES down the shuts onto the Carousel, KICKING pieces

of baggage from his path, vaulting to the floor. Passengers
have already become blase at the sight w» they barely

even look. ’

Murtaugh spots Karl running ahead and chases him down
a U C O

TERMINAL CORRIDOR

Fatigue begins to set in for Mortaugh. He runs on rubber
legs; PANTING and PUFFING.

Up ahead are several REVOLVING DOORS. Passengers from
arriving flights are using these doors to enter the
Baggage Claim area.

Karl waits for the doors to clear of people, then slips

in. But guess what? These doors only turn in one direction.
When pushed the wrong way they LOCK and an ALARM SOUNDS.

And that's what happens to Karl.

He‘s trapped. tuck inside the revolving door. He
can‘t believe it.

Murtaugh rushes towards him.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON KARL

Does he throw up his hands and surrender? Not on your
life. He PANICS ww he raises his gun and POINTS IT
AT MURTAUGH.

MURTAUGE

swings up his own gun. At the same moment ——

THE THREE DRUG COPS

arrive from the opposite direction. All WEAPONS EXPLODE.
Bystanders SCREAM and duck for cover.

The revolving door is SHATTERED and Karl's bullet riddled
body PIROUTTES through the broken glass.

MURTAUGB AND THE DRUG COPS

exchange an exhausted look as they holster their hand
guns.

CUT TO:
EXT. KNOLL ABOVE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY
At the top of the knoll is the ANCHOR FENCE that surrounds
the Airport. The knoll slopes gently downward do the
BUSY HIGHWAY below.

We watch as —-

THE GULFSTREAM TEARS THROUGH THE ANCHOR FENCE and SLIDES
DOWN the embankment toward the Highway.

INT. THE GULFSTREAM

Riggs and Hans are THROWN FORWARD as the plane drops
-w TUMBLING head over heels down the center aisle.

EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY

The Gulfstream trails a giant CLOUD OF DUST as it rolls
across the highway. BRAKES SQUEAL. HORNS HONK. Traffic
screeches to a halt. A CHAIN-REACTION of REAR—END COLLISIONS
results. CRASH! CRASSi CRASH!

The Gulfstream continues across the highway toward a
BLUFF that overlooks the BEACH and the OCEAE BELOW.
A sheer drop that would mean certain death for Riggs
and Hans inside the plane.

INT. THE GULFSTREAM

Riggs glances through the windshield w— sees the bluff
approaching. The hell with Hans, he's got to stop
the plane. And that‘s just what he does —— POLLING
BACK HARD ON THE BRAKE LEVERS. ‘

But during this . . . HANS LEAFS OUT OF THE PLANE onto
the highway below.

EXT. THE HIGHWAY

The Gulfstream SKIES TO A STOP with its NOSE WHEEL DANGLING
over the cliff. PHEWH!

HANS

runs along the highway. Traffic has come to a complete
stop for miles. People climb from their cars to gawk

at the spectacle. So it isn‘t very hard for Bans to
STEAL one of these cars, make a U-TURN and escape.

EXT. THE GULFSTREAM

Riggs appears in the doorway holding Eans‘ SUITCASE.
A CROWD OF SPECTATORS pushes forward to get a look at
him.

The Ford Bronco ROARS up followed by TWO HIGHWAY PATROL
CARS. SIRENS are SCREAMING. BUBBLE LIGHTS are FLASHING.

Sensing Murtaugh's authority, the crowd parts, clearing
a path for him. Riggs hops down from the Gulfstream.

/G

Murtaugh marches up to him. Riggs looks pretty beaten
. up and very pissed off.
MURTAUGH
What happened?i

RIGGS
What happened?? I stopped the plane,
that's what happened!

MURTAUGH
Where's your guy?

RIGGS
what about your guys? How many collars
did you make?

MURTAUGH
No collars. Three bodies. But at
least they didn’t get away.

RIGGS
Get off my back. I captured a plane
and a suitcase full of money . . . and
it's still before lunch.

. MUR’I‘AUGH

3-,_ (after a pause)

Speaking of lunch, isn’t there a
hot dog stand a few miles down the
beach from here?

CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY as Riggs and Murtaugh push
their way through the crowd.

Someone's CAR RADIO is PLAYING LOUDLY:

RADIO
. . . a KNXT Newsradio traffic
tipster informs us that there's a
a stalled jet plane tying up traffic
on the Pacific Coast Highway in
the LAX area. That's right: . . .
a stalled jet plane. So if you’re
headed in that direction, look for
an alternate route or expect to be
stuck in traffic for most of the day.

DISSOLVE TO:
.‘ INT. A PRIVATE ELEVATOR

Hans rides up in the elevator. His arm is in a sling.
His face bruised and swollen.

//

INT. ELEGANT OFFICE - DAY

The private elevator opens directly into the office,
which is tastefully. and expensively. appoizted with
antiques and oriental rugs.

Hans enters the office, which at first glance seems
empty. Then we notice him. Seated not at :is desk,
but at a small table where he is eating his lunch.
His name is ARJEN RUDD

RUDD
Bans. Come in. Sit down over here.

Rudd indicates the chair across the table f:om him.
As Hans comes forward, he realizes that he ;s WALKING
ON A SHEET OF PLASTIC that has been laid over the carpet.

RUDD
Don't mind the plastic. I'm haYan
some painting done.
(beat)
Sit dOWn.

Hans sits. Rudd is enjoying a thick steak for lunch.
He slices off a piece and slides it into his mouth.
Hans sits nervously, waiting for Rudd to speak.

RUDD
So tell me, Hans —— what went wrzng?
The police were waiting. We lost a
considerable amount of money. no: to
mention the airplane.

HANS
I don't know, Mr. Rudd. I workei
out every detail myself. I left
nothing to chance.

RUDD
I see.
(beat)
Just had luck, huh?

Rudd calmly cuts another piece of steak and oops it
into his mouth.

HANS
I think it was inevitable. Taking
the money out in small shipments is
much too slow and much too dange:ous.
We should do it all at one time, in
one enormous shipment.

Rudd doesn't reply to this suggestion. In fact, he
changes the subject completely.

{Z

RUDD
How's the arm? You all right?
(smiling)
Live to fight another day?

Bans relaxes. Reassured by Rudd's expression of concern.

HANS
Yes, sir. I'm fine. Thank you.

RUDD
Sometimes things simply do not turn
out as we plan them.
(smiles)
This steak, for example. "Cajun" style.
Look, it's all black. Do Egg like it
that way, Hans?

HANS
Well, I . . . don‘t know.

RUDD
Here. I want you to taste this
and tell me what you think.

Rudd slices off a piece of steak for Hans, spears it
with his fork and offers it to him.

As Hans leans forward to take the piece of meat in his
mouth, we HEAR: PHHHITTI And Hans is propelled BACKWARBS
in his chair. A BULLET through his FOREHEAD.

MR. BENEDICT

appears, having entered from the bathroom. holding a
SILENCED PISTOL in his hand. He’s a wiry, loose~jointed
weasle with madness in his eyes ané a perpetual smirk
playing upon his lips.

He looks down at Hans‘ body. Blooé is pumping from
his head wound onto the plastic sheet.

BENEDICT
You give new meaning to the word
"dropoloth," Mr. Rudd.

Beneéict removes the ROLEX WATCH from Hans’ wrist before
wrapping up the body in the plastic.

RUDD
Certain policemen in this city have
become an intolerable nusiance.

BENEDICT
I was saying the same thing just the
other day. Maybe you heard my speech
before the Junior League.

Rudd is familiar with Benedict's peouliar sense of humor.
He proceeds without reaction:

RUDD
Is your team assembled?

BENEDICT
Ready and waiting.
(meaning the
Rolex:}
Say, can I keep this?

Rudd voices no objections as Benedict slips the watch
onto his wrist.

RUDD
Hans was an incompetent piece of
shit . . . but he had one good idea
in his life, and he just gave it
to me: One big shipment. That's
exactly what we're going to do.
Move it all out at once.

BENEDICT
You're going to need something bigger
than a suitcase for that.

RUDD
That can be arranged.
{beat}
Now, about these cops . . . how do
we handle them?

BENEDICT
Ready to declare war?

RUDD
Not if we don't have to.

BENEBICT
Then let's fire a warning shot across
their how. Hope they get the message.

Rudd removes a PHOTOGRAPH from a folder.

RUDD
Have a look.

Benedict takes the photo . . . it’s a PICTURE OF MURTAUGH.

/3.4
BENEDICT
Who's this?

RUDD
He's the cop in charge.

Benedict practically licks his lips.

BENEDICT
Oh this is going to be lovely.

INT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM

Murtaugh strides across the room. CAPTAIN MURPHY falls
into step with him.

MURPHY
Have you heard the grand total?
Five point six million.
Murtaugh WHISTLES; impressed at the amount.
CAMERA FANS to FIND RIGGS. Seateé in a chair, struggling
to free himself from a STRAIGHT JACKET while the Drug
Cops (Wyler, Price and Cavenaugh) look on.

WYLER
Give it up, Riggs.

Murtaugh and Captain Murphy arrive.

é/Tpﬁer Me

PRICE
One minute, fifteen seconds.

MURPHY
What's going on?

. CAVANAUGH
Houdini here's het us he can free
himself inside of five minutes.

Murtaugh reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll
of bills.

MURTAUGH

I‘ll cover that bet. How much?
WYLER

Save your money, Sarge. One minute,

Riggs.

Riggs is building up to something. Straining against
the jacket, his face flushes and the veins in his neck

pop out . . . co
RIGGS Q
Don't try this at bpme, boys and
girls . . . IQ
is.

That's when WE HEAR a LOUD POP! and Riggs winces in
pain. Murtaugh knows exactly what Riggs is up to.

MURTAUGH
(smiling)
It‘s all over now.

The Drug Cops are startled to see Riggs suddenly wiggling
free of the jacket. Here‘s one hand —~ and there's
another. He unhooks the jacket and slips it off.

The Drug Cops are astounded. They also moan and groan
over having lost the bet.

. PRICE
How'd you g9 that?

RIGGS'
Dislocated my shoulder once . . .
I can make it pop out i‘ I want to.

WYLER
Doesn't that hurt?

Riggs has now gotten to his feet.

15

. RIGGS

Oh, yeah. But not as much as when I pop
it back in

Which he does -— by SLAMMING his shoulder against the
wall. then clenching his jaw against the pain.

MURTAUGH
Why do you do this to yourself?

RIGGS
I can't resist a challenge.
Besides ~—
(as he scoops up
his winnings)
‘— I need the money.

Murtaugh goes to the coat rack and grabs his sports
coat. Riggs follows him over.

RIGGS
Let’s you and me try on the new
special down at the Chs ' Palace.

mquﬁuss
(slipping on his jacket)
Can‘t tonight.
(beat)
What is it?

ﬂux

RIGGS
Chili pizza.

Murtaugh makes a disgusted fees at the very sound of

it.
MURTAUGH
(softly)
Rianne‘s commercial is on tonight.
RIGGS
Rianne's in a commercial?!
MURTAUGH
Hey. Not so loud.
RIGGS
What's the matter w- aren't you proud
of her?
. MURTAUGH

What it she stinks?

”M.

entire Squad Room)
Hey! Listen up. Tonight . . .

RIGGS

MURTAUGH

Riggs turns back to face theiﬁguad Room again.

”Rises

Tonight. Channel five at eight—fifteen.
The commercial debut of Rianne

Murtaugh. The Sarge's beautiful
daughter. Don‘t miss it.

Riggs smiles at Murtaugh, but Murtaugh just gives him
a sour look in return.

MURTAUGH
She better not stink.

EXT. MURTAUGH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Murtaugh's SEDAN pulls into the driveway next to his
fishing boat on its trailer. Riggs glides up to the
curb in his PICKUP TRUCK. Both men climb out.

MURTAUGH
Follow me. Wanna show you something.

Murtaugh leads Riggs around to the back of the house.
EXT. REAR OF HOUSE

A ROOM ADDITION is being added to the Murtaugh house.
The framing is up. Some drywall. The windows are in.

Murtaugh and Riggs enter the room by walking between
two of the framing studs.

/7-

INT. THE ROOM ADDITION

A long—haired. 30 year old CARPENTER is down on his
knees using a FNEUMATIAC NAIL GUN to install the plyWood
subwflooring. Each application of the gun generates

a loud THAWOMPE sound.

MURTAUGH
Working late tonight.

The Carpenter looks up, didn't even know Riggs and Murtaugh
were standing there.

CARPENTER
Yeah. Wanted to get this sub-flooring
down today.

'THAWOMPI THAWOMP! THAWOMP!

MURTAUGH
Doesn't anybody use hammers anymore?

CASPENTER

That‘s what I thought.

RIGGS

Riggs nods. Silence. Then ~—
MURTAUGH

I can retire when I'm fifty—two, you
know. Get almost full benefits until
I‘m fifty~five when the whole free
ride kicks in.

RIGGS
Fifty-two, huh?
MURTAUGH
Only a couple months away.
RIGGS
You wanna retire?
MURTAUGH
Been thinking about it . . .

. . . ever since I met you.

A7.

:sGS
Thanks.

NERTAUGH
Anyway. now that I got me a hobby
room, all I gotta do is —-

Riscs

They laugh together while e::ering the house through
a hole in the wall.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM

THUNDERING FEET bounding dcw: the stairs: Twelve year—old
NICK MURTAUGH and his eight year-old sister. CARREE.

They run into the living roam where Murtaugh, Riggs,
TRISH MURTAUGE (Roger's wife} and 19 yearuold RIANNE
have already gathered to wazeh the TV. (Rianne, by
the way, is a total knock o::.)

CARRIE

Even Riggs has to stifle a grin at this.

RIANNE
Nick!
Murtaugh steps away from the set with an appraising
look.

RIGGS
Perfect picture; R09.

MURTAUGH
(unconvinceé)
Think so? . . .

Murtaugh is about to sit on the sofa when he notices
GEORGE for the first time. George is Rianne's boy friend.

MURTAUGH
Who's this?!
RIANNE
That's George, Dadey.
GEORGE
Hi . . . sir. “‘0

MURTA H

George . . . do 1.3 you?

other

Yes, sir. Don‘t you remember?
Last week when I picked up Rianne.
We had a long talk. :

Murtaugh clearly has no recollection of this whatsoever.

MURTAUGH
We did? About what?

GEORGE
Your new hobby room, sir.

MURTAUGH
Did we get along, George? I mean,
did you get the sense that I liked

you?
GEORGE
Yes, sir. I did. Very much so.
. MURTAUGH
Okay. You can stay. But move down.

George moves over on the sofa making room for Murtaugh.
Everyone‘s attention is glued to the TV.

RIANNE
It's coming on! It's coming on:
I'm so nervous ~-

Then, she sees herself on TV . . . and SCREAMSE

RIANNB
-- here it isli

T818 IS RIANNE’S COMMERCIAL:

She smiles into the camera. A big, beautiful smile.
Is this a toothpaste commercial? Then she turns and
runs away from camera. We realize she's on a beach
. . . and she*s wearing the SMALLEST BIKINI EVER MADE.

She runs into the arms of a MALE MODEL who is also wearing
a bathing suit.

ANNOUNCER {V.O.)
Now, more than ever, love needs all
the protection it caanet.

Rianne and the Male Model kisgaas a PACKET OF CONDOMS
is supered over them. be

Isn't it better . . . when you know it's
safe?

Then, Rianne and the Male Model turn toward the camera
and intone:

RIANNE &
MALE MODEL
We think so:

And that's the end of it. Trish hits the mute button
on the remote. The room falls silent. Murtaugh is
glaring threatenly at Riggs, who squirms in his seat.

Finally, Rianne breaks the silence.

RIANNE
I looked fat. -
TRISH
No, you didn‘t, honey.
GEORGE
Ilﬂssit!
MURTAUGH‘

George . . .

GEORGE
Yes, sir?

MURTAUGB
Go home.

SEGRGE
But --

MURTAUGH

-- George, I have a gun.

George leaps up from the sofa and heads for the door.
Rianne goes after him.

MURTAUGH
Trish. Take the kids upstairs.

Trish knows that tone of voice. She shoes Nick and
Carrie up the stairs. Murtaugh begins to advance on
Riggs. Riggs gets to his feet.

RIGGS Q3-
Now wait a minute, Rggar. She was
great. She looked g at. What‘s
the matter with xSQPl

MURTAUGH

Murtaugh stalks out of the house.

RIGGS
(to Trish)
Sandwich would be fine.

INT. THE KITCHEN

Riggs leans against the kitchen counter. standing up,
eating a sandwich as Trish unloads the éishwasher.

Riggs watches her as if mesmerized by this simple domestic
chore. Perhaps she feels his gaze. because she turns

to look at him.

TRISH
You're welcome to sit at the table.

RIGGS
I like to eat standing up.
{hands her his
empty plate)
Thanks.

Trish takes the plate -— looks into Riggs‘ eyes ~— sees
his troubled look. .
TR§.&

(very svﬁpathetically)
Something w rang?

Riggs ooesn' t answer4§ight away.

RIGGS
Four years ago this week . . . that's
when Vicki died . . . can't get it
out of my mind.

TRISH
Is it something you want to talk
about?

Riggs lights up a cigarette, shakes out the match, takes
a pull on it, expells the smoke. Trish takes this as
a “no. I!

TRISH
You don't have to.

But Riggs wants to. He goes right into it.

RIGGS
The phone was ringing when I walked
in the door. Must've been ten
or eleven at night. I answered the
phone and got the news. She was
dead. Killed in a car crash. And
then I remember going down on my
knees, shaking all over and thinking,
"Here I go. I'm losing it." So
now I'm lying on the floor of the
living room . . . seeing under the
couch . . . and there‘s my Cross
pen I was looking all over for.

And then I heard a voice . . . like
a drill instructor . . . saying,
"Get up -- now:" But I stay down.

And the voice keeps telling me to

get up. And then I did something
weird. I decided to stop crying, just
to see if I could. And I could.

And then . . . I stretched my mouth
into a smile. I we hurting, but

my muscles still WE: ed . . . and I
stood up. After ghat. I drove to

the morgue. Id tified the body. And
signed the p_ s with my Cross pen.

Trish is moved by the stbry. But Riggs himself is unfazed
almost detached from it.

RIGGS
I can talk about it. It doesn't hurt
to talk about it.

TRISH
Then what does? Because you sure as
hell have some other demon inside of
you .

RIGGS
{after a moment; his
expreSSion now filled
with emotion)
I was cheating on her, Trish. The
night she died . . . I was with somebody
else.

Trish doesn‘t know what to say . . . but now she becomes
aware of Murtaugh standing in the kitchen doorway.
Riggs turns and sees him, too.

MURTAUGH
You never told me that.

RIGGS
I know.
MURTAUGH
That's what made you crawl into the
bottle.
Riggs nods his head.
MURTAUGH

Man should be faithful to his wife.
Some men just can't. That's you.
But you didn't cause the accident.
Martin. What you did didn't make
it happen.

Riggs put his‘hand on Murtaugh's shoulder.

RIGGS
You're right. Cochise.

It just makes it harder to live
with.

Rianne positively lights up.

RIANNE
You mean it, Martin?

I think you'va got a big future ahead

of you.

She’s practically swooning. George is becoming a little
jealous. Riggs sees it, and tries to include him.

RIGGS-
Don't you agree, George?

George opens his mouth to speak, but doesn't get a word
out.

RIANNE
George is going home. He's afraid
of daddy.

RIGGS

George, let's have a talk.

ZX.

Riggs puts his arm around George's shoulder and takes
him aside in a fatherly manner.

RIGGS

Stick around. It‘s a big
night for Rianne. Bon't let her down.

GEORGE

But, sir .'. . Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.
RIGGS

That‘s true, George.

(beat)
But on the other hand. he isn't a
very good shot.

with those comforting words, and an encouraging slap
on the back, Riggs takes his leave of George and Rianne.

Riggs enters his trailer.

Riggs heads straight forﬁehe fridge, where he removes
a bottle of beer, angles the neck against the table
edge and KNOCKS off the cap with the palm of his hand.

He picks up the Remote Control, turns on the TV and
settles back on the sofa to watch.

Riggs' dog, SAM, enters the trailer through a DOGGIB
DOOR IN THE FLOOR and jumps onto the sofa next to Riggs.

RIGGS

(to Sam)
I know we usually watch the Three
Stooges at this time, but tonight
there's a documentary on Public TV

Wyler and Price laugh at the joke.

There's a tone of gravity in his voice that chills the

air.

But not Riggs.

MURTAUGH

Murtaugh flashes him a look.

MURTAUGH

RIGGS

We think Murtaugh's going to bite Riggs’ head off at
the suggestion . . . but then he surprises us with a
very wide smile.

MURTAUGH
Shit, Riggs . . . you just wanna

RIGGS

Huh? . . .

Murtaugh fumes. Riggs angrily lights up his third cigarette,

Murtaugh looks through the peephole to be certain it's
Room Service, then opens the door. The Waiter rolls
in the cart and parks it in front of the window. He
reacts to the sight of Murtaugh and Riggs, but nobody
notices except us.

Riggs lifts the silver dome. We expect him to find'
Ham & Eggs & A Gun . . . but he doesn't. There is an
order of Hamburger and Fries instead.

' RIGGS
Come get your hamburger, Leo.

Now the Waiter reaches down into the LOWER COMPARTMENT,
where he has moved the plate containing the gun.

LED
Hey, I didn't order a hamburger.
I ordered eggs.

This causes Riggs to turn back in the Waiter's direction
—— just in time to see THE GUN COMING UP FROM BEHINB

RIGGS
GUN!

Riggs and Leo throw themselves at the Waiter. They
BUMP HEADS LOUDLY in the process, but Riggs is able

to grab the Waiter‘s hand, and the gun DISCHARGE:S into
the ceiling.

Murtaugh draws his gun, but can't get a clear shot because

A Riggs and Leo are struggling with the Waiter. Leo is

only getting in the way . . . and now he throws everybody
OFF BALANCE .

Riggs, Leo. the Waiter and the Serving Cart CRASH through

The Waiter EXPLODES OUT OF THE WATER and starts to climb
from the pool. But Riggs GRABS him by the belt and tries
to pull him back. He'd have more luck if Leo wasn’t
CLINGING to Riggs' neck.

RIGGS
Let go:

All three FALL BACK UNDER THE WATER. Sunbathers look
on with horrified expressions; frozen in place; incapable
of lending assistance.

Then Riggs POPS UP again. ﬁe*s got a grip on the Waiter,
who now has the window curtain WRAPPED AROUND HIS HEAD.

Riggs PUNCHES him HARD in the face several times until
a BLOOD STAIN appears on the curtain. Riggs feels the
Waiter go limp in his arms. He unwraps the curtain
and discovers that HE'S BEEN BEATING UP LEO!

Leo's nose is bleeding and he wears a dazed expression.

Turning, he sees the Waiter escaping on the opposite
side of the pool. Riggs drops Leo, who immediately
begins to sink . . . and Riggs GOES BACK to save him.

expression on his face.

EXT. NARROW CANYGN ROAD - DAY

It's so lush and overgrown with bushes and trees that
it's hard to believe we're only ten minutes away from
Beverly Hills.

A TOW TRUCK blocks most of the narrow road while the-
OPERATOR connects the towing bar to the undercarriage
of a stalled HONDA.

Murtaugh's Police Sedan can be seen approaching.

LEO Q3
Yeah, yeah.‘ I reﬁember the fountain.

The house itself cannot e seen from the road -- hedges
and trees block the View. But there is a marble fountain
visible, and this is what Leo recognizes.

Murtaugh pulls up BEHIND the Tow Truck. Riggs jumps
out.- Leo tries to follow him.

RIGGS

inside the house lifting weights.

MURTAUGH

RIGGS
The body beautiful.

INT. THE BOUSE

The man is tall, well built and blonde ~~ like the Ritmen
from the opening scene. He lifts a HEAVY BARBELL over
his head as he faces a MIRRORED WALL.

backwards. .

Riggs‘ gun is drawn even before he crashes down onto
the deck. And it' s a good thing, because the weightlifting
Eitman has grabbed up an UZI.

Riggs gets off several rapid SHOTS. The Hitman’s UZI
SPRAYS WILDLY. Potted plants on the deck rail explode
and shatter into small bits.

Murtaugh and Riggs PUMP LEAD right back at him, until
the Hitman FLEBS out the back door.

EXT. DRIVEWAY

The Hitman runs from the house. He‘s about to leap
into the 4508L perked there when he realizes that the
Tow Truck is BLOCKING the driveway.

His only choice? Absolutely. He runs down the driveway
and JUMPS INTO THE TOW TRUCK. The Tow Truck Operator
has just finished hooking up the disabled Honda when

he hears his Truck's MOTOR ROAR TO LIFE.

OPERATOR
Hey!

Riggs and Murtaugh arrive just as the Truck SQUEALS
AWAY . . . pulling the Honda behind it. Riggs LEAFS

Murtuagh makes a dash for his own vehicle.

his way up toward the T uck's Cab, holding onto the
TOWING BOOM for support ~- taking care not to be seen
in the rearview mirror.

The Truck is taking the curves at dangerous speeds causing
the Honda it‘s towing to FISHTAIL in all.directions.

THE POLICE SEDAN

ROARS up behind the speeding Tow Truck. Murtaugh can
see what Riggs is up to.

CLOSE ON RIGGS

as he TAPS the barrel of his pistol against the cab's
rear window to get the Hitmen's attention. The Hitman
glances over his shoulder. Riggs smiles, as if to say
"Surprise, asshole!"

pulls away as the window EXPLODES in his face, and the
bullet GRAZES his cheek. FOUR MORE SHOTS follow through
the hack of the Cab's wall. Riggs LEAFS onto the TRUCK‘S
ROOF to escape the volley.

INT. THE ?OLICE SEDAN

Murtaugh stays close on the Truck's tail . . . and is
startled to see that Riggs is how clinging to the roof.

INT. CAB OF TOW TRUCK

The Hitman hears Riggs on the reef and . . . SLAMS DOWN
HARD ON THE BRAKES. SQUEALING and SKIDDING.

RIGGS

Well' this would seem to tépthe end of Riggs, because
he would certainly be ushed beneath the Truck. But
of course we know it isn*t . . .

‘A REVERSE ANGLE ON THE TRUCK

finds Riggs CLINGING to a small triangular PLATFORM
protruding from the Truck’s front bumper‘ (This platform
holds a WINCH & CABLE RIG used to pull cars out of

mud or soft sand.)

Riggs straddles the Winch, his legs out in front of
him, the HEELS of shoes SCRAPING on the pavement as
it speeds beneath him.

THE HITMAN

checks his side mirrors —— sees that Murtaugh is still
behind him. '

FULL SHOT - WINDING CANYON ROAD

The Tow Truck THUNDERS around the hairpin turns, crossing
the center line -- the Honda it‘s towing WEIPS back

and forth. Murtaugh’s Sedan matches the Tow Truck's
every move.

S

RIGGS' POV

Imagine being strapped to the bumper of a speeding vehicle
—— that's the perspective Riggs has on the world right
now, and it isn‘t very comforting.

The paVement is whizzing by only inches below him.
He's totally unprotected -- a head~on collision would
smash him like a bug.

And this is exactly the thought that occurs to Riggs
as the Truck crosses the center line directly into the
path of an ONCOMING STATEON WAGON.

Riggs shuts his eyes -- and the two vehicles SWERVE
APART at the last possible second to avoid a direct
hit. But the Station Wagon SCRAPES against the Tow
Truck's side sending a SHOWER OF SPARKS into the air.
Riggs exhales an enormous breath of relief.

Murtaugh also reacts to the near—miss as the Station
Wagon speeds by with HORN BLARING. Leo takes this moment
to FASTEN his seat belt. 6%

The Tow Truck runs a‘ top sign and SQUEALS onto Mulhclland

Both vehicles race full bore down Mulholland, against
the backdrop of the sprawling San Fernando Valley.

CLOSE ON THE TRUCK'S SPEEDOMETER

As the needle edges up to 70 mph.

CLOSE ON MURTAUGH*S SPEEDOMETER

Also creeping up to seventy.

RIGGS' POV:

Speeding FAST and LOW down Mulholland ~- BLOWING past
oncoming traffic we SWERVING around slower moving vehicles

mu DARTING back into the proper driving lane with only
inches of daylight to spare.

Riggs has his gun in hand. What's he going to do with
it? Shoot the Truckfs driver? Shoot out a tire? But
first . . .

A HUGE MOVING VAN

looms up ahead, traveling in the same direction as the
the Truck . . . but at half the speed.

THE HITMAN

decides to pass it. He STOMPS down on the gas pedal,
kicking the Truck’s speed up to 80. At the same moment

t c :

RIGGS

FIRES his gun into the Truck' 5 engine compartment, hoping
to hit something vital that will bring this mad chase
to a halt. And guess what? It works.

THE HITMAN

is stunned to feel the Truck loosing power. The speedometer
needle begins to drop rapidly L . . 70 mph, 50 mph.

See if you can spot Riggs‘ mistake. One of the worst
times to lose power is when you're recklessly passing
a big truck on a winding road.

BE:

THE TOW TRUCK Q

is side—by-side with the Qéking Van. It doeSn't have
enough power to get ar und it -— and it can't get back
into its own lane because the Moving Van is already
there.

And to make matters worse, a LAND ROVER with a SURF
BOARD ATTACHED TO THE ROOF is speeding towards it from
the opposite direction.

RIGGS

sees this horror—show unfolding from a front row seat.
The Moving Van looms up beside him like a sheetemetal
canyon well. Its big tires spitting gravel and dust
into his face. Its noisy niesel engine belching smoke
and heat.

And the Land Rover . . . headed directly for him.
THE HITMAN

has only one option: He SLAMS his foot down on the.
BRAKE so hard. he practically sends it through the floorboard
The resulting action happens fast:

THE TOW TRUCK WHEELS

LOCK -- SCREAMING and SQUEALING across the pavement
in a cloud of blue smoke.

RIGGS
is THROWN OFF the Winch Platform into the road.
MURTAUGH

reacts -- hitting his own brakes. But there just isn't

The Honda has been totaled by the Land Rover, which
has also sustained considerable front end damage. But
the Driver is uninjured.

Riggs climbs to his feet. Battered and bruised and
madder than hell. He charges back toward the Tow Truck
with his gun out, but stops short. This is what he
sees:

The Surf Board protrudes from the Tow Truck's windshield
on the driver's side. It‘s not hard to imagine the
fate of the Hitman inside.

Those blankets will offer you some

bathtub. Pull the blanket up over
your head like this.

That's a good, old—fashioned cast iron tub,

Riggs enters the office from the elevator. It's immaculate.
There is no indication that any work is done here.

No files. No paperwork. Nothing for Riggs to snoop
through. '

Maybe this is why the note pad on Rudd's desk calls
so much attention to itself. As Riggs moves toward
the desk, he HEARS SOMEONE COMING.

He quickly RIPS THE TO? PAGE FROM THE NOTE PAD then
steps back against the wall.

Rudd charges into the office from the elevator without
even seeing Riggs and picks up his telephone. Riggs
steps forward. He's followed by Benedict and FOUR

him there with his foot.

The other Hitmen make a gesture to attack and Riggs
DRAWS HIS GUN stopping them in their tracks.

in its pleasant smell.

MURTAUGH

Riggs and Jill enter the cramped trailer through the
sliding glass door. The expression on Jill's face
acknowledges the disparity between her expectations
and what she now sees.

» JILL
You must be an honest cop. Martin
Riggs.
RIGGS

Disappointed?

d73-

JILL
Not in you.
RIGGS
It's everything I said. Check out

the View.

She looks at the sunset through the sliding glass door.
The sky is a firey shade of orange.

JILL
what are those lights? Ships?

Riggs comes up behind her.

RIGGS

Oil drilling platforms.

(beat)
Sometimes at night, it gets so dark
you can't see your own hand in front
of your face. The sky and the ocean
are completely black. and the only
things you can see are those drilling
platforms ten miles out to sea.
Twinkling like Christmas trees.

During this, Riggs has placed his hand on her shoulder.
Jill turns, tilts her head up togsﬁﬂ Riggs and giVes
him a knowing smile.

.333:
This is a sedugtion, isn‘t it?
_ RIGGS
What do you mean? . . . why do you
say that? .
JILL
You're trying to sweep me off my
feet . . .
‘RIGGS
Maybe.
JILL
Make my head spin . . .
RIGGS
Yeah.
JILL

Wrap me around your finger . . .

f

09?

R2665
Okay.
JILL
I'm not stupid, you know.
RIGGS
Not a bit.
JILL

i know what‘s going on. You can’t get
to Rudd. He's hiding behind

his diplomatic credentials. You

think I can help you in some way.

Right?
RIGGS
Uh-huh.
JILL
Well . . . Maybe I can. And maybe
I will. We can talk about that later.
RIGGS
Later?
JILL Q53

Yes. Afterwards . .Q

She puts her arms around hiéSQECk and kisses him on

the mouth. Riggs responds$ sliding his hands up her
back. Jill breaks off the kiss, pushes away from him
and pulls closed the curtains on the sliding glass door.

JILL
And you're not a gourmet cook, are
you? »
RIGGS

Sure I am. Says so right on the
frozen food container.

She begins to unbutton her dress. Riggs turns toward
the bed -- Sees SAM curled up asleep -~ SLAPS him on
the ramp.

RIGGS
Beat it! No Stooges tonight.

Sam hops off the bed and exits the trailer through the
floor Doggie-Door. Riggs throwa back the blankets,

.exposing the sheets.

‘7.

when he turns back toward Jill, she is moving towards

him, her dress loose and opened, falling off her shoulders.
Riggs slides his hands under her clothing and pulis

her down to the bed.

EXT. THE OCEAN * NIGHT

A GRUMMAN ALBATROSS comes in low over the ocean. The
pilot kills the engines and it glides in, smooth and
silent.

It slides into the water on its belly, trailing behind
it a wake of rippling moonlight.

CLOSE ON THE ALBATROSS

as FOUR SOUIH AFRICAN HITMEN hop out wearing wet—suits
and carrying automatic weapons. They wade through the
surf toward shore.

INT. RIGGS' TRAILER

Jill is under the sheets. 4 Riggscg sitting on the

. . . it goes into the car's alarm
system. It senos out a signal that
the police can follow. In case the
car gets stolen.

JILL
You want to put that into Road‘s car.
Yes?

RIGGS

Yes. Tonight. Can you get me in?

JILL
All you had to do was ask. But I'm
glad you didn‘t.

EXT. THE TRAILER — NIGBT

The Hitmen nalk up to Riggs' trailer and form a line
parallel to it. They hold their weapons in position.

INT. THE TRAILER

The silence of the night is suddenly shattered by an
ERUPTION OF AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE. The sliding glass door
EXPLODES, blowing a thousand sharp projectiles through
the trailer. ’

7/

Riggs pulls Jill to the floor.

RIGGS
DOWN£

 

Both are naked. Riggs grabs his jeans, wiggles into
them. Jill clutches her dress.

MACHINE GUN FIRE TEARS through the trailer's metal sides.
The NOISE is deafening . . . Wood cabinets are CHEWED

into SPLINTERS . . . Windows DISINTEGRATE like bursting
soap bubbles . . . Appliances are PULVERIZED. Everything
is being DESTROYED: DEMOLISHED; CONSSMEB in a hail of
blazing weapon's fire. '

EXT. THE TRAILER

The Hitmen SPRAY the trailer with gunfire. As one clip
is exhausted, they calmly and methodically slap in another.

INT. THE TRAILER

The FUSSILADE seems never ending. The trailer is literally
being TURN and SHREDDED apart. The ceiling begins to
COLLAPSE as the metal sides BUCKLE and BEND under the
punishing attack.

Riggs and Jill have flatened tségselves against the
trailer’s floor. Automatic weapons fire WHIZZES only
inches above their heads. '

Riggs’ hand reaches up fog §isseretta and shoulder
holster. GRABS IT. Pull it towards him. Now, he
begins to move across the loo: on his stomach, pulling
Jill with him . . . inching their way toward the '
floor Doggie-Door.

UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER

Riggs and Jill emerge from the Doggie-Dog. The area
under the trailer is less than three feet high. Above,
the DEFEANING BARRAGE of GUNFIRE continues without let

up.

Jill struggles into her ﬁress. Riggs digs into his
pants pockets for his truck keys. 8e gives them to
Jill and gestures for her to get moving.

JILL

crawls out from under the trailer on the side opposite
the attack.

432

RIGGS

crawls out in the other direction. Moving rapidly on
his stomach across a sand dune like the trained Sgecial
Forces Commando that he once was.

He COMES UP BEHIND THE Hitmen. He takes a deep breath,
then RISES UP into a shooting position. 8AM. BAN. BAN.

Three Hitmen drop like marionettes with their strings
cut. But the Fourth Hitman TURNS and SPRAYS a VOLLEY
of MACHINE—GUN FIRE in Riggs’ direction.

Riggs leaps and rolls to the side. The Hitman advances,
machine-gun CHATTERING. Then . . . the ROAR OF A TRUCK
ENGINE. The BLINDING GLARE of headlights.

RIGGS‘S PICKUP TRUCK

HURTLES out of the darkness, fishtailing through the
sand. A fender SLAMS the Hitman from behind, throwing
him twenty feet in the air. He comes down hard on his
shoulder.

Riggs scrambies to his feet. The Pickup ROARS down
on him. The passenger door flies open. The truck doesn't
slow down. Riggs GRASS the open dooéb SWINGS his body

into the cab. Q
The Bitman climbs to his knees. ﬁgHe FIRES at the departing
truck. .' B .

~

INT. TRUCK'S CAB

Jill is behind the wheel. Riggs sass SOMETHING in the
SIDE MIRROR. ’

RIGGS
Slow down: Slow down!

SAM IS RUNNING after the truck as fast as his four short
legs will carry him. Machine—gun fire KICKS UP SAND

all around him. The truck slows down just enough, allowing
Sam to LEAP ONTO THE TAILGATE and climb into the cargo
bed.

EXT. THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSULATE * NIGHT

Riggs and Jill stand across Wilshire Blvd. from the
Consulate.

. RIGGS
What about the video camera over
the door?

JILL
It‘s only on during business
hours. But there's an alarm system
with a 45 second delay.

RIGGS
You know the code?

JILL
(smiling)
Who éo you think turns it off every
morning?

INT. CONSULATE LOBBY * NIGHT

We HEAR the KEY IN THE LOCK. The door opens and Riggs
and Jill enter.

Jill goes immediately to the KEY PAD on the wall and
punches in the code. The RED LIGHT turns OFF . . .
and the GREEN LIGHT comes ON . . . indicating that the
system has been disarmed.

JILL
This way.

She leads him down a SERIES OF CQQIDORS until reaching
the Parking Garage Door. The sea: requires another
key. She Opens it for him. Q:

INT. RUDD'S APARTMENT

Benedict crosses the room. He sees something that troubles

him.

RUDD
What’s the matter?

Benedict indicates the GLGWING GREEN LIGHT on the key
pad.

BENEDICT
Someone's shut off the alarm.

For a moment. they just stare at each other. Then,
the RED LIGHT COMES 0N AGAIN.

Now it's on again.

BENEDICT
Turn on the camera:

EXT. CONSULATE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Riggs and Jill emerge quietly from the Consulate's front
door. As she closes it behind her, the RED LIGHT on

the VIDEO CAMERA comes on, indicating that the camera

is now in use.

Riggs and Jill don't notice this.

EXT. AN APARTMENT HOUSE COURTYARD — NIGHT

A 30's Style stucco apartment building. Like the ones
off Olympic Blvd. in Beverly Hills.

Riggs walks Jill to her apartment door.

RIGGS
Thank you.

He gives her a kiss.

PIGGS
I've got to go.

JILL
Did we start something tonight, or
just end it?

Riggs sighs to himself.

RIGGS
I’m not good relationship material.
I don't think I have much of a future.

JILL
Just plenty of past.

RIGGS
More than I need.

INT. MURTAUGH‘S HOUSE w NIGHT

Murtaugh and Leo are sitting on the safe. The TV is
playing, but nobody is watching . . . because Leo is
reviewing Murtaugh‘s TAX RETURNS. ‘

LEO
What I see here are nice
conservative returns. Everything
by the book. Everything black and
white. What you gotta do is
play around in the gray areas a
little more. This is where you
can really save some bucks. Granted,
on your salary we don’t have much
to work with. What you really need
are more éeductions.

MURTADGH
More deducticns, huh? . . .

LEO
Right. Let's say you pay off an
informant. Get a receipt and take
a deduction.

(beat)
If you buy yourself some food during
a stake-out . . . get a receipt and
take a deduction.

(beat)

You use your own credit card to buy
gas after a high-speed chase . . .
get a receipt and take a deduction.

MURTAUGB
Thanks. Leo. I‘ll remember that.

Murtaugh begins to collect his returns, putting everything
back in a large envelope. Leo brings up a subject
that has clearly been haunting him:

LEO
I guess . . . after I cooperate with
the Feds . . . tell them all I know
. . . I go free. Right? No jail time?

MURTAUGH %
Could be, Leo. Could gt».

LEO q.
That‘s good. BecaSte I've learned
my lesson. Fro now on. it‘s the
straight and nar ow for me.

MURTAUGH
Of course, the government's gonna
confiscate everything you own. Your
home. Your car. All your possessions.
And they're gonna seize all your
assets: Bank accounts, CD'S. stocks.
Whatever they can find.

LEO
They are?!

MURTUAGH
That‘s how it is, Leo. You don‘t
get to keep what you don’t get legal.

LEO
Fuck.

As he gathers up his tax records, Mortaugh comes across
a piece of paper that gives him pause. He‘s So preoccupied
with it, that Leo notices.

77.

LEG
What's that?

MURTAUGH
The Bill of Sale for my fishing
boat . . .

Murtaugh remains distracted by the Bill of sale in his
hand. Something is going on with him, the wheels are
turning in his head._

LEO
Well. guess I'll turn in.

MURTAUGH
{without looking up)
Okay, Leo. Good night.

Once Leo is gone, Murtaugh goes to a shelf where VIDEO
TAPES are stored and takes one down.

He puts the tape into the VCR and presses PLAY. This
is what we see:

THE MURTAUGH FAMILY OUT ON THE BOAT.

There's Nick clowning around on deck. And Rianne posing
in her bikini. There‘s Murtaugh wearing a Captain's_

Hat and waving at the camera. 8
Murtaugh presses FAST FORWARD and§advances the tape;
searching.

.. cc“

RTAUGH

Where is it? Where is it? -.- .
INT. THE BATHROOM

Leo enters. The shower curtain is drawn across the
tub. Leo pays no attention to this, but he is curious
about the OPEN BATHROOM WINDOW.

As he approaches to take a closer look, the SHOWER CURTAIN
is quietly pulled back and a South African HITMAN STEPS
OUT OF THE TUB.

Leo turns . . . but all he gets to see is the SHOWER
CURTAIN being LOWERED over his head -- wrapped around
his neck -- and pulled tight, shutting out the air.

Leo's being ASPHYXIATED by the Hitman. ﬁe flails his
arms and kicks his feet, but he‘s no match for the Hitman's
superior strength.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM

Murtaugh continues to Fast Forward through the tape.
Then he stops . . . rewinds a little . . . plays it
forward.

We see what looks like more of the same; the Murtaughs
at play on the family boat. But Mortaugh sees something
that we don't. ﬁe rewinds. Plays it again. Bends

in close. Rewinds. Plays it again. Slow motion.

Very close to the screen. Looking hard. Rewinds.

Plays it again. One frame at a time.

MURTAUGH
(hushed)
I knew it.

What's be looking at? In the background of one shot

is a FREIGHTER. A great big ocean-going cargo ship.

And the name painted on the Freighter‘s bow is: NORA
DANE.

Murtaugh actually touches his finger to the screen right
where the name appears.

MURTAUGB Q3
(smiling) Q
Hora Dane . Q

q; .
Then: Murtaugh sees a REFLECTEDN IN THE TV SCREEN.
Someone behind him! He whirls around -- finds himself
face to face with the SOUTH AFRICAN HITMAN.

He doesn't think M~ he just reacts. He TEROWS A PUNCB
against the Hitman‘s jaw.

The Hitman is propelled backwards against the wall,

but BOUNCES BACK WITH A VENGEANCE. He overwhelms Murtaugh
with a series of Martial Arts KICKS and JAES that fairly ‘
WHISTLE through the air.

Murtaugh is beaten back into the:
HGBBY ROOM

Where he CRASHES to the floor within inches of the the
CARPENTER’S TOOLS.

The Hitman advances. Murtaugh SWINGS UP his arm, the
PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN in his grasp. BAH! He fires a nail.
THUNK! Right between the Hitman's eyes. The expression
of surprise on his face is almost comical. He sinks

to his knees and keals over onto his face.

Murtaugh staggers to his feet, head reeling. Holding
his side, he stumbles back into:

THE LIVING ROOM

Only to see a SECOND HITMAN approaChing from across
the room with a KNIFE in his hand. It takes Murtaugh
a moment to bring him into focus.

The Hitmen comes forward slowly, like a predatory animal
stalking wounded prey. Murtaugh rocks back and forth

on his heels, still unsteady from the beating he just

took. He raises the Nail Gun —— goints it at the approaching
ﬁitman and fires —— BAM'

The Eitman grabs a small END TABLE by the legs and uses
its top as a shield. TRUNK. The nail sinks into the

wood.

The Hitman keeps coming. Holding the table in front
of him. Murtaugh AIMS LOWER -- 8AM: . . . The Hitman
lowers the table -w THUNK . . . Murtaugh AIMS HIGHER
-— 3AM! . . . The Bitman raises the table ~- TEUNK.

And that's the last nail Murtaugh 9259 to fire, because
the Hitman is now right on top of ﬁgm -— SWINGING the
table throngh the air ~~ SMASHIQg it against Murtaugh' s
skull.

Mu: taugh‘ s knees buckle, butshe doesn' t go down. The
Hitman RUSHES HIM, his knife pointed toward Murtaugh' s

gut.

They struggle. We HEAR the nail gun diacharge: BAN!
And the Hitman staggers backwards and falls . . . a
NAIL THROUGH HIS HEART.

MURTAUGH
(amazed)
Sonofabitoh . . . I nailed 'em both.

INT. THE BATHROOM

Murtaugh charges in.

MURTAUGH
Leo!

But all he finds is the torn shower curtain and the
open window.

it. Shoves it under the nose of . . . LEO GETZ. The

hand SNAPS THE TAB. Beer EXPLODES out of the can, SPRAYING
up Leo's nose with great force.

Leo rears his head back in distress. CHOKES. SPITS.
GAGS. GASPS for air. Beer yours from his nose and
mouth. He's drowning on suds.

ACAMERA PULLS BACK to include BENEDICT. Smoking one

of his thin cigars.

BENEDICT
Where’s the money, Leo? Bow Each did
you take? We want it back, Leo!
Where is it?!

Leo is TAPED to a chair, like Trish and Murtaugh were
taped to their bed. Leo doesn‘t answer. He blows
beer out of his nose ané tries to clear his throat.
Benedict grabs another beer and shakes it up.

BENEDECT
What's the deal, Leo? You'll talk
to the Feds but not to me?£ That's
not fair. That hurts my feelings:

He shoves the second beer under Ledﬁs nose. Lao tries
to turn his head away, but a Sou African Bitman forces
it back around. Benedict POPS.2§ ,TAB with the same
results as before. ‘

Leo chokes, spits and nearly dies.
CAMERA PULLS BACK to inclﬁde RIGGS. Seated next to
Leo. Also taped to his chair, but with his mouth taped

shut as well. And Riggs is SCREAMING IN ANGER behind
the tape.

Benedict RIPS it off.

BENEDICT
You got something to say!?

RIGGS
You bastard! You're dead! Ycu're
dead!

BENEDICT
No, Riggs —— zou're the one Who's

You killed him while he was hanging
upside down, Completely
helpless! I found your fucking cigar

BENEDICT
Yeah. I did Tommy. I killed him.
So what? I enjoyed it. It was fun.

Riggs SPITS in Benedict's face. Benedict SLAPS Riggs

hard.

“M.

She didn't die right away, either.
She took awhile.

Benedict was right . . . Riggs is coming engined. His
face flushes. The veins in his neck pop out. He struggles
against the tape that holds him down.

BENEDICT
Where the hell were you, Riggs?!
:23 were supposed to be driving that car,
not your damned wife:

RIGGS
You fucking sonofabitch!

BENEDICT
The funny part was, by killing her,

night of your life.

EXT. A FISHING BOAT - THE OCEAN - NIGHT‘

The boat hobs in the water. Riggs is on deck, wearing
a VEST made of METAL CHAIN with LEAD WEIGHTS attached
to it.

The two South African Hitman wrestle Riggs to the boat's
gunwale. Riggs struggles and kicks. The Hitmen POUND
him a few times in the face.

HITMAN ONE
Any last words?

Riggs coughs and spits blood through now swollen lips.

RIGGS
You're under arrest. You
haVe the right to remain silent.

HITMAN ONE
Smart mouth. huh?

. Q: d
The South Africans CLOBBER Riggs iﬁflhe face some more,
then DUMP HIM OVER THE SIDE. '

UNDERWATER 3 Q '

Riggs' weighted vest PULLS HE? STRAIGHT DOWN, fifteen

feet, to a sand bar below. The water's cold and dark.
We can barely make out Riggs. He HITS BOTTOM, raising
a cloud of sand in the Water. DIMLY SEEN OBJECTS sway
lazily in the current.

ABOVE WATER - IN THE BOAT

One of the South Africans angles a SEARCHLIGHT down
toward the water.

HITMANV TWO
Let's give him a show.

UNDERWATER

Suddenly flooded with LIGHT. Jesus Christ! We get

the shock of our lives . . . these “dimly seen objects”
turn out to be CORPSES! And Riggs is right in the middle
of them.

/07'

All in various stages of decomposition and wrapped in
chains. Rolling and shifting with the ocean current.
Staring up from dead, fish—eaten faces. Clothes rotted
away in tatters. Some little more than skeletons.

Except one . . . JILL! . . . still beautiful, even in
death. Her naked body white as marble.

Riggs can't believe his eyes. Horror and pain fill
his expression. But now he fights back harder than
ever.

ABOVE WATER - IN THE BOAT

The TWO South Africans peer into the water. see the
TURBULENCE below, the signs of struggle.

HITMAN TWO
How long?

HITMAN ONE
Minute ten. And still kickin‘.

UNDERWATER

Riggs thrusts against the chain vest, pulling it tight
across his back we POP! -- dislocates h' houlder.
A silent scream of.agony as the chains 1 and loosen.

ABOVE WATER - IN THE BOAT ‘nﬁfh

The South Africans look OVer thé‘port side of the boat
when Riggs EXPLODES OGT OF THE WATER on the starboard
siée. He leaps into the boat like a mad demon, one
arm hanging limo.

The South Africans turn, but don't have a chance. Riggs
is upon them before they know it. And he kills them

both . . . TWISTING THE NECK of one . . . SNAPPING
the other's BACKBONE over his knee.

And then. Riggs releases a PRIMAL SCREAM of anguish
ané pain as he JAMS his SHOULDER back into its socket
by SLAMMING it against the whee1~house wall.

CUT TO:
EXT. 'A CANYON - NIGHT
We don't know exactly what's going on here.

Riggs is wrapping a HEAVY CHAIN arouné something that
resembles a telephone POLE.

MLURTAUGH IS WITH HIM. The two men exchange a lock
that is GRIN and DETERMINED.

RIGGS
Let's do it.

Murtaugh drives away in his Police Sedan.

Riggs watches him deyart. then climbs into the cab of
his truck. He turns on the ignition and FLOORS THE
GAS PEDAL.

The BACK TIRES SPIN MADLY in the soft dirt . . . the
motor ROARING.

EXT. DECK OF "STILT" HOUSE ~ NIGHT

Benedict hears the ROARING TRUCK MOTOR from the canyon
below and comes out onto the deck. He peers down into
the oarkness.

Riggs has wrapped the chain around the CORNER STILT
that supports the house. The other end of the chain
is attached to the Truck . . . and Riggs is pulling
the house down!

Benedict has only a moment to register a look of alarm
before a LOUD CRACK echoes across the gsnyon, and the
deck begins to LIST and sway beneathQSis feet. -

INT. THE LIVING ROOM , (:9

All hell has broken loose. Thgyhouse has begun to SHIFT!
The SOUNDS of timbers CRACKING; nails CREAKENG as they
bend and pull free; plaster BREAKING; windows SHATTERENG;
water pipes BURSTING; gas lines RUPTURING.

_MURTAUGH RUSHES IN from the front door.

TWO SOUTH AFRICAN GUNMEN enter from the hallway. EVERYONE
FIRES AT ONCE W” BAMi 8AM! BAH! 8AM! When the smoke
clears, only Murtaugh is left standing.

BENEDICT

sees Murtaugh inside the house.’ He RAISES HIS GUN ané
FIRES . . . but the shot goes wild because Benedict
has literally DROPPED FROM VIEW as . . .

THE HOUSE SNAPS IN TWO!

The half supported by stilts (the half that Senedict

is standing on) SLIDES DOWN THE CANYON. The rest of

the house, the portion built on solid ground at the

top of the canyon, remains behind. (This is where Murtaugh
is.)

to

/6’§

The SLIDING PORTION OF THE HOUSE plows a wide swath
through the trees and underbrush as it CRASHES down
into the canyon in a cloud of DUST and DEBRIS.

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Benedict clings to a doorway with both hands as FURNITURE
FLIES past him. Then he sees something out the opening
where the deck's sliding glass doors used to be:

The house is on a collision course with the TRUNK OF
A DEAD OAK TREE. glt protrudes from the ground at a

45 degree angle. Benedict SCREAMS as the house RUSHES
toward the tree trunk. SMASHE The tree trunk RIPS
THRQUGH THE HOUSE with tremendous force, halting its
forward progress down the canyon.

RIGGS HOPS FROM HIS TRUCK

He is triumphant. The only man in the history of the
L.A.P.D. ever to have brought down a house.

INT. THE "DESTROYBD" PORTION OF THE HOUSE

Riggs enters with his Beretta leveled. He chokes on

the dust. It's so thick he can hardly see. The place
has been EEMOLISHED. It doesn't even resemble a house
anymore. Especially with this ENORMOUS TREE TRUNK taking
up so much room.

Riggs picks his way through the debris. And then he
SEES BENEDICT: PINNED between the tree trunk and the
wall. Only his his upper body is visible . . . and
he's in agony. Riggs approaches him cautiously.

Benedict stares down at Riggs. His eyes glassy, but
filled with hate.

BENEDICT
{barely gets the words
out)
. . . you just won't die, will you?

Riggs regards him with loathing. Benedict struggles

to bring up his arm. He' 5 still holding his pistol.

He tries to aim it at Riggs, but doesn' t have the strength
to pull the trigger.

The gun slips from his hand, and he dies with his eyes
wide open.

/0é

INT. THE "INTACT" PORTION OF THE HOUSE

Leo (still taped to a chair} sits in the GAPING HOLE
where the house split apart —- his chair practically
TEETERING on the edge. He'd be enjoying a PANORAMIC
VIEW of the canyon and beyond, except for the fact that
his eyes have been taped shut.

Hurtaugh rushes to his rescue. He pulls Leo‘s chair
away from the brink of éisaster, then gently removes
the tape from his mouth and eyes.

MURTAUGH
Hi I Leo .

LEO
Sgt. Murtaugh! God. am I glad to
see you! I didn‘t know what was
going on! Sounoed like somebody was
pulling the house down.

MURTAUGH
Somebody was.

Murtaugh indicates the gaping,hole in the house. Leo
turns to see it . . . ané jumps to a very logical conclusion:

LEO
Sgt. Riggs is alive:

As if on cue, Riggs STRIDES IN.

RIGGS
You bet I am.

MURTAUGH
What about Benedict?

Riggs shakes his head, no.

’ MURTUAGH
Shoot him?
‘ RIGGS
No. You might say he went out on
a limb.
LEO

You want Rudd next?

RIGGS
Do you have to ask?‘

Murtaugh pulls off the tape from Leo's ankles and wrists.
Leo stands up‘ Wiggles his fingers to bring back the
circulation.

/07

LED
Then you better hurry.
I heard him talking to Benedict.
They taped up everything but my ears.
He's leaving the country. Today.
And he's taking his cash with him.

Riggs and Murtaugh exchange a look.

RIGGS
I‘m in the mood to spoil that
-basterd's travel plans. What about
you?

MURTAUGH

Sure . . . any ideas how to find him?
Riggs just smiles.
EXT. VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE -- NIGHT

Riggs' Pickup Truck speeds across the high. arching
bridge that crosses the L.A. Channel near the mouth
of the Harbor.

INT. THE PICKUP - NIGHT

Riggs is behind the wheel. Murtaugh and Leo are squeezed
into the seat next to him.

A FLASHING, BEEPING RED LIGHT on a RECEIVING UNIT attached
to the dashboard is directing Riggs toward Rudd's Mercedes.

EXT. PORT OF LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The letters "N w 0 - R w A _ D — A w N r E" come INTO
FRAME one at a time as the CAMERA PANS across the bow
of the ship.

The ship is docked beside a LOADING PIER. We see Riggs'
Pickup Truck traveling slowly down the pier.

INT. THE PICKUP

As they drive down the pier, the BEEPING SOUND grows
LOUDER and LOUDER.

MURTAUGE
I don't see it.

RIGGS
It's here someplace.
(meaning the beeper}
This thing is going crazy.

/05’

MURTAUGH
Pull over and park.

EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT

Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo climb out of the Pickup. ?hey
have parked beside an area where GIANT STORAGE CONTAINERS
rest on FLATeBED TRUCKS awaiting loading onto cargo

ships. (Note: These Containers are enormous. They're

as large as the trailers of the biggest eighteen wheelers.)

Riggs carries the Receiving Unit in his hand. The BEEPING
LIGHT is going wild.

RIGGS
It‘s coming from that container.

As they move toward the Container, Murtaugh notices
that Leo is tagging along.

MURTAUGH

Bidn't I tell you to wait in the truck?
LEO

No.
MURTAUGB

Well, I meant to.

LED
Too late now.

During this exchange. Riggs has climbed onto the bed
of the truck on which the Container is resting.

RIGGS
Roger! Look at this.

Murtuagh forgets about Leo, and hurries onto the flatbed
truck to join Riggs. Leo is right behind him.

Riggs indicates a STICKER attached to the CONTAINER
DOORS.

MURTAUGH
(reading what it says)
“Official Diplomatic Seal of the
Nation of South Africa."

RIGGS

Know what that means, Rog?
This Container is a Diolomatic Pouch.

[0?-

MURTAUGH
Right. Protected under Article 27
of the Vienna Convention.

RIGGS
Right.
(beat)
Screw Article 27.

MURTAUGH
Right.

Riggs FIRES TWO SHOTS into the lock. Then they swing
open the doors.

INT. THE CONTAINER

Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo are confronted with a STACK

OF BUNDLES. These bundles w~ which are perfectly square
and wrapped in brown paper -- rise to ceiling of the
Container.

MURTAUGH
Close the doors.

Leo SHOTS the doors behind them. Now they're in the
DARK.

MURTAUGH
Shit. Can‘t see a thing.

RIGGS
I can fix that.

Riggs WALKS AROUND the large stack of bundles and finds
what he knew would be there: RUDD'S MERCEDES.

He opens the door and turns on the HEADLIGHTS. Now
the Container is filled with a HARSH LIGHT that casts
EERIE SHADOWS against the Container's walls and ceiling.

MURTAUGH
That's great. Help us with this.

Riggs returns to help Murtaugh and Leo RIP AWAY the
brown paper wrapping. And this is what they discover
underneath:

MONEY! BUNDLES and BUNDLES of it. STACKS and STACKS
of it. ROWS and ROWS of it. TWO THOUSAND CUBIC FEET
of U.S. Currency in 20, 50, 100 and 1009 Dollar demoninations‘

MURTAUGH
Holy shit. '

#0;

RIGGS
Holy shit is right.
(beat)
Do you know what we‘re looking at
here?
MURTAUGH
Yeah. From here to here —- that‘s

a house in Beverly Hills. This
section over here -~ that's a 7
Rolls Royce and two Ferraris.

This part here ,- this is a lifeﬁime
of comfort and ease.

RIGGS
This is drug money, Roger. Probably
just a month’s worth of proiits.

LEO
Let‘s see . . . 27 cubic feet
of twenty dollar bills equals
five million dollars . . .
(pulls out a pocket
calculator)
This container is about ten feet
tall by eight feet wide . . .
stack‘s about six feet deep . . .
(taps in the '
numbers)
Jesus: All I stole was a few hundred
thousand. These guys are getting
away with hundreds of millions:

Murtaugh holds a WRAPPED BUNELE in his hand.

MURTUAGH
Look at this. These are thousand
dollar bills! What I‘m holding in
my hand could put ali three of my
kids through college!
{beat}
And I could fit it in my pocket.

Silence. Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo all share a look.
RIGGS
When I turn my back, Roger, you can
do anything you want.
Riggs moves off, leaving Murtaugh to battle the demons
of his conscience. Murtaugh glances at the money,
then at Lee, then tosses the money back.

Leo is impressed by Murtaugh‘s honesty.

/1/-

EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT

Rudd and TWO SOUTH AFRICAN HIT MEN walk down the pier
toward the container. Rudd looks upset. He glances
at this watch.

RUDD
Where the hell is Benedict?!
Did you call his house?

_ HIT MAN
Yeah, I --

RUDD
-~ was be there?

HIT MAN
I don't know ——

RUDD
-- did he answerl? Was the line
busy?!

HIT MAN
Nobody answered. The phone was out
of order.

This news makes Rudd grow visibly nervous.

RUDD
We can't wait any longer! Load
the container:

INT. THE CGNTAINER

RIGGS
We‘ve got to make sure this Container
doesn't go anywhere. '

Suddenly, they feel something.

RIGGS
What's that?

MURTAUGH
Shit. We're moving.

EXT. THE CONTAINER

The Container is being driven down the pier on the Flathed
Truck toward the ioading area.

Rudd and the Two Hit Men walk along beside it.

INT. THE CONTAINER

Riggs. Murtaugh and Leo peek out the crack where the
doors meet. They can't see anything except the pier
passing beneath them.

MURTAUGB
See anybody?

RIGGS
No.

MURTAUGH
Okay. Now what?

RIGGS
Stay with the container.

MURTAUGH
I say we jump.

RIGGS
Go ahead.

MURTAUGH
By myself?

RIGGS
Why not?

MURTAUGH

We're partners.

Rises
Then stay with me.

Then, they come to a stop.

RIGGS
We've stopped.

MURTUGH
Now what?

RIGGS
We jump out.

MURTAUGB

You keep changing your mind.

RIGGS
To fit the situation, yes!

Murtaugh pushes on the doors, but they DON'T MOVE.

HZ-

WM
t

MURTAUGH
They're stuck. They won't open.

EXT. THE CONTAINER

It‘s now parked beneath the LOADING CRANE. (This is
a huge four—legged crane that's as tall as a five—story
building. It straddles the entire width of the pier.)

A Traveling Carriage, called a CRAB, is lowered from
above. It GRASS HOLD of the Container. preparing to
hoist it up.

INT. THE CONTAINER

Riggs and Murtaugh hear the NOISE OVERHEAD as the Crab
CLAMPS onto the Container.

LEO

(looking up)
What the hell was that?

Now they feel a very strange sensation as the Container
is LIFTED UPWARD.

MURTAUGH
We‘re going up!

LEO
AI‘ve been on this ride before. It's
called “Free Fall.“

RIGGS
You better hepe not.

Murtuagh_puts his shoulder into the doors and they SWING
OPEN. But now they're FORTY FEET IN THE AIR.

EXT. THE PIER

One of the Hit Men LOOKS UP . . . SEES Murtaugh in the
open Container doorway.

INT. THE CONTAINER
Murtaugh jumps back from the opening.

MURTAUGH
They saw me.

RIGGS
Maybe they didn't.

This is followed by the SOUND OF MACHINE GUN FIRE as
bullets RIP UP through the bottom of the Container.

m

H4

LEO
No. Sgt. Murtaugh was right.

EXT. THE PIER

The two Hit Men aim their weapons in the air, SHOOTING
UP into the Container.

Rudd SHOUTS up to the OPERATOR'S CAGE to have the Container
lowered.

RUDD
Bring it down! Bring it down!

INT. THE CONTAINER

GUNFIRE TEARS THROUGH the bottom of the Container.
Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo manage to dodge the bullets.
but they know the odds are against them.

MURTAUGH
We‘re going back down! They‘re
taking us down.

Inspiration strikes Martin Riggs:

RIGGS
Get in the Mercedes!

INT. THE MERCEDES

Riggs climbs in behind the wheel. Next to him is Murtaugh.
Leo in back, as usual.

RIGGS 7
This time ~~ ;_get'to drivel

Riggs pulls a cluster of wires from under the dashboard,
crosses the right ones and the MOTOR FIRES UP.

All Riggs and Murtaugh can see out the windshield is
a WALL OF MONEY . . . but they know there's a pair of
cargo doors on the other side.

MURTAUGH
What about all that cash?

RIGGS
Blast right through it.

EXT. THE PEER

Rudd and the Hit Men watch as the Container is lowered.

RUDD
Don't let them get away this time!
Kill those sonsofbitchesll

EXT. THE CONTAINER

It's coming down. Thirty—five feet high . . . thirty
feet . . . twentyhfive feet . . .

INT. THE MERCEDES (INSIDE THE CONTAINER)

Riggs has the gear in neutral and the pedal pushed to
the floor. The Mercedes' motor is literally SCREAMING
at 5,000 RPM's -~ the NOISE RESONATING within the metal
Container.

RIGGS
Fasten your seat belts.

Suddenly, they feel the Container jerk to a stop.

RIGGS
That's it. We've hit bottom.

With the MOTOR RACING . . . Riggs jams the gear shift
lever into Drive . . . and the Mercedes ROCKETS FORWARD.

EXT. THE CONTAINER

The Cargo Doors EXPLODE OPEN and the Mercedes FLIES
OUT . . . PUSBING 2,000 Cubic Feet of MONEY ahead of
it.

One little problem . . . the Container hasn't reached
the pier yet. Something got stuck. It‘s still SUSPENDED
FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR. ‘

INT. THE MERCEDES

As the cloud of money clears, Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo
realize that the pier is well below them.

RIGGS, LEO
& MURTAUGH
0h, shhhhhitttt!!!

EXT. THE PIER

Rudd and the Hit Men look up to see an AIRBORNE MERCEDES
emerging through a FLURRY 0F CURRENCY . . . and it's
coming right at them.

Rudd STUMBLES BACKWARDS. The Hit Men DIVE for safety.

H0

The Mercedes CRASHES DOWN onto the pier. The SOUND
OF IMPACT is tremendous, but a Mercedes is built like
a tank, and the car remains intact.

The Hit Men scramble to their feet.
RIGGS AND MURTAUGH

leap from the car with GUNS BLAZING. The Hit Men don't
get off a shot -- both of them are BLOWN AWAY.

RUDD

looks dazed as MONEY FALLS FROM THE SKY and lands all
around him. Some of it is caught by the wind, and sent
swirling dow: the pier.

Riggs marches up to him.

RIGGS
You're finished, Rudd. It‘s all
over.

Rudd stares at Riggs with a pathetically bewildered
expression. Riggs turns his back on him, SNATCﬁING
A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL out of the air.

RIGGS
(smiling)
Hey, Rog . . . money from heaven.

Murtaugh smiles . . . and then his expression changes
to one of horror because Rudd has PULLED A KNIFE and
he's rushing up behind Riggs with it.

_MURTAUGH
Riggs -- :1

The warning is too late. Rudd STICKS the knife into
Riggs' back right above his hip bone «w then pulls it
out again.

Riggs' eyes go wide as a SHOOTING PAIN, like a thousand
volts of electricity. courses through his body. He
STAGGERS toward Murtaugh and Leo with an alarmed.
uncomprehending expression on his face.

RIGGS
Roger? . . . Ro era!

He falls into Leo's arms. Leo holds him up, keeps him
from falling.

Murtaugh SWINGS UP HIS PISTOL in a two-handed grip.
He is seething ~- guaking —- with a blind fury as he
points the gun at Rudd.

Rudd holds up his DIPLOMATIC CREDENTIALS like a shield
in front of his face.

RUDD
Diplomatic immunityli

MSRTAUGH
Just been revoked!

Murtaugh FIRES: The bullet TEARS A HOLE through Rudd's
credentials . . . then tears a hole through Rudd's head,
the impact propelling him backwards.

Leo craddles Riggs in his arms. Murtaugh bends down
to him.

RIGGS
Oh, Jesus. Roger . . . it hurts like
hell.

MURTAUGH

Take it easy, buddy. You been stuck
before. You been stuck before.

Murtaugh and Leo exchange a worried expression as SIRENS
of APPROACHING POLICE CARS are heard in the distance.

CUT TO:
SAME SCENE — MINUTES LATER
The pier is SWARMING WITH COPS now. Riggs is being
placed inside an AMBULANCE. Murtaugh hops in with him.
The doors close.‘ The Ambulance SPEEDS OFF.
LEO IS LEFT BEHIND

He watches the Ambulance depart. In all the confusion.
nobody pays any attention to him. He SLIPS AWAY . .

DISAPPEARING into the crowd.
INT. THE AMBULfNCE

A PARAMEDIC attents to Riggs who lies on his side, grimacing
in pain. Murtaugh comforts him.

RIGGS
I don't wanna die, Roger . . .

MURTAUGH
You won't. Say it again.

RIGGS
Don’t . . . wanna . . . die . . .
MURTAUGH

Say it again! Keep sayin' ~w

Murtaugh stops in mid-sentence. Riggs‘ eyes have fluttered
shot.

MURTAUGH
No . ... 22 wax! You're breathin'!
You're alive: You're not dead!

Riggs sure looks dead. The Paramedic urgently checks
for signs of life.

MURTAUGH
No! Don‘t die. You're not dead until
I tell you! Got that!

RIGGS
(weakly)
Go spit . . .

Murtaugh has never looked more relieved in his life.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. A BANK VAULT

This is where the SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES are kept. A

MAN enters. We can‘t see his face. His collar is turned
up. He wears dark glasses and a hat with the brim pulled
down.

He proceeds to empty the contents of two large boxes
into a suitcase. Of course, we’re talking about money.
SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS in large demonination

bills.
INT. BANK LOBBY

The Man emerges from the vault area with his heavy suitcase.
He only takes a few steps before he's GRABBED BY BOTH

ARMS.

It‘s Riggs and Murtaugh. Riggs has him by one arm;
Murtaugh by the other. Riggs removes the man's hat.
Murtaugh removes his sunglasses.

It's Leo. And he looks surprised.

LEO
Sgt. Riggs. Sgt. Murtaugh . . .

MURTAUGH
Hi, Leo. How ya been?

1(7-

RIGGS
Yeah. What‘s up. Leo? What’s in the
suitcase?

Leo is very uncomfortable. He looks around in all directions.

LEO
Is there someplace we can talk in
private?

MURTAUGH

Sure. (What about my car?
It's parked right outside.

That's when they SNAP THE CUFFS on his.

LEO
Oh. no. C‘mon, guys. Gimme a
break. After all we been through.
Don't do this to me.

RIGGS
Let‘s go, Leo.

They take him out.
EXT. THE BANK - DAY

They guide Leo into the back of the Police Sedan parked
at the curb.

INT. THE POLICE SEDAN

Murtaugh drives. Riggs next to him. Leo in back.
The car pulls away from the crub.

LEO
Guys. please. Have a heart.
Don't take me in. I'm no use
to the Feds anymore. Everybody who
I was gonna testify against is
dead. Ybu guys should know that‘
«w you're the ones who killed 'em!

MURTAUGH
Shut up, Leo.

LEO
Why did I ever give myself up in
the first place!? That was my
big mistake!

RIGGS
No, Leo. You did the right thing.

[$5

LEO
Some comfort that is to me now.

EXT. SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - DAY
The Police Sedan races South on the Freeway.
INT. THE POLICE SEDAN
Leo looks out the window with an alarmed expression.
Lao
Hey! Where we going? You missed

the turn—off!

RIGGS &
MURTAUGS
Shut up, Leo.

EXT. CALIFORNIA’MEXICO BOARDER CROSSING - DAY

Traffic is backed up for miles in both directions as
autos crawl through the CUSTOMS STATIONS.

Murtaugh's Police Sedan, however. slides into a Special
lane for Official Vehicles. Murtaugh flashes his badge
and he is waved through.

EXT. MEXICAN ROAD — DAY

The Police Sedan pulls off the road and parks. The
car's front doors fly open and Riggs and Murtaugh jump
out.

Now they remove Leo from the back seat, along with his
suitcase. Leo regards them expectantly .-. . and a
little apprehensively. -

Riggs REMOVES THE CUFFS from Leo's wrists.

LEG
Hey . . . what is this? . . .
RIGGS
You‘re free. Leo.
LEO
But . . . why?
MURTAUGH

Because we like you. Okay?

Riggs turns, puts two fingers into his mouth and WHISTLES.

IL!-

RIGGS
Pepe! Over here!

Twelve year»old PEPE comes over leading a BURRO on a
rope. The Burro is pulling a twowwheeled CART. Riggs
loads the suitcase into the cart.

RIGGS
(to Leo)
See? We thought of everything.

Leo looks overwhelmed. Murtaugh reaches out to shake
his hand.

MURTAUGH
Adios, Leo.

But instead of shaking hands, Leo gives Murtaugh a
hug. Murtaugh looks embarrased.

MURTAUGH
Okay. okay.

Now Leo turns to Riggs.

LEO
I‘ll never forget you guys.

RIGGS
You could if you tried.

Leo gives Riggs a hug. Riggs WINCES in pain.

RIGGS
Careful, Leo. That‘s where the
knife went in.

Lee steps back.

RIGGS
(to Murtaugh)
Come on. Let's get out of here
before we change our minds.

Riggs and Murtaugh climb into the car. Murtaugh starts
up the motor. Riggs leans out the window.

RIGGS
Hey, Leo . . . will you do something
for Roger and me?

LEO
Sure. You name it.

{22.
RIGGS
Live like a king.

And then. the Police Sedan peels away in a thick cloué
of Mexican dust as Leo watches, silently waving his

hand.
