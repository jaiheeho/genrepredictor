EXT. SALLY'S WOODS - MASSAPEQUA, LONG ISLAND ‘ DAY (1957)
THE SUN...leafy trees...summer...

A FACE, angelic, womanly, etched in a broad sunburst, calls.
A FACE we do not understand or will ever see again.

VOICE
Ronnie... Ronnie?

The last "Ronnie" drawn out, slowing down...suggesting
something mystical, now burning out into the sun as:

RONNIE, 10, looks, hears it, crouched - a stubby crewcut,
knees patched with denim, his plastic gun in hand, relieved
as...

TIMMY runs up, small and vulnerable in a c1umSy crouch, a GI
helmet on his head, gun.

RONNIE
D’you hear it?

TIMMY
What?

RONNIE doesn’t answer. He wonders, then forgets as he HEARS

legs  tearing through bush fast: Loud FX. Starts, looks,

RONNIE
.Let’s go, let’s go... We got 'em,
we got ’eml-

RONNIE and TIMMY up and moving FAST across trees and tangle;
an extended OVERHEAD TRACK drawing out the tension as:-r

INSECTS BUZZ louder...louder.

*' . TIMMY
Watch out!

...a DIRTEOMB thuds with loud PX on the chest of RONNIE who
SCREAMS as TIMMY spins; terrified and:

A HUGE FIGURE hurtles down out of the tree, smacking the
ground hard - painted face, sweat, a crown of thorns...

TWO MORE BOYS - JOEY WALSH and TOMMY .FINNELLI follow,
thudding to the ground, yelling war cries.

RONNIE, fallen to the ground, scrambles to get his Mattel
gun up but...

STEVIE is right on top of him, digging his plastic tommygun
right into RONNIE's face...he is a big frightening 10 year
old and he has blackened his cheekbones in a child’s

, version of an Indian warrior, and in an added touch of the
macabre, blackened all his teeth which now shine in a
twisted mouth of cruelty and certainty: '

_STEVIE'
You’re DEAD and you know it!

RONNIE looking up into that face as:
The blast of.the weapon goes off in RONNIE’s face.
STEVIE

Ronnie's dead!
RONNIE — looking up... _
HIGH ANGLES - THE WOODS - voice carrying...again i
‘VOICE
"Ronnie's dead!...Ronnie’s dead!"
EXT. MASSAPEQUA PARADE (1957) - DAY ‘ . ' 2
BOOM! - the huge sound of a BASS DRUM as CREDITS ROLL AND:
A NUBILE BLONDE with big cowboy boots and gigantic boobs and
long blonde hair BEATS her drum and 3
HORNS! MUSIC! and the BAND (marked the "Massapequa Long

Island High School Marching Band") tears into lohn Phillip
Sousa and-it's the Fourth of July and

.white, blue. ’An artillery attack over Massapegua and THE
'SUBTITLE READS: JULY 4, 1957. . .

v \
WHACK WHACK WHACK! The firecrackers blast off in red, ,
\

...and RONNIE rides the shoulders Of his DAD in a TRACKING
SHOT along the crowd, framed in such a way that we have the
impression RONNIE is floating above the crowd, ecstatic,
waving his red, white, and blue flag up at the crackers -
the greatest day of his life. ' -

' RONNIE; : 1
*Daddy, look at the firecrackers! ‘ ‘
Look! ' .

DAD is muscular, stocky, a kind face, late 30's, thinning
hair, looking up too: _

. DAD
'Hey look at that!

handsome woman, pregnant, with a somewhat tired face,

In the confusion of the crowd, now coming astride MOM - a
slightly pinched - also waving a flag.

With her 2 YOUNGER SONS and a DAUGHTER SUSANNE, 12. TOMMY, ‘
6, is pulling on DAD’s arm, jumping up and down. -

Come here Tommy.
RONNIE looking out from his perch at‘
A FLOAT OF AMERICANA (marked Massapegua USA) motoring down
Broadway. Young TEENAGERS populate-1t like strawberries.
Followed by:

THE NASSAU COUNTY MOTORCYCLE COPS - gleaming chrome and
black leather, the scouts doing wheelies on the back tires

_of their machines - crowd APPLAUSE.

MOM has caught TOMMY and spanks him hard on the sidewalk, a
quick flash of HYSTERIA.‘

MOM
What's the matter with you, don't
ya ever listen?.

TOMMY has the sullen eyes of the perpetual loser in these
quarrels. MOM slaps him up again on the buttocks.

MOM
Answer me! -

He stares stupidly at her, as if saying ’hit me again’ as

THE CLOWNS dance by behind and a 10 year old GIRL (DONNA)
whips up, stops, runs off again, chased by her FATHER. .

. v .‘ FATHER ,-
,'Donna! Come. back here...

THE DOVES (Massapequa Womenfs Auxilary) parade by in white
uniforms — the w1fery of one of the male organizations.

THE JUVENILE DELINQUENTS, 14-17, of MasSapequa look on, at

.an alienated distance, huddled with their CHICKS near a

”couple of souped-up convertibles, pointing and smirking at:

THE TOWN POLITICIANS in their cars waving.

TIMMY, dressed up in a Navy uniform, ducks and dodges
through the crowd, chased by

STEVIE, in an Army uniform with a COLLIE running and barking
at his side - nearly bowling over an OLD LADY who goes
"watch out!" and a FAT WOMAN foes "oooooh!"

RONNIE, now highlighted from a lower angle over his DAD by
1-2-3 fast background explosions of firecrackers (cherry
bombs, ashcans, sparklers). Hold. The moment broken by...

DONNA running up, extending her gift wrapped package,
excited. , , ‘

DONNA
Happy Birthday, Ronnie Kovic!

RONNIE surprised, as his DAD hauls him down to the ground.

RONNIE
For me?

DONNA
Yes. Open it!

He takes it shyly as his MOM notices.
MOM

Oh that's really nice of you Donna.
‘Say thank you Ronnie.

' ' RONNIE
(still surprised)
T’anks, Donna, but...

His BROTHERS huddle around him, now-joined by STEVIE running
up with TIMMY.

STEVIE
What is it, open it willya!

DONNA frowning at the interruption by the boys.

. DONNA
Leave him alone!
,RONNIE opening the box.‘
' ‘ . RONNIE
Boy...wow!'
STEVIE

(in awe) V
Hey it's the real thing
Ronnie...feel that!

RONNIE slipping a real $10 New York Yankees striped blue
wool hat over his head with the reverence of a priest
handling the crucifix...his eyes peering up from underneath
to assuage.the impact. '

-‘TIMMY
(hushed tones)
Just like Mickey Mantle Ronnie.

DAD snaps him up on the side of the head affectionately.

Boy. - .

a firecracker exploding above her eyes.

DONNA motions him with her head ~ come on. Slyly.

RONNIE, curious, sensing something new and important,
disentangles himself from his FRIENDS and goes up to DONNA.
Her lips glowing moist with a mischievous hint of lipstick.

' . DONNA
Let's sneak out.

‘ Her face. A pause. Ron will remember it forever. Mom with
RON

It’s a secret, Ronnie Kovic.

with puzzlement, fear, loss..;should it feel good or bad?

DONNA
.Did yOu like it?

RONNIE
I don’t know...I don’t know...

He’s scared, hides it by jumping up...

RONNIE

Why did the Russians beat us into

Moving to Dad feeding more coals in -- a.glow on his face.

DAD
Well, the Russians, they_don’t even
bother feeding their people, they
put all their money into making
weapons and things like that.

. RONNIE
But we’re supposed to be the best,
Dad?

DAD

You bet we are but we’ve been
pretty stupid too. We put the
Russians back on their feet after
,World War II and they took Hungary,
Poland, half of Europe -- and they
still want more...

- MOM
Communism is an insidious evil,
Ronnie, they don't believe in God
and if we don't watch out, they're
gonna take over this country ‘

"Let the word go forth from this
time and place, to friend and foe
,alike, that the torch has been

passed to a new generation of

Americans -- born in this century,

tempered by war, disciplined by a

hard and bitter peace,.proud of our

ancient heritage -- and unwilling .

KENNEDY -
"...in the lOng history of the
world, only a few generations have
been granted the role of defending
freedom in its hour of maximum
danger. I do not shrink from this
responsibility -- I welcome it. I
do not believe that any-of us would
exchange places with any other
people or any other generation."

JIMMY
Okay, Ronnie now, easy now, don’t do too much
at once, don’t go too far...

Obviously he is pushing the limit but he keeps on, and as he makes
a fast move, suddenly he COLLAPSES AND FALLS...a LOUD CRACK from
his leg like the branch of a tree breaking off.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- RON lying on the floor, puzzled. His right leg
twisted under him-at a curious angle, but he doesn’t feel a thing.
JIMMY runs over.

RON
0 fuck! What’s wrong!

SUBTITLE READS: SIX MONTHS LATER ‘

RON is in a circle electric bed with chest cast and broken leg
swollen to twice its original size, paler, weak and filthy looking,
unshaven. Two plastic tubes are attached to a BATTERED MACHINE
that keeps clanking and pumping loudly -- one tube running a clear
fluid into the leg, the other carrying a bright red out...‘

NURSE WASHINGTON comes over with Valiums and a cup of water.
Without warning, RON erupts angrily. - -

RON .
I’ve been_laying in my own shit for the last
three hours. I’ve been pushing my call
button and nObody comes. Why can’t I have a
bath? Why can’t the sheets be Changed in
this goddamn place, why can't the goddamn
vomgtlbe wiped off the goddamn floor once in
a w i e.

NURSE WASHINGTON
Don’t you raise your voice to me Mr. Kovic,
you watch your mouth.

Look at my leg! It’s twice as big as it ever
was!- When are you people gonna help me! I
wanna see the doctor now!

What’s eating you now Kovic, you going off
the deep end? -

: RON grabs the AIDE hard.

' RON '
FUCKING SHIT! 'What do I have to do to make
you people listen to me., I wanna be treated
like a fucking human being! .

He suddenly Slaps the Valium out of the NURSE'S hands.

RON
I don’t want this fucking-shit. You wanna
keep me drugged all the time so I don’t know
what’s going on. THIS PLACE IS A FUCKIN’

 

SLUM.

AIDE 2
We gonna amputate that leg you go on like
this. ' ,

RON

All I’m asking is to be treated like a Human
Being. (the AIDE chuckles). I’m a Vietnam
Veteran. I fought in Vietnam and I gotta
.right to be treated decently.

AIDE 2
Vietnam?- ...Vietnam don’t mean nothing to me
.man or any these other people. .You can take,
your "Vyet...Nam" and shove it up your ass!

 

Walks out, cackling.

Moving to RON -- an incredible pause. He’s about to do something
very violent, grasps the water pitcher to throw it when suddenly
the MACHINE next to the bed CUTS OUT (FX). He stops, worried.

Kicks it again harder. A RATTLE but no movement. RON freaking,

What's he doing! What’s he doing!

Please get the doctor willya, please
Washington. I don’t wanna lose this leg.
Please get the doctor! PLEASE. ‘

A YOUNG DOCTOR (THIRD DOCTOR) —- not seen before -- comes up,
optimism in his face. The SECOND AIDE and NURSE WASHINGTON are
ultra-polite now. - ' .

DOCTOR
How you doing Eddie, now let’s see what’s
wrong with this...

Checking the machine as RON waits, scared.

AIDE 2 _
Well, I tried to help Mr. Kovic, Doc.

RON, desperate, grabs the DOCTOR as he brushes the bed.

RON .

Look Doc, I'm trapped in this bed, I've been
here for six months. They’re telling me.if
they don't get this pump working, they're '
gonna cut my leg off. I want my leg Doc.
What do We do! What do we do?? First of

Taking note...people ceasing their labors on their front lawns and
casting curious looks, some from behind curtains, KIDS in the
street playing touch football, stopping...nothing seems to have
changed on the block except for automobile styles.

RON, his leg healed, into the wheelchair - though strong and
efficient, there is still a struggle to it, a tension, a hint of
saying ’let me do it, I can do it...you see,’ all overly polite.

RON
Wow, it's good to be back in the
neighborhood. Did you paint the house Dad,
everything looks different. Hey Major, come
here hoy...(a mutt coming over) Hey, I
haven’t seen you in a long time.

His DAD watching, calm as TOMMY, 18, comes up -- almost
unrecognizable from before with long hair, bare feet, a hippie
look. ,

_ RON
Hey Tommy, how ya doing. Wow you really got
‘big...I can hardly recognize you.

TOMMY
Hey Ronnie! Welcome back.

Hugging him. . ;

Wheels the chair forward himself as DAD tries to help, moving a few
feet up the lawn. A tension in the air, subtle as RON feels_
himself the center of attention and doesn’t want it, not now..
looking off at the NEIGHBORS watching. He turns back, shy..
pointing to the WOODEN RAMP leading from the lawn to the porch.

RON wheeling into his-old BEDROOM, TOMMY and DAD with him.

Not much has changed -- the mirror and crucifix, welcome home
cards, flowers, but depressing, cramped, harking back to another
age when the room seemed larger and filled with dreams.

DAD
(bypassing into the bathroom)
Fixed up a bathroom for you...put a wider
.doorway in...ramp...levelled out the shower
stall. (opening the stall).

Yankees hat Donna gave him.'

EXT./INT. BOYER’S HAMBURGERS - DAY (1969) , 56

A Fantasy. 'The Camera in semi-slow motion moving on the huge
figurine of a WOMAN, holding-a hamburger aloft... A Waltz on the
Muzak...stained cathedral Windows and plastic space balls hanging
from the ceiling shaped like hamburger planets... Microphone
orders... Signs, banners everywhere..."Win A Trip to Miami with
any purchase larger than $9.89"..."Free Baby Food -- Bring Your
Baby"..."Special Discounts for People Over 80"... '

...the WAITRESSES, all teenagers, moving in space costumes, their
names written in phosphorescence across their backs... The-mars
burger, the mercury, the venue, moon shot, space cakes... A place
one senses will never survive the late great madness of the ’60s
but for a time_there...you had to believe...

Over this march through the fantasy we hear young STEVIE BOYER’S
voice etching in the reason why.

:STEVIE
(over)

...It's part science part hunch_Ronnie -- I
-put up a place in Hapauge last year, no super
highway, no supermarket, the boonies right,
the heart of‘America... about eighty seats
right? No, I - say, I want 150 seats... My
operations guy yells at me, you’re crazy
Steve! ...I says to him, schmuck -- think
big! Stevie’s Golden Rule Number One -- the
Monotony Factor -- the higher the level of
monotony in a town, the more people want to
eat-and hang out. Rule Number Two -§ the
Expansion Factor 6- business always expands
to tax the facilities provided. Put two cash
registers in even if you only need one
now...put in 150 seats now, not 75.

And you'll see, you're challenging - the

grateful for your belief in them.. and
you’re even challenging the customer... The
proof: My Hapauge Boyer’s grossed 85 grand
last six months and now my competitor's
rushing in to build...but I was first and the
people always remember that. The people_are
loyal... _

...the camera now coming to rest on STEVE BOYER, showing RON
through his impeccable KITCHEN AREA, past white-aproned teenage
EMPLOYEES, the GIRLS in tight uniformed purple mini-skirts... We

“find him a self-assured, well—dressed (in late sixties mod)

executive fresh out of business school, puffed with the right edge
of prosperous baby fat, selling the dream to the bewildered RON..

yet he seems older than RON, as if RON missed a beat on his
generation...indicating a row of HAMBURGER PATTIES, all doughnut
shaped with holes in the middle, COOKS’ hands preparing them...

STEVE
You probably think this is just a hamburger
Ron...an’ you’re right. A patty is just a
piece of meat -- but-it can be a piece of
meat with character... See...here...? The
doughnut hole in the patty? My idea gets us
eighteen patties to the pound ’stead of
sixteen... Saves about 40,000 a year.

...moving towards another pair of HANDS stuffing the oatties with
condiments and covering it with a pickle...

STEVE .
...you plug the hole with lettuce, tomato,
chopped onion, spices, our secret sauce..
Cover the whole thing with a pickle, see..
here, try it...you don't see this at
McDonald’s on Sunrise Highway...got a
drive-in window_too. First.one in Long
Island!

-receiving the nicely packaged result.

STEVE handing RON his burger, eyeballing a YOUNG WAITRESS who walks
by in a tight mini. He leers after her...

STEVE
J..clean, cheap and fast. Feed the family
for $3.95. And check out those chicks,
