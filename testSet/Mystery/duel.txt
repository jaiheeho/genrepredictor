MOVIE OF THE WEEKEND

 

D U E L

ACT ONE

 

FADE IN
EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - HELICOPTER.SBOT — DAY 1

Behind titles, we see Mann's car (a low-power, economy model)
being driven along a twowlane, rural highway. No music; only
the faint sounds of his car motor and those of two widely

separated vehicles he passes which are going in the opposite
direction. Titles and.

MOVING SHOT — MANJ'S CAR 2

Camera drawing straight ahead of the car as it is driven along
the curving-back country highway. Camera starts to slow down
after several moments and the car moves closer until we see
Mann moreuclearly.

INT. CAR — ANGLE ON MANN 3

His suit coat off, his tie removed and shirt collar opened, his
sleeve cuffs folded back twice, a harness strap diagonal across
his chest. There is sunlight on his left arm and on part of
his lap. His hair is ruffled by the wind from the open window
at his left. He is humming softly with the music on the car
radio, the fingers of his right hand tapping idly on the steer-
ing wheel. Camera draws around him slowly, revealing a curv-
ing grade ahead between two high hills. Just visible, clinming
the grade, is a truck pulling a tank trailer. Camera moves down
to the speedometer, Mann is holding his speed at a steady 55
miles per hour. After several moments, camera pans to the
dashboard clock and holds. It is 11:31.

HELlCOPTER SHOT — MANN'S CAR 4

Camera shooting from the left and at a shallow downward angle.
Now the camera starts to pull ahead, drawing around so that
Mann's car remains in sight. After a while, the truck is re-
vealed foot by foot; a gigantic gasoline tanker truck pulling

a tank trailer, each of them having six wheels. It is not a
new rig but dented and in need of renovation, its tanks painted
a cheap looking silver color. We hear the grinding strait: of
the truck's motor. The vertical pipe to the left of the cab

is spewing dark smoke which clouds back across the traileru
Mann's car starts to close in on the truck and trailer.

5 INT. CAR w ANGLE PAST MANN 5

The truck trailer ahead, the distance between it and the
car narrowing. The word flammable is printed across the baCk
of the trailer, red letters on a white background. There
are parallel reflector lines across the bottom half of the
tank which look as though they have been clumsily applied
with a stencil. Swaying behind the rear tires are massive:

\ black rubber flaps. The license plate is a California issuE.

Mann starts to edge his car toward the opposite lane. He
steers back behind the truck with a faint sound of aggravation
as he sees a blind curve ahead. Some of the dark exhaust_
clouds across his car and he gets a whiff of it through the
open window, makes another sound, this one of distaste.

After several moments, he edges out into the opposite lane
again. The ridge ahead makes it too risky to pass. Mann makes
another sound, this of semi—amused acceptance as he pulls
behind the truck again.

6 HELICOPTER SHOT - TRUCK AND CAR 6

The trucktreaches the summit of the ridge and moves across it.
After a brief period, it starts around a left curve on the '
downgrade. Camera draWs around to reveal that no cars are
approaching from the other direction. Immediately, Mann's car
is accelerated and steered into the Opposite lane, gradually
passing the truck.

7 INT. CAR - ANGLE PAST MANN 7

Toward the back of his car. Through the rear window, we see the
truck, its front fenders a dingy purple color, the paint faded
and chipped. Mann glances at the rear View mirror, then steers
back into the proper lane, slowly increasing the distance
between his car and the truck. He starts to hum again, relax—
ing. Camera moves past him, stops, then angles down to reveal
his samples on the back seat.

8 ANGLE 0N MANN 8
We do not see the highway behind him. He starts to whistle
softly with the radio music, looking at the countryside
ahead.

9 POINT OF VEEW SHOT w COUNTRYSIDE 9

Distant ranges of mountains as far as the eye can see and, in
the immediate area, a valley ahead. o.s.

CONTINUED 9

We hear Mann's soft whistling. At the bottom of the grade,

the car crosses a concrete bridge and we hear the dull, popping
sounds of the bridge rails being passed. Camera down pans to
the speedometer. Mann has been driving down the last straight
portion of the grade at 67 miles per hour. We see the needle
move back as he slows to 55 and holds.

ANGLE PAST MANN 10

Camera shooting toward the right rear of the car so the high-
way behind is not visible. Camera moves in on Mann’s face as
he whistles. He looks toward the dashboard.

POINT OF VIEW SHOT — PHOTOGRAPH HOLDER ll

Attached byoa suction cup to the flat above the dashboard.
Camera moves in on the photograph of Mann's wife, seventeen-

year—old daughter and fourteen-year—old son.
E

BACK TO MANN 12

Sane angle as shot #19. He smiles to himself as he whistles.
he looks back at the highway, his eyes going out of focus.

A few moments later, the roar of the truck motor makes his
eyes snap back into focus and he looks to his left.

POINT OF VIEW SHOT - TRUCK l3

Passing in the next lane, camera draws back and around so that
Mann is included in frame and we see the truck and trailer
gaining ground, the passing of its bulk causing Mann's car to
shudder slightly. The truck has barely gotton by when its
driver cuts in for the proper lane. Mann makes a startled
sound as he is forced to brake to keep from getting too close
to the rear of the tank trailer.

MANN
Hey, what’s with you?

the windshield. -

Grimacing at the smell of the exhaust.

MANN
Oh, come on.

He glares at the truck.

MANN'S THOUGHT
Talk about air pollution...

He makes a hissing sound, then a pained one as another whiff
of truck exhaust assails him. He lets up on the accelerator
and slows down, looking at the truck, teeth gritted slightly.
Now he looks at the dashboard clock, winces. A

Camera on the left front fender, shooting toward Mann as he
edges out slowly into the next lane, looking ahead for signs
of appraoching traffic.

INT. CAR — ANGLE PAST MANN l9

Toward the highway ahead, the truck and trailer Visible on the
right. There is no oncoming traffic. Mann pushes down on

the accelerator and his car starts to pass the trailer.

Camera draws around to the left so that, as he begins to pass
the truck, we see its cab. It is too high for us to see more
than the truck driver‘s left hand on the steering wheel -*
darkly tanned and square~looking with large veins knotted on
its surface.

Camera ahead on the highway, far enough in advance so that we
cannot see the truck driver's face or Mann's. The car pulls
ahead of the truck.

INT. CAR - CLOSE ON REAR VIEW MIRROR 21

The truck's reflection gradually appearing in it. Camera
withdraws to include Mann as he pulls back into the proper
lane. He starts and looks up quickly at the mirror as the
truck driver gives him an extended horn blast.

The truck behind him in the distance. Mann looks down from
the rear View mirror.

INT. CAR - ANGLE PAST MANN ‘ 24

Toward the right front of the car. Off the highway is a slope
of shale-like earth with patches of scrub grass growing on it.
On top of the slepe is a clapboard house with a television
aerial on its roof which sags at an angle of less than 40
degrees. Mann makes an amused sound. A sign appears ahead,
printed in jagged black letters on a piece of plywood leaning
against a boulder: Night crawlers — bait. Mann makes another
sound of amusement.

MANN'S THOUGHT
'Night crawler?‘ (X)

Sounds like some monster in a low
grade horror movie.

ANGLE PAST MANN — TOWARD THE GAS STATION 227

Slowing down, Mann turns in and brakes to the left of the
pump island nearest the highway. Cutting off the motor, he
rubs his eyes and yawns, begins to stretch. The sound of the
truck motor behind his car makes him twist around.

POINT OF VIEW SHOT m TRUCK 28

Seen through the rear window, looming hugely, only the lower
portion of it visible as it is steered toward the right of the
island. Camera draws back and to Mann‘s left, turning with
him as he watches the truck stop beside the island with a
squeal of brakes, the trailer hitch paralled to his front
doors. Camera keeps turning with Mann's head until it is
shooting past him toward the cab of the truck. We see the
hand of the driver on the steering wheel.

ANGLE PAST MANN " TOWARD RIGHT REAR OF CAR 29

Mann looking toward the truck cab with a slight curiosity.
He starts, looking upward, as the 0.5. attendant bangs once
on the roof.

ATTENDANT'S VOICE
Yessir!

Mann jerks his head around at the sound of the man's voice,
camera drawing around to the left to include the skinny, cheery
looking Attendant leaning over by the window, smiling in at
him.

ATTENDANT
What can I do you for?

Mann draws in slightly ragged breath.

MANN
Fill it with Ethyl, please.

ATTENDANT _
will do - if Ethel don't mind. W

He moves toward the rear of the car, whistling happily. Mann
smiles a little painfully, then looks toward the cab of the
truck again.

Beneath it the legs of the driver can be seen. He is wearing

faded pants and nondesoript shoes. Camera pans as he moves to

the middle set of tires. Camera draws back to include Mann.

He looks toward the window as the 0.5. attendant speaks.

ATTENDANT'S VOICE
Check under the hood for ya? (X)

MANN
(Please.

He looks to the front.’ In the b.g., the truck driver‘s legs
move out of sight.

ANGLE ON CAR 33

Mann sitting in profile, staring ahead, not really anxious
but not comfortable either. Camera starts to draw back.
After several moments, we see the attendant by the open hood.
He looks at Mann.

ATTENDANT
Looks like you could use a new
raddiator hose.

MANN’S THOUGHT
(drily)
Where have I heard that one before?

MANN
(smiling)
I'll get one later.

ATTENDANT
You're the boss.

Camera keeps withdrawing until we see in full shot how the.
truck and trailer dwarf Mann's car. In relative size, it is
akin to seeing a tug boat beside an ocean liner.

As the attendant tears off Mann‘s receipt and hands it to him

with his credit card, camera drawing back to reveal Mann as
he takes them.

ATTENDANT
You save them stamps?
MANN
No, thank you.
He turns on the motor.
ATTENDANT

Good enough.

Mann lets off the emergency brake and starts to drive away
from the station.

ATTENDANT
Come back now!

I .
As Mann steers back onto the highway — looking across his
shoulder to make sure it's clear - we see the truck through
the rear window, parked by the gas pump island. Mann picks
up speed.

WIFE‘S VOICE
(sadly chiding)
Why do you always turn down stamps,

Dave?
MANN * s THOUGHT (x)
Cause you always make me lick them.
He grins.
ANGLE DOWN HIGHWAY — TOWARD GAS STATION 35

Mann‘s car approaches camera and drives past, moving out of
frame. Camera holds. Down the highway, the truck and trailer
pull away from the gas station, move onto the highway and
approach camera. There is a glare of sunlight on the wind—
shield and we cannot see the driver's face. The huge truck ,
moves into close f.g., passing camera, filling the screen.

INT. CAR - CLOSE ON SPEEDOMETER 36

The needle steady at 55. Camera draws up and back to include
Mann, angling to reveal the highway and terrain ahead. After
awhile, the sound of the truck motor begins impinging on the
sound of the car motor and Mann glances at the rear View
mirror, reacting to what he sees.

The truck overtaking it rapidly. Mann alternates worried
glances between the rear View mirror and the highway ahead.
He starts to speed up, is disturbed at being forced to do
so and begins to slow again. The truck, moving faster and
faster, turns out into the Opposite lane. Seeing that the
truck driver is determined to pass, Mann slows down further.
Camera draws around to Show the leviathan shape of the truck
passing on the left. Mann throws an irritated glance at it.

MANN'S THOUGHT
What are we having, a contest?

Camera keeps moving around Mann, following the movement of the
truck. No sooner has it passed than the driver angles toward
the proper lane. Mann makes a sound of incredulous surprise
as he lets up sharply on the accelerator pedal to keep from
being sideswiped.

MANN
What‘s with this guy?

I
The truck pulls on ahead, then shows down. Mann has to
decrease his speed even more. The odor of the truck‘s exhaust

reaches him again and, with an angry mutter, he starts cranking
up the window to his left.

As he finishes cranking up the window, looks at the clock.

music pulsing faintly o.s. Mann tugs down several paper

and he cries out as his upper teeth gouge into his lower lip.
His face contorts as the right end of the car begins surging
to the right. He starts to jerk the steering wheel to the
