Winter’s 2nd Revision
September 12, 2004

DARKNESS. The soft rumble of a motor idling the only sound.

MARCUS (v.o.)
I read a story once where a man
walked into hell and the only way
he could get out was by not lookin'
back when he left. Turned out
temptation got the best of him and
he fucked it all up, had to stay
there forever. Well I was born in
hell and I'll tell you one fuckin'
thing. When my time comes? I
ain't lookin’ back.

We HEAR the KA—CHACK of a clip being jammed into a pistol and
on screen appears:

SOUTH JAMAICA - QUEENS, NEW YORK

EXT. CHECK CASHING STORE ~ JAMAICA AVENUE — NIGHT

Late. Quiet. Run-down neighborhood. A stolen Suburban
idles near a Check Cashing store, lights on but gates down,
closed for business. PAN the Suburban's bumper—sticker: “My
Child Was Student of the Month at Garden City Middle School!"

INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN — CONTINUOUS

The occupants: five African—American males and a Guest.
In the driver's seat is KERYL, 23. Next to him sits ROMEO,
18, who tokes on a huge spliff, a Glock .9mm in his lap.

KERYL
C'mon, lemme get that shit.

Romeo passes the joint to RAMA, 23, Southern accent, who
holds another .9mm —— In the back, MARCUS, their 25 year
old leader, holds an Uzi. In between him and TYRELL, 22,
sits RODRIGO, a trembling Colombian-about 30.

MARCUS
(to Rodrigo)
One more time Iﬂma run this down.
We gettin' out this car, we gonna
walk to that side door. You gonna
knock the code, you ain't gonna say
a motherfuckin' word. Comprende?

RODRIGO
Si. Yes. Please no shoot me.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 2.

MARCUS
That’s up to you, motherfucker.

Marcus presses the Uzi against Rodrigo's temple, leans in:

MARCUS
Try any shit I'll paint that store
with your fuckin' brains.
(then; to the others)
Let’s do this.

As they all pull ski masks down over their faces...

INT. CHECK CASHING STORE * NIGHT

A chain—smoking KOREAN MAN, 50s, sits at a table, counting
machine WHIRRING as it spits out stacks of HUNDRED DOLLAR
BILLS. Nearby, two KOREAN WOMEN tie the stacks with bands.

Across the room, a Colombian GUARD watches a Tony Robbins
infomercial on TV. A few beats, then a coded knock on the
side door. RAP. RAP. RAP—RAP—RAP. The Guard approaches the
peephole, his .45 pistol still in its holster.

GUARD'S POV THROUGH PEEPHOLE — Rodrigo stands outside, holds
up a Nathan's bag. As he unlocks the door...

GUARD
Fuck you been, I'm starvin' inw—

BAMMMMlll The door kicks in violently, knocking the Guard
backward nearly off his feet. The Korean Women SCREAM,
throwing up their hands as Marcus a Co. pile in.

MARCUS
Fuckin' move I‘ll blow your fuckin'
heads off!

In a flash, Bama is on the Guard, .9mm jammed in his eye.
He quickly takes the .45, forces the guy to his stomach as
Tyrell shoves Rodrigo to the floor next to him.

While Romeo covers the Women, Marcus produces a nylon duffel
bag. Workmanlike as the Grinch, but ten times faster, he
fills it with the cash. As he loads the money:

KOREAN MAN
Goddamn cocksucker!

TYRELL
Shut the fuck up!

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 3.

At the table, Marcus cleans out the counting machine, shoving
the bills into the duffel bag. Bama nudges the Korean Man.

BAMA
Where the rest at?

KOREAN MAN
That all, no more!

ROMEO
(glancing at his watch}
Sixty secondsl

MARCUS
A—ight, we done.

BAMA
Puck‘s the rest of the money?!

MARCUS
We got what we need, let’s go!

BAMA
Lemme grabs the Lottos.

MARCUS
I said let*s——

Just then, another Colombian GUARD appears in the front
doorway, raises a sawed—off shotgun...

KA—BLAMMM!!! A huge hole is blown in the wall inches from
Bama's head. With the Women screaming, Bama holds his
shattered eardrum as Marcus sprays the Uzi at the Guard,
taking him out. Marcus shoves the duffel into Romeo's hand.

MARCUS
Gol! Goll

As Romeo bolts off, Tyrell covers the room while Marcus grabs
Bama, carrying him out the door with one arm.
EXT. DARKENED STREET — NIGHT

In panic mode, Romeo sprints to the Suburban, tosses the
duffel in. Marcus rushes up holding Bama, Tyrell following.

KERYL MARCUS
Fuck happened in there?! Help me get him in!

Romeo and Tyrell help Marcus lift Bama, pile in after him.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 4.

MARCUS
Drivel! Go!! Go!!

As they screech off, SIRENS blare in the distance and we...

CUT TO:

A CHERRY TOP LIGHT —— spinning wildly, flashing in the dark.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal it‘s on an AMBULANCE that
screeches down the Van Wyck Expressway. On screen appears:

1976

INT. AMBULANCE — NIGHT

MARCUS (v.o.)
I was born in 1976, same year as
the Bicentennial.

Laying on the gurney is KATRINA, 15, pretty, African—American
and very pregnant; she moans loudly, in full labor. Her
MOTHER, 40s, holds her hand as a PARAMEDIC checks her vitals.

KATRINA
It hurts! Ohhh! Motherfucker!!

MOTHER
I did it nine times, baby, I know.

And as Katrina continues moaning...

MARCUS (v.o.)
The little girl on the gurney's my
moms. She's fifteen years old.

INT. KATRINA'S BEDROOM — NIGHT

A cramped room; Stevie Wonder & Charlie's Angels (the TV
show) posters on the wall, clothes everywhere. With her
three SISTERS asleep nearby, Katrina lays awake, staring at
a mirrored disco ball hanging from the ceiling.

MARCUS (v.o.)

I never knew for sure who my pops
was — she never really talked about
him at all. She always told me I
was the immaculate conception.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 5.

Suddenly the disco ball starts glowing; a bright, other—
worldy light fills the room, reflecting off Stevie Wonder‘s
sunglasses. It washes down over Charlie's Angels, alighting
Katrina’s face as she sits up in bed.

MARCUS (v.o.)
I guess I liked that better than
the truth, which was probably that
he was some no—account nigga from
the hood.

INT. TACO BELL — DAY
Katrina, now 19, scoops meat into a row of taco shells.

MARCUS (v.o.)
It didn’t really matter anyway —
with my moms around, I didn't need
no dad. See most girls her age
woulda gone on welfare, let the
government pay their ass, but
Katrina Philips wasn’t about
that shit.

INT. TACO BELL — BACK ROOM — NIGHT

Katrina punches her time card, opens her pay envelope,
glances at the check — $89.00. She frowns slightly.

MARCUS (v.o.)
She assessed her options, tradin'
fast food for fast money.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — QUEENS — DAY

Katrina, 22 and blinged—out, leans into a Monte Carlo full of
-white COLLEGE GUYS. The DRIVER hands her a $20; she slips
him a foil packet of coke. As he pulls away, Katrina heads
back to her spot on the corner, sips a Sprite. Further up
the block, a hard—looking hustler we'll come to know as
TOPCAT, 28, gives her a subtle nod.

MARCUS (v.0.1
Time she was twenty two, she had
her own house egg a brand new Buick
Regal —- for me, every day was
Christmas with my moms.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 6.

EXT. TOYS 'R US — PARKING LOT — DAY

Marcus, now 8 and wearing a thick gold chain, running suit
and bright white sneakers, holds an armload of toys as he
follows Katrina toward a a shiny black '84 Buick Regal.

MARCUS
Can we go to Carvel?

KATRINA
{checks her beeper)
I gotta make a stop first, baby.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — QUEENS — DAY

With rap music on the radio, the Regal sits parked at the
curb, Marcus in the passenger seat playing with a "Mr. T"
A—Team action figure. Nearby, Katrina stands arguing with
SLIM, rail thin, Geri—curled, 205. Topcat, the hustler we
met earlier, mediates.

KATRINA
Nine times I told this motherfucker
stay on his side the boulevard!

SLIM
You own this fuckin' street?
Opportunity knocks, I take the
sale, bitch.

KATRINA
{lunges at him)
Who you call bitch, motherfucker?!
Katrina Slaps and scratches at Slim; he tries to fight back.
TOPCAT SLIM
Whoa, whoa! Don't push me, girl — I will
fuckin’ beat your ass!

Topcat separates the two of them.

TOPCAT
Chill now, fuck you doin'?! You
don‘t do that shit out here!

KATRINA
Lionel Richiemlookin’ motherfucker.

Topcat gives them hard looks. Things calm down, then:

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 7.

TOPCAT

Here’s how it's gonna be. Trina
works the south side of Brewer

and you stay the fuck 'cross the
street.

SLIM
Bitch be pickin' my pocket.

TOPCAT
(reaching for his gun)
Fuck I just say motherfucker?

Topcat stares him down, ice—cold eyes. A few beats, then:

TOPCAT
Now get your bony ass back there.

Slim shoots Katrina a look, then crosses the street.

. KATRINA
Pussy ass nigga.

TOPCAT
Take it easy. Everybody gonna eat.

Topcat looks over, notices Marcus sitting in the car.
He crosses to him, leans inside, smiles.

INT. KATRINA'S REGAL — CONTINUOUS

TOPCAT

Hey lil’ homey, who you got there?
MARCUS

Mr. T.
TOPCAT

Mr. T?! I ever tell you ’bout the
time I whupped his ass?

MARCUS
You buggin'. Mr. T is bad.

Topcat smiles, pats Marcus’ head as Katrina gets in the car.

KATRINA
I’m droppin’ him off, I'll be back
later.

TOPCAT

Time's money, Trina.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 8.

Topcat crosses off. Katrina settles in. Marcus is quiet.

KATRINA
Y’all right baby boy?

MARCUS
Why was you fightin' with that man?

KATRINA
Who, Slim? He was tryin' to take
somethin’ belonged to me baby, and
you can't let people do that. You
gotta be strong.

MARCUS
I don’t like when people fight.

KATRINA
What you worried about? Don’t you
know I’d never let nothin' happen
to you? Look at me, baby.
(off his look)
I will always protect you.

MARCUS
I know.

KATRINA
C'mon now, let's get some Carvel.

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE — LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Now in pj's, Marcus sits on the couch eating Carvel ice cream
with six other BOYS and GIRLS ranging from age 12 to 25.

MARCUS (v.o.)

Though Katrina had her own crib,

a lot of time I stayed with my
grandparents and my eight aunts
and uncles —« shit, some of them
niggas weren’t much older than me.

UNCLE SPORT, 17, and GRANDPA attempt to hook up a new VCR.

UNCLE SPORT

You plugged it in output. You
gotta use input.

GRANDPA
Shut your ig'nant mouth 'for I
input my boot up your ass.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 9.

The CAMERA DRIFTS to THE FOYER, where Katrina and Marcus'
Grandma, now 503, are in the midst of a hushed argument.

GRANDMA
He don’t need Your money, Katrina,
he needs you.

KATRINA
He got me. I’m here, ain’t I?

GRANDMA
And when you go get yourself in
jail, then what?

KATRINA
I ain't goin‘ to jail, will you
stop sweatin‘ my ass?

GRANDMA
Don’t you use that lang—-

Katrina looks, noticing something. Grandma turns to see what
it is — Marcus is watching them. They trade looks. A truce.

GRANDMA
Marcus, say goodbye to your mama.

Marcus approaches. Katrina kneels down, smiles.

KATRINA
I'll see you Saturday, okay, baby?

MARCUS
Can we get the Atari?

KATRINA
I told you we could, didn't I?
(off Marcus' smile)
Now gimme a kiss.

Marcus kisses his mother; she hugs him, exits.

EXT. KATRINA'S HOUSE - LONG ISLAND — NIGHT

Late. Katrina pulls the Regal into the driveway of a neat
ranch style home on a quiet suburban street.

MARCUS (v.o.)
Turned out I never did get that
Atari —— Katrina didn't show up
that Saturday.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 10.

INT. KATRINA'S HOUSE — LONG ISLAND — NIGHT

Katrina enters the foyer, flips on the light. And as soon as
she closes the door...

SLIM APPEARS from behind it, slipping an electrical cord

around her throat. Knee in her back, he YANKS violently on
the cord, lifting her off her feet. Katrina flails wildly,
kicking, scratching, eyes bulging. Slim tightens his grip.

MARCUS (v.0.)
That was the day they found her
body.

EXT. KATRINA'S HOUSE — LONG ISLAND — DAY

A few KIDS on bicycles look on as two UNIFORMED MEN from the
Coroner's office remove Katrina‘s corpse in a body bag.

MARCUS (v.o.}
Just like that, my mom's life
ended. Life as I knew it ended too.

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE — LIVING ROOM — DAY

Near a meager Christmas tree, the family sits around in robes
and pj's, looking on as Marcus unwraps a few simple presents.

MARCUS (v.o.) .
With my grandpa on disability and
eight other kids to feed, shit like
Atari was a thing of the past.

Marcus opens a gift - a bag of small green plastic Army Men.

EXT. ROCKAWAX BOULEVARD - DAY

Bookbag over his shoulder, Marcus walks to school past
boarded—up storefronts; garbage, broken glass everywhere.

MARCUS (V.O.)
In addition to me, that summer
there was another new arrival in
Queens —— crack swept through like
a hurricane. Some folks said it
was the worst thing ever happened
to the hood...

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 11.

SIRENS in the distance, Marcus side-steps a filthy, pregnant
CRACK HO, who stands with a few other emaciated FIENDS.

MARCUS (v.o.)
Some said it was the best.

A HUSTLER drives by in a gleaming ‘85 Bonneville, dripping
with gold jewelry as rap music BLARES from his stereo.

EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL — DAY

The BELL rings; KIDS pour out of the graffitieoovered school,
including Marcus and CAMERON, a skinny kid in glasses about
his own age. In contrast to Marcus’ hand—me—downs, Cameron
is well dressed, wearing a brand new Starter jacket.

CAMERON
...then Rambo grabs the Chinese
dude and hits him like powll

MARCUS
Who, the first dude?

Across the street, some older KIDS hang out smoking, boom—box
cranked. Their ringleader, KENNETH, a scary—looking, light—
skinned, redheaded bully about 13 spots Cameron.

KENNETH
Yo, yo, Cameron. Hold up!
CAMERON MARCUS
(nervous) (to Cameron)
Nah man, I gotta go home. Who that?
KENNETH

Yo, lemme holla at you a second!

CAMERON
Run Marcus!

Marcus and Cameron take off running. Kenneth starts Chasing
them, but can’t dodge the traffic to cross the street.

KENNETH

I catch you little nigga that
jacket is minel

EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE v STREET w DUSK

Marcus and Cameron sit quietly on the curb, carving their
names in the blacktop with nails.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 12.

CAMERON
You ever think about your moms?

MARCUS
I dunno, sometimes.

CAMERON
Shit‘s messed up.

Marcus half-shrugs. A few beats, then:

CAMERON
Wanna play Skelly?

MARCUS
Okay, lemme get my cap.

They stand. Just then, the street lights come on.

CAMERON
Aww, man.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Cameron was a rarity in the hood, a
kid with somethin' almost no other
kid had — a moms and a dad.

Across the street, CAMERON‘S FATHER, 35, pokes his head out
of the screen door of a small, neatly-kept house.

CAMERON'S FATHER
Cameron!

CAMERON
I know. See you tomorrow, Marcus.

Marcus watches as Cameron crosses the street and goes inside.

MARCUS (v.o.)
Every night when that street light
came on, it was time for Cameron to
go in. I hated that fuckin’ light.

EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE — STREET — NIGHT

Marcus stands alone in the deserted street, throwing rocks at
the street light’s bulb.' After a few tries with no success,
he sits, takes a small plastic Soldier from his pocket. He
plays with it a bit, then after a while starts talking to it:

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 13.

MARCUS
What 'chu worried about, man?
You gotta be tough. Don’t you
know I‘ll always protect you?

Marcus sits alone, the sound of SIRENS in the distance...

EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL — SCHOOLYARD — DAY

In the garbage—strewn schoolyard, rap music plays from a
nearby boom box. Marcus looks on with a few other KIDS
as a GIRL break—dances on a piece of cardboard.

KID #1 ' KID #2
Pop—lock like you did before! That shit crazy.

Just then, outside the fence, a commotion. Marcus looks,
sees Cameron surrounded by the bully Kenneth and his boys.

KID #1
Oh snap, Cameron in trouble now.

As Kenneth tries to yank off Cameron's jacket, Marcus reaches
in his pocket. He squeezes the plastic Soldier, then
purposefully strides across the schoolyard onto the street.

KID #2
Where you goin’, Marcus?

MARCUS (v.o.)
Growin’ up in the hood it's a
constant battle to get nice things.

Barely missing a step, Marcus grabs a loose six-inch piece
of concrete from the sidewalk around a tree.

MARCUS (V.O.)
It's a bigger battle to keep 'em.

Marcus approaches Kenneth, whose back is to him as he roughly
yanks off Cameron's starter jacket.

MARCUS
Hey!

Kenneth turns and... WHAMMMM!! Marcus SMASHES him across
the face with the concrete. A gash immediately opens over
Kenneth's eye, blood pouring down his shirt as he goes down.

MARCUS
Touch him again I will fuck your
ass up! All you motherfuckers!

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 14.

Kenneth crawls to his feet, runs off. His gang suddenly gets
very quiet. Marcus stares them down — no one has the balls
to challenge him. He leads Cameron back to the schoolyard...

MARCUS (v.o.)

Over the next few years, I made
a reputation for myself with the
other kids. And in the hood,
reputation is the cornerstone

of power.

EXT. ROCKAWAY BOULEVARD — DAY

Marcus, now 12, walks down the street. He stops to look in
the window of "Value World Shoes", where a sharp— looking pair
of Adidas’ is on display with a price tag of $75.

MARCUS (v.o.)
The problem with a reputation's
you gotta live up to it. And it's
hard lookin’ fly wearin’ Pro
fuckin' Keds.

Marcus looks down at his own ratty sneakers and heads off.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

A dejected Marcus walks down the street, which is dotted
with crack HUSTLERS and FIENDS. On the corner, looking
like a million bucks, Topcat leans on his '88 Caddy Seville,
smooth»talking a neighborhood HOTTIE. As Marcus passes by:

TOPCAT
Yo, how you doin’, b.g.?

MARCUS
I'm a—ight.

As the Hottie crosses off, Marcus approaches Topcat.

TOPCAT
Look at you, all growed up. So
what’s happenin', brother?

MARCUS
I dunno. Goin‘ to school.

TOPCAT
Educate thyself, your mama'd be
proud. So you need anything?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 15.

MARCUS
Nah.

TOPCAT
Ah, see now you lyin’ to Topcat.
Everybody need somethin’.

MARCUS
(shrugs; shy)
Tryin’ to hold some Adidas’.

TOPCAT
Sneakers, that all? Shit, I'll
have you rockin' sneakers egg some
new gear.

EXT. QUEEN’S PLAZA MALL — DAY

With Marcus in the passenger seat, Topcat pulls the Seville
into the mall parking lot, rap music thumping.

MARCUS (v.o.)

There’s two sure ways to get a

kid to do somethin'. Take away
what they already have or give

’em somethin’ they want.

INT. QUEEN'S PLAZA MALL — MONTAGE

In a shoe store, Marcus tries on new Adidas'; Topcat pays in
cash from a thick wad. Another store; Marcus picks out a
Starter jacket, matching hat. In a jewelry store, Marcus
reluctantly picks out a gold chain; Topcat nods it‘s okay.

MARCUS (V.O.)
You wanna make friends, givin'
somethin' they want works a whole
lot better.

INT. MCDONALD'S — DAY

Nearly empty. Eating a Big Mac, wearing his new clothes,
Marcus sits across from Topcat, who smokes, but doesn’t eat.

TOPCAT .
Tell you man, your moms? That
there was a special lady. And
smart? Shit. She loved your
ass too, you know.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 16.

MARCUS
I know.

TOPCAT
(a few beats; then)
Like your new threads?

MARCUS

You trippin'? They great.
TOPCAT

Tell you what... nah, forget it.
MARCUS

What?
TOPCAT

Nah, you too young.

MARCUS
No I ain’t, what?

Topcat feigns that he’s thinking it over, then "caves".

TOPCAT

A—ight, but only cause your moms
was a friend of mine. Instead of
you askin’ for fish, how you’d like
if I give you a pole instead?

(off Marcus' confusion)
What I'm sayin' is how'd you like
to be able to buy all this shit
yourself. Matter fact, how you'd
like to be able to buy anything
you want?

MARCUS
Shit yeah.

Topcat looks around, then leans in.

TOPCAT
Here’s the thing then, man to man.
You know what crack is, right?
(off Marcus’ nod)
Well you should never ever do that
shit, it fucks you all up. But
long as there’s other niggas stupid
enough to do it, why not turn that
to your advantage?
(looks around; pulls
out a vial)
See this little shit?
(MORE )

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 17.

TOPCAT (cont'd)
You can stand on Brewer thirty
seconds, sell it to a fiend for ten
dollar.

MARCUS
Ten dollar for that?

TOPCAT .
Tell you what else. He got the
paper, that same fiend gonna come
back in two hours buy another.

MARCUS
Shit.

TOPCAT
(smiles; then)
A—ight, here‘s I’ma do, I‘ma hook
you up, give you a tryout.

TOPCAT
(holds up vial)
We go back to Brewer, I'ma give
you five of these. Every four
you pump for me, you pump one for
yourself, keep the money. That's
a ten dollar profit.

MARCUS
Whoa.

TOPCAT
This a big opportunity little man,
you sure you can handle it?

MARCUS
Hell yeah.

And as Marcus and Topcat shake hands, we FREEZE FRAME:
MARCUS (v.o.)
From that moment, I was addicted to
crack. Not doin' it —— sellin’ it.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

As Topcat looks on from down the block, 12—yearwold Marcus
stands amidst a few other Hustlers ranging from age 16 to 25.

MARCUS (17.0.)
Every afternoon from three to six I
was out on the street.

untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12104 18.

A gypsy CAB pulls up; the PASSENGER waves Marcus over.
He approaches, trades crack for cash; the Cab pulls off.

INT. GRANDMA‘S HOUSE — KITCHEN — DAY

CLOSE ON A CLOCK — 6:12 p.m. Marcus enters, passing Grandma,
who smiles at him as she makes spaghetti.

MARCUS 01.0.)
I told my grandma I joined some
bullshit after—school program.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD - DAY

Marcus is on the street; a shaky FIEND, 203, approaches with
a handful of crumpled—up singles.

MARCUS (v.o.)
Most hustlers wouldn't take
singles, but me, I’d take fuckin'
pennies that’s all a fiend had.

INT. BOYS' BEDROOM — BASEMENT w DAY

Using a phone book to lean on, Marcus uses a steam iron to
neatly press a stack of bills into crisp, flat notes.

MARCUS (v.o.)
I got so obsessed with money I used
to iron the bills out, count how
much I had over and over and over.
INT. BOYS' BEDROOM — BASEMENT n DAX
Marcus sits on the bed, finishes lacing up his old pair of

Pro Keds. He grabs his bookbag, exits.

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN — DAY

Marcus enters the kitchen, says goodbye to Grandma, who
serves Grandpa waffles at the table.

GRANDMA
Got your chess club today, baby?

MARCUS
Yeah, till six.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 19.

GRANDPA
Boy a genius.

Marcus exits.

MARCUS (v.o.)
The fucked up thing is for all the
green I was holdin‘, I couldn't let
my grandparents know about it.

EXT. CAMERON‘S HOUSE - BACK YARD — DAY

As Cameron acts as look—out, Marcus slips off his Keds, then
pulls a Hefty bag out from behind the garage.

CAMERON
Come on Marcus, hurry.

From a small selection of brand new pairs of sneakers, Marcus
removes a pair of snow white Adidas' from the bag.

MARCUS {v.o.)
I stashed my real sneakers over
behind Cameron's garage.

And as he starts changing his sneakers...

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — NIGHT

Marcus and a few other Hustlers stand around a boombox, which
blares NWA. One of them, a scary, droopy—eyed thug we'll
come to know as JUNEBUG, 16, bops his head to the music.

MARCUS 07.0.)
It was right around this time I
first got into rap. I mean once
NWA dropped they shit, every nigga
I knew was rhymin’.

JUNEBUG
Yo, you feelin‘ this shit?

MARCUS (v.o.)
For the first time we heard music
that truly reflected our lives...

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Marcus and Cameron make their way down the street, passing a
Hustler who raps as a few others look on.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 20.

MARCUS (v.o.)
Hustlers, fiends, even little kids
wanted to be rappers. Me and my
friends'd fuck around in the yard,
write our own verses.

EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL — SCHOOLYARD — DAY

Marcus, Cameron and a few other 5th GRADERS look on as one of
them, LEONARD, raps to a tired, old—school beat.

LEONARD
My name is Leonard and I‘m here to
say/That I'm the best rapper in the
world today...

MARCUS (v.o.)
The difference was I took it
serious, actually worked at it.

EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL — SCHOOLYARD —

The same KIDS are gathered near Marcus, who raps to a beat.
He's colorful, clever and very talented, but way too hardcore
for a 5th grader, with lyrics about crack, murder and pussy.

A TEACHER walks by on her way into the school, overhearing
Marcus as he raps. And on her appalled expression...

MARCUS (v.o.)
But much as I liked rappin’, it
was sort of just a hobby —— nothin'
gave me a rush like makin' money...

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Marcus, now 15 and wearing new Clothes and jewelry, works the
street. Nearby we see Junebug, now 19, in a tense discussion
with a THUG in a Yankee's cap.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Not that hustlin' didn't have its
down—side. There was fierce
fuckin' competition.

A strung—out WOMAN pulls up in a car; Marcus and two other
Hustlers race to make the sale.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 21.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — NIGHT

With other Hustlers nearby, Marcus sells to Kenneth, the
schoolyard bully, who now has a scar over his eye.

MARCUS [V.O.}
Plus there was always the poupo to
worry about.

HUSTLER (o.c.)
Five—0!!

Kenneth runs off. Marcus bolts behind a parked car, ducks
down as a POLICE CRUISER passes by.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD _ DAY

Marcus sells to a Fiend. Nearby, talking on a pay phone is
the THUG in the Yankee’s cap.

MARCUS (V.O.)
But your biggest problem was one
you might not even know you had...

A rusty Nissan rolls to a stop. As casually as if he's

buying a neWSpaper, Junebug emerges from the back, walks to
the Thug in the Yankee cap...

MARCUS (v.o.)
Beef with another nigga.

BLAMl BLAM! BLAM! BLAME BLAM! SLAM! BLAME BLAME BLAME

Junebug empties a Glock into YANKEE CAP'S body, finishing
him off with three head shots. As blood pools on the
sidewalk, Junebug locks eyes with Marcus, then jumps back
in the Nissan, which screeches off.

MARCUS (v.o.)
It‘s some fucked up shit, but as
they say, no risk, no reward. And
by the time I was 15, I had more
“reward" than I could hide.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

AS Marcus, Junebug and a few other Hustlers look on from down
the street, Topcat stands talking to a shifty—looking, gold—
toothed hustler we'll come to know as ODELL, 27.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 22.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Cash, jewelry, I even had my own
Kawasaki I'd ride to school every
day. But all that shit was nothin'
compared to what some niggas had.

In SLO—MO, a midnight blue Rolls Royce pulls over near Topcat
and Odell. From up front step twa hard—looking gangstas in
their 205 —— MAJESTIC, shaved head, and BREEZE, dreds. They
look around, then open the rear door for LEVAR CAHILL, late-
30s, dressed from head to toe in leather and diamonds.

MARCUS (V.O.)
In the New York coke trade, not
even the Colombians were bigger
than Lever Cahill.

As Majestic and Breeze look on, Levar greets Topcat and
Odell, who smiles broadly, flashing his prominent gold teeth.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Fuck, that nigga was the New York
coke trade, the gangsterest nigga
there was.

HUSTLER #1
Whoa, check that fuckin' ride.

JUNEBUG
Rolls ain't shit. Bentley, that's
my fuckin' car.

Just then, from down the block:

TOPCAT
Marcus! Yo Marcus!

Topcat waves Marcus over. He starts over, tentative.

. JUNEBUG
Oooh, look at this nigga. Fresh
off the step, now he hangin' with
the big dawgs.

Marcus approaches nervously. Levar turns to Topcat.

. LEVAR CAHILL
Who this little nigga?

TOPCAT
You remember Trina, right?
(off his confusion)
meal

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 23.

LEVAR CAHILL
(flash of recognition)
Oh yeah, right. Right.

TOPCAT
This here her baby boy.

LEVAR CAHILL
Word?

Levar smiles broadly, looks Marcus over approvingly.

TOPCAT
Little nigga move more weight than
five of these other motherfuckers.

ODELL
True dat, boy a worker bee.

From down the block, Junebug looks on, clearly jealous at the
attention Marcus is getting from the big man.

LEVAR CAHILL
So you out there grindin’, makin’
me money?

MARCUS
Yeah, I... You like a God to me,
Mr. Cahill.

LEVAR CAHILL
_ (smiling broadly)
Like a God? Little nigga I'm
God, Buddha and motherfuckin'
Allah rolled into one.

EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL — DAY
Marcus pulls up on his motorcycle, parks it outside.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I went home that night in a daze, I
mean meetin’ Levar Cahill was like
meetin' a movie star, even better.

We see a makeshift cardboard license plate as Marcus takes
his backpack and heads off toward the school entrance.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I still wasn’t thinkin' straight
when I left for school next day.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 24.

INT. PUBLIC SCHOOL — DAY

STUDENTS wait on line to go through a metal detector, placing
their bags on a table to be searched. Marcus approaches.

SECURITY GUARD
Bag.

Marcus hands over his backpack. The GUARD opens it, pulls
out a notebook, gym clothes, a pair of hi—tops with rolled up
socks stuffed inside. He pulls out the socks — and out spill
a dozen CRACK VIALS. Marcus looks as shocked as the Guard.

MARCUS
Oh fuck.

EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL — LATER

As a few TEACHERS and STUDENTS look on, a COP leads a
handcuffed Marcus to a waiting POLICE CAR.

MARCUS (V.O.)

The truth is I wasn’t sneakin'
that shit inside, I never hustled
at school. I had hid it in there
weeks ago and forgot all about it.

INT. COURT - DAY

Marcus, head bowed, stands with his LAWYER before a JUDGE as
Grandma and Grandpa look on from the spectator section.

LAWYER
It’s a first offense, your honor,
he’s fifteen years old. He was
holding it for a friend.

JUDGE

(thinks a beat; then)
He'll pay a fine of five hundred
dollars and I'm recommending he be
suspended from school for two
Weeks. And Mr. Philips?

(off Marcus' look)
If I ever see you in my courtroom
again you will go to jail.

Marcus nods, crosses with his Lawyer to his Grandparents.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 25.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I know this sounds twisted, but
I blamed gettin' caught on my
grandparents. Way I saw it, if I
didn't have to hide my shit, this
never woulda happened.

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Marcus sits on the couch across from his Grandparents.

GRANDPA
Is that What you wanna be, a damn
disgrace?!

GRANDMA
A boy your age, Marcus. And you
have such intelligence.

GRANDPA
What about your future?

They keep talking, but we can‘t hear them at all.

MARCUS (V.O.)
For a kid in the hood, the future's
the shit you see in Star Wars.
Shit, most niggas I know catch a
bullet way before they're 30, so
what kinda future is that?

TOPCAT (V.O.)
(game show host voice)
So here‘s the deal...

INT. GAME SHOW SET — FANTASY SEQUENCE

On the set of "Let’s Make a Drug Deal”, Marcus stands with
Tepcat, who's dressed and acts like a cheesy game show Host.

TOPCAT
You can stand on the corner, hustle
crack and have enough money for a
Mercedes in six months...

Topcat nods toward his lovely game Show ASSISTANT, in bikini,
heels and fur as she fawns over a Mercedes 4505L.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 26.

TOPCAT
Or you can bust your black ass,
go to college for twelve years and
maybe have enough left over for a
down payment on a Ford fuoking
Escort.

Topcat gestures to his other ASSISTANT — a fat, middle—aged
HOUSEWIFE gesturing to a shitty Ford Escort.

 

TOPCAT
So what‘s it gonna be Marcus, door
number one, the Mercedes, or door
number two, the Escort?

THE AUDIENCE is packed with YOUNG BLACK MALES.
AUDIENCE MEMBER #1 AUDIENCE MEMBER #2

You crazy nigga?! Number One! Get that coochie tool
one! .

BACK TO MARCUS, who stands with Topcat thinking it over.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Not much of a choice, is it?

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — BEDROOM - DAY

With his back to the camera, wearing a brand new track suit,
Marcus finishes dressing, lacing up his sneakers.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Truth is getting caught did do me
some good.

CLOSE ON his hands as he puts on some jewelry.
MARCUS (V.O.)
Now that it was all in the open,
it forced me to decide who I was
and who I wanted to be.
He clips a beeper on his waist, slips a .380 in his pocket.
MARCUS (V.O.)

At the end of the day, all things
considered...

The adult Marcus, 18, turns and looks directly INTO CAMERA.

 

MARCUS
I'm a fuckin' hustler, baby.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 27.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Softly rapping to himself, Marcus stands at his designated
spot on the street, a few other Hustlers up the block.
(NOTE: Whenever possible, we should see Marcus rapping

to himself out of habit, the way some people hum.)

MARCUS (V.O.)

With my purpose in life now Clear,
I moved out my Grandma’s and quit
school —— now I could be on the
street all day.

A Toyota Celica pulls over. Marcus runs to it, leans in the
window. The driver is a shaky white BUSINESSMAN, 30s.

BUSINESSMAN
Let me get two purple tops.

MARCUS
Buy four, I give you five.

The Businessman nods. Marcus makes the sale.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD _ {LATER THAT) NIGHT

The street is crowded with traffic. Marcus makes a sale to a
FIEND, five others lined up behind him.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Fuck, it was busy I’d grind all
night, wouldn‘t even go home to
sleep.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD ~ (THE NEXT) MORNING

Dawn. Marcus, still in the same clothes, dozes on a bench,
the only hustler on the street. The same white BUSINESSMAN
pulls up in the Toyota. Marcus makes the sale.

MARCUS (V.O.)

I was master of the fast flip.
I’d buy three and a half grams
from Topcat...

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — DAY

In boxers and strapless T, Marcus watches ”New Jack City" on
video as he fills purple—tepped vials with crack rocks.

Cook it, bag it up and pump it.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Hot. Summer. The street is packed with cars, Hustlers,
Fiends and regular PEOPLE just hanging out.

MARCUS (V.O.)
There was Antwan, a sharp—dressin',
ball—breakin' nigga from Harlem...

ANTWAN, slick, well—dressed, 16, leans in the car window.

ANTWAN
Yo son, you buyin' or drivin’ round

me over to suck my dick or did you?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 29.

MARCUS (V.O.)

ROMEO
Hey girl, you fine, you know that?

MARCUS (V.O.)
Keryl, a fat little nigga who
talked more shit than Don King...

KERYL, 16, fat, leans in the car window.

KERYL
Fuck dawg, I got whatever you need.
All these other niggas come see ER
when they need they shit.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Finally there was my boy, Tyrell.

TYRELL, 13, muscular, leans in the car window.

TYRELL
What up yo, how you doin’?

MARCUS (V.O.)
Straight up, dependable, my second
in command.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — NIGHT

Marcus and the Crew stand together looking INTO THE CAMERA.
Each holds a stack of fanned—out CASH in his hands.

MARCUS (V.O.)
This was my dream team — my
brothers » five niggas dedicated
to one thing and one thing only ——
gettin’ paid.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT « KITCHEN — NIGHT
Pouring rain; thunder. In the living room, Romeo channel-

surfs, smokes a joint. At the table, Marcus raps to himself
as he, Tyrell and Antwan play dominoes for money, drink 40s.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 30.

ANTWAN
C’mon nigga, will you go ’for

(beat; then to Marcus}
Will you stop fuckin’ singin' 30’s

MARCUS-
Boo—yahll

Strategize my dick you dumb—ass

TYRELL
You knew shit, motherfucker.

A KNOCK at the door. Marcus crosses, looks out the peephole.

KERYL
It's me yo, open up.

Marcus opens the door. Keryl stands there, soaked from head
to toe. The guys SCREAM with laughter as he enters.

ANTWAN
Look at this Free Willy
motherfucker all wet s— I told

KERYL
Fuckin' rainin' out, motherfucker.
Yo, you hear about Levar Cahill?
Got his ass arrested, yo.

MARCUS
Oh, fuck.

TYRELL
What's this fuckin' mean?

The Crew all looks to Marcus.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 31.

MARCUS (V.O.)
What it meant was Levar was goin’

away... but that didn't mean for a
second he wouldn’t still be runnin'
things.

EXT. CHELSEA PIER — MANHATTAN — DAY

Under a sign reading "Bon Voyage Levar", dozens of Hustlers
and their scantily—clad GIRLFRIENDS board a huge party boat.

MARCUS (V.O.)
The big question was who'd take
over his day—to—day —— and my
man Topcat seemed like the
logical choice.

INT. PARTY BOAT — NIGHT

The packed boat cruises the Hudson River, the lights of
Manhattan glistening behind it. Music, dancing, Cristal
flowing, tuxedo—clad WAITERS serving giant shrimp. Off to
the side of the dance floor, the camera finds

MARCUS ,

champagne in hand as he takes in the opulence. Nearby, a
very sharply-dressed Topcat nuzzles his GIRLFRIEND'S neck as
Odell, the gold—toothed Hustler, talks to some other PLAYERS.

TOPCAT
(playful; biting her neck)
Tonight is the night, baby.

Topcat’s GIRLFRIEND giggles. Just then, the Crowd parts.
Levar approaches with his bodyguards Majestic and Breeze.

LEVAR CAHILL
(to Topcat; as they hug)
Get a room motherfucker. Manhattan
ain’t but a quarter mile away.

TOPCAT
Yo g, it ain’t too late. You want
I'll get this motherfucker turn
this boat around, drive it straight
to motherfuckin‘ Africa.

LEVAR CAHILL
And live over there with them
jungle niggas? I'll Q2 my time.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 32.

They all laugh. Levar winks at Marcus, then:

LEVAR CAHILL
Y'all know Majestic, right?

TOPCAT MARCUS
Yeah, yeah. What up, b? 'Sup.

MAJESTIC
My nigga Breeze.

Breeze just nods. Levar looks over toward the DJ, gestures
for him to cut the music. The CROWD groans.

DJ
All right yo, simmer down, our
guest of honor wanna holla at
you a bit.

As the Crowd hoots and hollers, Levar crosses the dance
floor, Guests patting his back as he goes. He takes the mic.

LEVAR CAHILL

Y’all havin' a good time?

(the Crowd screams)
What?! All them niggas back in
Queens can’t hear y’all!

(they scream louder)
How 'bout them niggas in Brooklyn?

(they scream even louder)
Fuck them Jersey niggas, who give a
fuck about them.

(the Crowd laughs)
On the real though, we all know
why we’re here and that's to say
goodbye to my ass.

GIRL IN CROWD (0.5.)
We love you Levar!

LEVAR CAHILL
I love y'all, too. Main thing
though's even though I'm gone, I‘ma
always be around in spirit. And
just to make sure y'all don't
forget that, I'm appointin' someone
to remind y'all...

Marcus looks at Topcat, Odell and the other older Hustlers,
all looking on in anticipation. Topcat breathes in, squeezes
his Girlfriend's hand. Clearly he thinks he’s the one.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 33.

LEVAR CAHILL
Majestic, c'mon up here, son.

The Crowd goes WILD as Majestic crosses the dance floor.
Topcat and the others do their best to hide their emotions,
applauding with everyone else, but clearly they’re pissed.

MAJESTIC
(into mic)
Hey yo, what up, how y’all doin‘?
Let's give it up for Levar...

Marcus looks at Topcat, doing his best to hide his anger.
And as Topcat stalks.off...

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

With Junebug working down the street, Marcus is in mid—sale
to a Fiend as he talks to Tyrell, Antwan and Keryl.

a paper bag on the coffee table in front of him.

He downs it, pours another. Sits back on the couch.

MARCUS

of them Land Rovers.

TOPCAT
Big ride for a little nigga.

You know I'm the one taught your

TOPCAT
Parkin' lot there at the beach,
Riis Park. We'd go out there in

EXT. CHECK CASHING STORE - DAY

A line of neighborhood PEOPLE, welfare checks in hand,
stretches clear out the door.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Best days were the first and
fifteenth when the checks came in.

As FIENDS emerge, cash in hand, they join another line around
the corner... the one to buy crack from Marcus and Tyrell.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Not that it was all easy. See
when you work the street, it's
jungle rules...

With his crew nearby, Marcus stands on a corner. Across the

Fuck you doin’, that's my sale.

JUNEBUG
Get out my face, Rig——

POW! Marcus punches Junebug in the mouth, knocking him down.

JUNEBUG
(reaching for his gun)
Motherfucker! I'ma cap your ass.

Marcus kicks him in the face, then jams a .9mm in his cheek.

MARCUS

How you gonna do that? You gonna
take on all of us?

Junebug looks up — Tyrell, Romeo, Keryl and Antwan stand
aiming guns at him. Junebug deflates. As Marcus takes his
gun and rifles his pockets for money, a BMW pulls to the
curb, Breeze driving, Majestic next to him.

stumbles off, a Fiend approaches. Marcus makes a sale...

MARCUS (V.O.)

the cash I needed to be somebody.

INT. CAR DEALERSHIP — SHOWROOM — DAY

As a SALESMAN waits on a CUSTOMER nearby, Marcus, looking
like a high school senior with a knapsack, circles a ’94 Land
Rover. He spots SALESMAN #2 walk by with some brochures.

The guy ignores him, continues on his way. Marcus frowns,
looks at the clock m 2:20 p.m.

As Jackie continues his call, Marcus approaches the desk,
unzips his knapsack. He turns it upside down —— dozens of
rubber—banded stacks of CASH spill out. Jackie looks at the
money, stunned. He hangs up the phone, looks at Marcus.

. JACKIE
What'd you say, a Land Rover?

EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP — DAY

They all toast. Just then, a commotion at the front door.
Marcus and the guys look over to see DARIUS CLAY, 30s,
wearing heavy gold chains and a leather pork—pie hat. As
he enters with a small entourage, the CROWD swarms him.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 42.

MARCUS

Fuck, check it -- Darius Clay.
KEISHA

Who?
ANTWAN

You fuckin’ serious?

MARCUS
Nigga's one of the biggest record
producers in the world.

The music continues as Darius disappears into the crowd.
After a while, the DJ takes the mic.

DJ
Y'all ready for some free-style?
(the Crowd cheers)
Aight, let's give it up for
Dangerous.

Marcus watches a GANGSTA RAPPER (Dangerous) take the stage,
start free—styling. His face changes as the CAMERA PUSHES in
on him -— does he wish it was him up there? He looks over at
Darius Clay, who’s taking in Dangerous from a table across
the way. After a beat, Marcus starts to head off.

KEISHA
Where you goin' baby?

Marcus crosses off to the men's room...

INT. MEN’S ROOM — NIGHT

Marcus finishes taking a leak, then crosses to the sink,
where another GUY is washing his hands. They finish, reach
for a towel at the same time, look up at each other...

CAMERON
Marcus?

MARCUS
(as they hug) -
Cameron! Shit, what up, doe,
whatchu doin' home?

CAMERON
Spring break, you know. Here with
some people from school.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 43.

MARCUS
Come sit by us, VIP.

INT. CLUB STARLIGHT — LATER

As Darius watches another RAPPER free—style lame gangsta
shit, we PAN TO THE VIP SECTION. Cameron has now joined the
group, but Keisha is over at the bar.

MARCUS
This here was my fuckin' nigga,
yo. Math class, algebra and shit?
I copied everything off his ass.

CAMERON
You would've done some work, you
might’ve passed on your own.

MARCUS
I know how to count nigga, that's
all the math I need.

ANTWAN
(toasts with champagne}
I heard that.

Just then Tyrell approaches, leans in to talk to Marcus.

TYRELL
Lemme get your keys, yo.

MARCUS
Where you goin'?

TYRELL
Nowhere, back seat, man, this bitch
over there itchin’ to go.

Marcus looks — a really HOT GIRL busting out of spandex waits
at the edge of the VIP section. Marcus hands over the keys.

MARCUS
Make sure that jimmy nice and
tight, you bust a nut on that
leather you gettin' the whole
fuckin’ thing detailed.

Tyrell chuckles, takes the keys, exits with the Girl.

DJ
A—ight, give it up for Chilly TE

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04

Moderate applause for the lame GANGSTA RAPPER.

KERYL
Chilly T. This nigga sucks.

ANTWAN
Whyn't you rock the mic, then?
Call yourself Chili Fries.

KERYL
Fuck you, nigga.

They all laugh. Cameron turns to Marcus.

CAMERON
You still rappin‘?

MARCUS
I dunno, not really. Fuckin'
around.

ROMEO

Fuck that, you can't shut this
nigga up half the time.

CAMERON
Like when we were kids.

LEILANI (0.5.)
Cameron, we're leavin'!

44.

Cameron looks over —— on the dance floor, LEILANI, 19, stands
with a few other college students including CHARLENE, a very
pretty neighborhood girl the same age; Marcus checks her out.

CAMERON
Hold up, I gotta get my coat.

MARCUS
Who the fuck is that?

CAMERON
It ain't like that, she’s just a
friend from school.

MARCUS
(re: Charlene)
No, no, the one in the blue dress.

CAMERON
I don't know, her friend. Great
seeing you, man.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 45.

MARCUS
You too bro, don't be a stranger,
call a nigga.

Cameron nods, crosses off with Leilani to get his coat.
Marcus approaches Charlene, pulls her arm.

MARCUS
Where you goin‘, it's early.

CHARLENE
It’s two o'clock in the morning.

MARCUS
Not everywhere. Shit, in Hawaii
it's probably only lunch time.

CHARLENE
(thinks a second; then)
Actually it's dinner time in
Hawaii, but unfortunately we're
not there.

MARCUS
I could make that happen real quick
if that’s where you wanna go.

CHARLENE
I‘m going home to sleep.

MARCUS
So I'll come by, help you relax.

CHARLENE
Thanks, but I don’t play that.

MARCUS
Where you from, 'round the way?

CHARLENE
Paisley Houses.

MARCUS
Project girl.

CHARLENE
Not for long, I got plans in life.

MARCUS
That‘s cool. So lemme get your
number, I'll hit you up.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 46.

CHARLENE
Look, you're very cute, okay, but I
have a boyfriend.

MARCUS
You got a boyfriend, where is he?
You was my girl I'd be right there
at your side.

CHARLENE
He's away at college.

MARCUS
College? Girl I could teach you
more in one night than he'll learn
in fifty years of college.

From across the dance floor, Leilani calls out.

LEILANI
Charlene, come on!

CHARLENE
I really have to go. Can I have my
arm back, please?

MARCUS
Hold up, c'mon, how I get to see
you again?

CHARLENE
Close your eyes and dream?

Charlene crosses off. Marcus stares after her as if he's in
a trance. Keisha approaches, notices him looking.

KEISHA
Who the fuck is that bitch?

MARCUS
Get off my dick.

Marcus turns his back on her, heads back to the VIP section.

EXT. CLUB STARLIGHT — (LATER THAT} NIGHT

Over the sounds of moaning, the Land Rover is rocking,
windows fogged as Tyrell fucks the Hot Girl from the club.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 47.

INT. LAND ROVER — BACK SEAT — CONTINUOUS

Out of breath and sweaty, Tyrell pulls his pants on as the
Girl finishes straightening herself out.

TYRELL
Damn girl, I knew you was a little
fuck machine soon I saw you.

HOT GIRL
You fucked me so nasty, baby.

TYRELL
Well gimme your number, I'll come
by do it again. You ready?

The Girl nods. Tyrell opens the door, steps out and...

EXT. LAND ROVER — STREET w CONTINUOUS

GANGSTA #1
Out the fuckin‘ car nigga!

GANGSTA #1 grabs Tyrell, jams a .9mm against his head. As he
shoves him to the street, the Hot Girl screams, runs off...

GANGSTA #2
Where’s the fuckin' keys?!

TYRELL
I... my... my pocket.

GANGSTA #1
Give it up, motherfuckerl

As Tyrell fumbles for the keys, Gangsta #2 looks around.

GANGSTA #2
Fuck it, just do this nigga, c'mon!

And just as Gangsta #1 raises his gun to Tyrell’s head...
SLAM! BLAME SLAM! BLAME Shots ring out from behind.

It's MARCUS, approaching, blasting away with his .380, his
Crew behind himzreaching for their guns. Gangsta #2 takes
off as Gangsta #1 fires back, hitting ANTWAN in the head.
He goes down, bleeding.

KERYL
Fuckll

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 48.

Marcus keeps firing, then Gangsta #1 takes off running too,
disappearing up the street. As Keryl helps Antwan, Romeo and
Marcus runs up to Tyrell, still on his knees.

MARCUS
It’s okay, yo, you're all right.

ROMEO
(to Marcus)
Yo man, I know them fuckin‘ niggas!

Marcus turns to Keryl, hovering over Antwan.

KERYL
Call a fuckin' ambulance!

MARCUS
Fuck that, get him in the car.

As a crowd of Patrons gather from the club, Keryl and Romeo
load Antwan into the Land Rover, blood pouring from his
wound. And as the rest of the Crew piles in, Marcus takes
off, police SIRENS in the distance...

MARCUS (V.O.)
We took Antwan to a hospital in the
Bronx, told ‘em he got shot by a
group of niggas tried to rob him...
he died the next day.

EXT. ST. JOHN'S CEMETERY — QUEENS — DAY

A few dozen MOURNERS stand near a coffin as a PRIEST reads
from a bible. Marcus & the Crew fight back tears.

MARCUS (V.O.)

Much as we tried to hide it, losin’
our boy hurt like hell. And in the
hood, when someone hurts you...

you fuckin‘ hurt them back.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - (LIVING ROOM) NIGHT

Still in their funeral clothes, Marcus, Romeo, Tyrell and
Keryl sit around drinking.

ROMEO
I’m tellin' you thems was Rockaway
niggas, I seen 'em over there.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 49.

MARCUS
There it is then, we roll on up.
KERYL
Who gonna do it?
MARCUS
I will.
TYRELL

Fuck that, them niggas is mine.
Pull me out the car like that?
Shit. Just get me a clean gat.

MARCUS (V.O.)
When you roll with a crew, you
gotta be willin' to die for each
other. You gotta be willin' to
kill for each other too.

EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - QUEENS — NIGHT

Late. Quiet. A group of four GANGSTAS, including the two
from the attempted jacking, stand bullshitting on a corner.
A stolen Honda Accord cruises by unnoticed, Tyrell at the
wheel, Marcus next to him, Keryl and Romeo in back.

INT. HONDA ACCORD — NIGHT

TYRELL
That’s them, right there.

ROMEO
I told you motherfuckers.

KERYL
Pull over, pull over.

MARCUS (V.O.)
A few nights later, we found them
niggas at the projects in Rockaway.

Unseen by the Gangstas, Romeo pulls over in front of a parked
MOVING VAN about 30 yards up the street. Marcus produces a
Glock .9mm, hands it to Tyrell, who looks around nervously.

TYRELL
You sure this is cool?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 50.

MARCUS
It's cool, yo. You take this get,
you walk up real slow, keep it at
your side. You get up close...

Marcus notices Tyrell is trembling. A beat, then:
MARCUS
Fuck it, you know what? Lemme Show
you how to pop these niggas.

And before anyone can say a word, Marcus is out of the car.

EXT. HOUSING PROJECT — QUEENS — CONTINUOUS

Quiet and calm, Marcus walks toward the Gangstas as the Crew
looks on from the Honda. As he gets within ten feet:

GANGSTA #1
Hey yo, what up? Who you here——

SLAM! BLAM! BLAME BLAM! BLAM! BLAME BLAM! SLAM! SLAM! BLAM!
Marcus empties the clip into the Crowd; the Gangstas go down,
writhing, screaming. As he calmly walks back to the Honda:

MARCUS (V.O.)
If I didn't have the respect of my
crew already, I sure as shit did by
the time I got back in that car.
From that moment on, they knew I‘d
never ask them to do anything I
wouldn't do myself.

INT. HONDA ACCORD — CONTINUOUS

Marcus gets in. Tyrell and the others look at him, stunned.

MARCUS
You wanna drive, motherfucker?

Romeo snaps out of it, puts the car in gear and pulls off.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY
Marcus and the Crew stand outside working the street.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Nobody fucked with us after that...

Untitled 50 cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 51.

INT. TOPCAT'S APARTMENT — KITCHEN a DAY

Marcus sits at the table laying out dozens of bundles of
CASH. Topcat enters with three kilos of coke.

MARCUS (V.O.)

We was ridin’ high...

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM _ DAY

With a few Hotties hanging with them, Marcus, Keryl, Tyrell
and Romeo put crack into vials, watching "Scarface” on DVD.

MARCUS
Makin' mad fuckin‘ money.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

With the crew nearby, Marcus leans in the window of a Dodge
Caravan, sells a few vials to a huge black guy with a goatee.

MARCUS (V.O.)
We were pumpin' hard all day...

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — BEDROOM — NIGHT

With the sounds of a party out the window, Marcus fucks the
shit out of a neighborhood HOTTIE.

MARCUS (V.O.)
And pumpin’ even harder at night...

EXT. MARCUS' APARTMENT BUILDING — POOL AREA — NIGHT

A wild party is in progreSS; music, forties, food. GIRLS are
everywhere, many topless, splashing in the pool.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Before long, the whole crew was
livin‘ in my building. It was like
havin’ our own fuckin' castle ——
and I was the king.

As the CAMERA PANS the group, we find Marcus in a lounge
chair, the HOTTIE he was just fucking massaging his
shoulders. Romeo approaches with a shopping bag.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 52.

ROMEO
Yo, check this out.

He removes an Uzi from the bag.

MARCUS
Fuck, where you get this?

ROMEO
Nigga K—Dog, two hundred dollars.

Just then, Marcus“ beeper goes off. He checks it, gets up.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT w KITCHEN — NIGHT

Marcus stands at the counter mixing a drink as he finishes
dialing his cell. In the living room, Keryl and Tyrell check
out the Uzi while Romeo starts grinding with a GIRL.

MARCUS

(into phone)
S’up, it's me.

EXT. MERRICK BOULEVARD — NIGHT
Topcat sits in a red BMW, talks on his cell.
TOPCAT
Drop what you doin’, meet me down
Merrick, we takin' a ride.

INTERCUT MARCUS AND TOPCAT

MARCUS
When, now?

TOPCAT
Fuck I just say?

Topcat clicks off. Marcus hangs up, looks at Romeo, now
making out with the Girl on his couch. As he exits:

MARCUS
Take that bitch down your own crib.
Fuckin' stink up my couch?

EXT. ACE AUTO BODY — LONG ISLAND CITY — NIGHT

A deserted, industrial area. Topcat and Marcus pull up in
the BMW. Several other luxury cars are already there.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 53.

MARCUS
Puck's this shit?

TOPCAT
Damn if I know.

INT. ACE AUTO BODY - NIGHT

Topcat and Marcus enter the huge garage, where Majestic,
Breeze and about two dozen other HUSTLERS are waiting.
Breeze pulls down the gates, locking them all inside. The
Hustlers exchange wary looks. Majestic scans the group.

MAJESTIC
So I know y’all are askin' yourself
what the fuck's goin' on here —~
I'd be askin’ myself that very
same question.

Majestic paces among the group. It's very tense.

MAJESTIC
See the thing's this —— when you
work for McDonald's, you can't buy
your burgers from White Castle,
right? Now why is that?

Majestic stops at a nervous—looking Junebug.

JUNEBUG
Ain’t part the same company.

MAJESTIC
See even though you might get a
better deal buyin’ from White
Castle, in the long run it fucks
everybody in the franchise, you
feelin‘ me?

Majestic scans the group. They nod.

MAJESTIC
See right there then, that‘s why we
here. One of you motherfuckers
been buyin' from White Castle.

Majestic looks at them, lingers on Tepcat. We play the
tension, then he motions for the group to follow him. In
the next room, hanging from the chains of a ten—ton auto
body straightener, is the horribly beaten and bloodied
ODELL, duct tape over his mouth. Breeze crosses to him.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 54.

MAJESTIC
This nigga Odell been in business
for himself, buyin’ his shit from
the Colombians instead of us.

Breeze yanks the piece of duct—tape from Odell’s mouth.
He starts blubbering, crying, gold teeth flashing.

ODELL
No man, that ain‘t how it is,
please listen to me: Please!

BREEZE
(backhands him)
Shut your fuckin‘ mouth!

Majestic approaches. Odell sobs like a baby.

MAJESTIC
Far as I’m concerned, you owe these
niggas here a whole lot of money.
Now how you gonna pay it back?

ODELL
(crying; sobbing)
I’ll do whatever you say, tell me,
man! Please, I'll do it! Pleasel

As Odell sobs, Majestic looks at Breeze. Together they do a
well—rehearsed routine for the benefit of the Group.

MAJESTIC
What we gonna do, how this nigga
gonna pay these gentlemen back?

BREEZE
How ‘bout he pay ’em in gold?
MAJESTIC
You right, motherfucker, them shiny—
ass teeth!
ODELL
Noll Noll Pleasell

As the Group exchanges looks, Breeze crosses to a tool board,
methodically chooses a pair of 11—inch diagonal pliers. He
approaches Odell, who screams, wriggling on the chains...

ODELL
Noll Noll

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 55.

WHAMMll BreeZe punches Odell square in the face, jamming
the pliers into his mouth. As he grips a tooth, we hear a
sickening CRUNCH through Odell’s screams. Breeze yanks hard
on the pliers, pulls a bloody gold incisor out of Odell's
head by the roots. Odell SCREAMS in agony.

BREEZE
Relax nigga, you only got but ten
more ’fore I put that bullet in
your brain.

Breeze jams the pliers in again. And as Odell SHRIEKS in
agony, the CAMERA FANS the group, settling on Marcus.

MARCUS (V.O.)
If you play with fire long enough,
you will get burned.

EXT. MARCUS' APARTMENT BUILDING — DAWN

Topcat drops Marcus off at the curb. He crosses to the front
door as the BMW pulls off down the street.

MARCUS (V.O.)
And in the crack game, heat comes
in many forms.
INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT BUILDING — LOBBY — CONTINUOUS

Marcus opens the lobby door. And as soon as he steps inside:

DEA AGENT #1
Freeze! Hands in the airll

Marcus is slammed against the wall, spread—eagled. The lobby
is swarming with DEA AGENTS, guns drawn.

MARCUS (V.O.)
The first thing I thought was they

knew about Odell, but that shit
just happened like an hour ago.

DEA AGENT #2
Hey asshole, remember me?

Marcus turns around. DEA AGENT #2 looks familiar...

FLASHBACK - A SERIES OF STILL B&W SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 56.

CLICK. Marcus on the street. CLICK. Marcus leans into a
Dodge Caravan. CLICK. He exchanges crack for money. CLICK.
The Driver is DEA AGENT #2, the huge, goateed black guy.

BACK TO SCENE
Marcus is handcuffed.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Turned out this had nothin' to do
with Odell —— they had a warrant to
search my crib.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT “ LIVING ROOM - DAY

A handcuffed Marcus sits as the DEA AGENTS ransack the place,
emptying contents of drawers on the floor. On the coffee
table are 2 ounces of cocaine, cash and a dozen crack vials.

MARCUS (V.O.)

Lucky for my ass I was light on
product and didn't have too much
incriminatin’ shit lyin' around.

DEA AGENT #3 (0.5.)
Look what I found. Locked and
loaded.

AGENT #3 emerges from the bedroom with Romeo's loaded Uzi.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Incriminatin’ shit of my own,
that is.

And as Marcus is led off, we see his toy plastic Soldier
among the debris on the floor.

INT. COURTROOM — DAY

Wearing a suit and tie, Marcus stands with his LAWYER before
a female JUDGE, who reads from a piece of paper.

JUDGE
Mr. Philips, you are hereby
sentenced to a term of no less
than three years in a Federal
penitentiary.

The Judge bangs her gavel. Marcus turns to face his weeping
Grandma, who sits with his Grandpa and the Crew.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 57.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I guess there’s no such thing as a
good time to be goin‘ to jail, but
this shit was fucked.

INT. PRISON - DAY

Wearing an orange jumpsuit, carrying his prison—issue blanket
and toiletries, Marcus is led past the cells.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I had had it all and lost
everything.

The mostly black INMATES hoot at him from behind bars.

INMATE #1
Ooohhh, look at this little niggal

INMATE #2
Whatchu do boy?!

MARCUS (V.O.)
Worst of all they sent me to Ohio,
where I didn't know a fuckin' soul.

Marcus enters a cell, sits on a cot across from a sleeping
INMATE. The door closes behind him with a heavy CLANG.

INT. PRISON MESS HALL — DAY

Bustling; lunch time. Marcus sits alone eating, a few extra
salt packets on his tray.

MARCUS (V.O.)

The thing about prison’s that
everything’s a test. Niggas read
you, then they try you.

As Marcus eats, an inmate in a red SKULL—CAP approaches.

SKULL CAP
Yo man, I get some of that salt?

MARCUS (V.O.)
Someone asks you for somethin',
even if they friendly about it?
Bullshit, they sizin' you up.

The guy reaches for a salt packet. Marcus knocks his hand
away, stands up.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 58.

MARCUS
Fuck off, motherfucker.

The hall goes quiet; INMATES look over to see how this will
play out. A brief stare—down, then Skull Cap crosses off.

MARCUS (V.O.)
First it's your salt, then it’s
your food, next thing you doin‘
some nigga's laundry.

Marcus sits down, goes back to his meal.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Whatever you do, you gotta send a
message, nip that shit in the bud.

EXT. PRISON YARD — DAY

INMATES lift weights, play basketball. Off in a corner, the
camera finds a twitchy, crazy—looking inmate we'll come to
know as BAMA, 21, doing dumbbell curls, HOWLING like a wolf
as he does. Nearby, Marcus does pull—ups, ignoring him.

ACROSS THE YARD Skull Cap and three other Inmates watch
Marcus from around a weight bench. One of them hands Skull
Cap a shiv, which he slips under a towel. Very casually, the
group crosses toward Marcus, whose back is turned as he does
pull—ups. Bama, the howler, senses what‘s happening. As
Skull Cap nears Marcus:

BAMA
Watch your back, nigga.

Bama HOWLS as Marcus drops off the bar, sees SKULL CAP charge
him with the shiv. Skull Cap SLASHES, catching Marcus in the
shoulder with the blade, but Marcus side-steps, SLAMS his

fist into Skull Cap's face, taking him down. As Marcus beats
the shit out of Skull Cap, one of his Crew charges in, but...

BAMA
{howling like a wolf)
Ow—ow—oooooowwwwllll

WHAMMMll Bama slams a dumbbell across the guy’s head, taking
him out. And as the other Crew Members charge, Bama joins
the fight, swinging the dumbbell wildly, holding them off
with Marcus. And as GUARDS swarm in...

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 59.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Though my shoulder was out pretty
bad, in the end it was more than
worth it. Word spread quick that I
wasn't someone to fuck with.

INT. PRISON — MEN’S ROOM — DAY

Marcus mops the filthy floor. At the other end of the room,
Bama mops also.

MARCUS (V.O.)
What I couldn't figure out was
this crazy motherfucker.

Marcus works his way near Bama. They work in silence, then:

MARCUS

Why'd you help me, man?
BAMA

I don't know. I like fightin‘.
MARCUS

Got beef with them other niggas?
BAMA

(howling)

Nope—nope—noooooooooll

Bama laughs; Marcus stares at him. They keep working.

MARCUS

Where you from?
BAMA

Down South, how about you?
MARCUS

Queens, New York. Name’s Marcus.
BAMA

I'm Bama.
MARCUS

You from Alabama?

BAMA
North Carolina.

MARCUS
Why they call you Bama, then?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 60.

BAMA
Cause “Lina" sound stupid.

Marcus nods. They continue mopping. Bama twitches.

MARCUS (V.O.)
By total accident my first week
there, I had hooked up with the
craziest nigga in the place.

INT. PRISON — RECREATION ROOM — DAX

,Months later. As a group of other Inmates sit nearby playing
cards, Marcus plays checkers with Bama, who makes a move.

MARCUS (V.O.)
But crazy or not, havin' a friend
made the months pass a lot quicker.

BAMA
Ow—oocoohl King my black assl

As Marcus kings Bama's checker, a GUARD approaches:

GUARD
Philips, you have a visitor.

INT. PRISON — VISITOR’S AREA — DAY

A row of phones separated by Plexiglass. While other Inmates
talk with VISITORS, Marcus enters, spots Cameron. He sits,
picks up the phone, smiles. Cameron does the same.

CAMERON
I brought you a cake with a file in
it, but I got hungry on the way and
ate it.

MARCUS
Thanks for comin' down here man.
I appreciate it.

CAMERON
Of course, are you kidding? So how
you doing?

MARCUS
Hangin’ in there. How about you?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 61.

CAMERON
Good, you know. Graduate next
month, got accepted to St. John's.

MARCUS
Yeah, I got your letter. Law
school now, huh?

CAMERON
I figured with friends like you,
I’ll always have clients.

MARCUS
Not me b, this is the last time for
this shit.

CAMERON

What do you mean?

MARCUS
Mean I ain‘t gettin’ caught again.

Cameron nods. A few beats, then:

CAMERON
So what do you do with yourself all
day?

MARCUS

Work in the mornin’, group therapy,
shit like that.

CAMERON
What about at night?

MARCUS
Nothin', you know. Just chill.

CAMERON
So how about instead of you serving
time, why not let time serve you?
Get your GED. Read. Write.

MARCUS
Fuck I'ma write?

CAMERON
Anything, I don't know. Write
lyrics. Like when we were kids?
{off Marcus' chuckling)
What, you were great.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 7 62.

MARCUS
That was just fuckin‘ around.

CAMERON
You have talent, Marcus.

The guys get quiet. Finally, Marcus changes the subject:

MARCUS
Ever see that girl anymore, the one
in the blue dress? Charlene?

CAMERON
(shakes his head no)
Leilani transferred.

Marcus nods. An awkward moment. They sit in silence.

CAMERON
I didn't come here to break your
balls, okay? I just think you
could do more with your life than
stand on a corner selling drugs.

Marcus looks at him awhile, finally smiles.

MARCUS
You know anybody else talked to me
like that I'd pop ‘em in the teeth.

CAMERON
You don’t want to hit a lawyer,
brother. I'll sue your ass from
now till forever.

INT. PRISON _ MACHINE SHOP — DAY
Marcus works a lathe, other Inmates working nearby.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Though I didn't tell him, Cameron's
visit gave me a lot to think about.
Besides dealing drugs, music was
the one business that could give me
the lifestyle I wanted with none of
the risk. Money. Power. Pussy.

INT. PRISON ~ RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Marcus sits with Bama and some other Inmates watching a
gangsta music video on television.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 63.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I mean watch TV, half these
motherfuckers are paper gangstas,
singin’ about shit they only seen
in movies —— I was livin' it
every day. I decided right there
to formulate a plan.

INT. PRISON - MARCUS'S CELL — NIGHT

Marcus lays on his cot listening to a Discman, rapping to
himself as he writes lyrics in a notebook. Bama sits nearby
cleaning his sneakers. ‘

MARCUS (V.O.)
I'd bust my ass, work on my music
and within five years move me and
my crew into the rap game. For the
meantime, though, the crack game
was still how I planned to eat.

EXT. HIGHWAY * OHIO — DAY

A Greyhound Bus heads down the road, passing a sign that says
“New York". Through a window we see Marcus, still wearing
his Discman, rapping to himself.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Before I knew it, my time was
up and I hit the ground runnin‘.
First thing I did was make a demo
of some shit I wrote inside.

INT. HOME RECORDING STUDIO - DA!

A makeshift recording ”studio”, with blankets for a sound
booth. Marcus raps into a microphone over a simple beat.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Second was scam a meetin‘ with
Darius Clay.

EXT. DC PRODUCTIONS — PARKING LOT — DAY

A small, nondescript building in Queens. As Marcus stands
across the street, Darius Clay pulls up in a Mercedes, parks
it in the lot. As he heads toward the building...

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision ‘ 09/12/04 64.

MARCUS
Mr. Clay, can I talk to you?

DARIUS CLAY
Ain't that what you doin' now?

Darius doesn’t break stride. Marcus walks alongside him.

MARCUS
Yeah, I... I’m a rapper, my name's
Marcus Philips.

DARIUS CLAY
Son, you ain't no rapper, 'cause if
you was a rapper, I woulda heard of
you. What you are is a wanna—be.

MARCUS
(holds up tape}
Whatever, yeah... I got a demo.

DARIUS CLAY
Pop it in the mail with a letter.

MARCUS
But I’m here now. You ain't got
two minutes?

DARIUS CLAY
I ain’t got one.

Darius leaves him standing there, starts into the building.

MARCUS
Would you have left Tupac in a
parkin’ lot with a tape in his
hands?

DARIUS CLAY
(smiles; keeps walking)
You ain’t no Tupac.

MARCUS
How do you know?

Darius stops in his tracks. Turns around. A beat, then:

DARIUS CLAY
Two minutes.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 65.

INT. DC PRODUCTIONS - STUDIO - DAY

Marcus sits at a sound board with Darius Clay and his
producer, TONY CASH. They listen to the demo a while (a very
rough version of "I’m a Rider”) then Darius shuts it off.

DARIUS CLAY
It’s some real tight shit, but it’s
raw, know I‘m sayin'?

TONY CASH
You got natural talent, but what
you need to learn are the rudiments
of song writing.

DARIUS CLAY
And for the record, you ain't no
damn Tupac.

MARCUS
(smiles)
School me then, that‘s why I’m
here.

DARIUS CLAY
Good. Now any song, any melody,
is broken up into bars, right?

And as Marcus listens intently...

MARCUS (V.O.)

That weekend there was a party for
me at the community center. It was
great bein' home. I

INT. COMMUNITY CENTER — CATERING HALL — NIGHT

CLOSE ON —— a banner reading ”Welcome Home Marcus”. PULL
BACK TO REVEAL the entire Crew, along with Topcat, Majestic,
Breeze and several dozen other GUESTS, applauding as Marcus
enters. They converge on him with hugs.

ROMEO

Welcome back, dawg. We missed your
black ass.

As a RAPPER takes the mic and freestyles, Marcus crosses
to the bar with Romeo, who hands him a bottle of Cristal.
Tyrell approaches in a new suit, looking sharper than ever.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 66.

MARCUS
(as they hug)
Look at this nigga, fuckin' Denzel
over here! How you doin’ man?

TYRELL
Gettin‘ my money.

ROMEO
That's some real shit there, wait

TYRELL
New Lexus. Cherry fuckin' red.

MARCUS
Now you biggin' up on me, huh?

TYRELL
I'm in charge, man, In—
(catches himself)
I mean with you away, you know what
I fuckin' mean.

Marcus clocks Tyrell's attitude, but before he can say

anything, Keryl approaches —— about 40 pounds lighter than
last we‘ve seen him.

KERYL
There's my nigga!!
. MARCUS
Oh fuck, they stop feedin' your
ass?!

KERYL
Dick Gregory, fuckin' protein
powder.

TYRELL

Now we can’t call him fat no more.

ROMEO
Now he just a dumb motherfucker.

They all laugh. Across the room, the Rapper finishes up.
The DJ takes the mic...

DJ
Marcus, come on up here.
{off his reluctance)
c‘mon, say a few words!

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 67.

The CROWD cheers. Marcus heads to the DJ, grabs the mic.

MARCUS
Yo, how y'all doin’?
(the Crowd cheers)
First off, I wanna say thanks to
ya‘ll, I fuckin' missed your asses.

TYRELL
Missed you too, dawg.

MARCUS
Well I'm back now and we ain't
goin' no place but up. Where my
niggas at?
(the Crew goes wild)

I said any gangsta niggas in the
house?!

(even wilder)
This is for you.

A beat starts. The CROWD starts bouncing, then Marcus kicks
in with "I'm a Rider". THE CROWD goes wild; Marcus owns the
place. He finishes up to thunderous applause, crosses to.

INT. MEN'S ROOM — NIGHT — CONTINUOUS

Marcus enters, heads to a stall, opens the door...

INT. STALL — CONTINUOUS

...just as Topcat finishes snorting a spoonful of heroin.

MARCUS
Sorry, Ia-

(notices the heroin)
Fuck you doin’?

TOPCAT
Little h, that's all. Want some?

MARCUS
Since when you do that shit?

TOPCAT
Fuckin' wired man, unwindin' a bit.

Topcat steps out of the stall. An awkward moment.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 68.

TOPCAT
You look good, b, come see me.
I'll get you back in business.

Marcus nods; they hug stiffly. Topcat wipes his nose, exits.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Great as it was to be home, what
you gotta remember about bein' away
is this —— much as you think it
won't -— the world outside keeps
turnin' without you.

INT. TOPCAT'S APARTMENT — DAY
Marcus cops a half a kilo from Topcat;

MARCUS (V.O.)
With my cash reserves near empty,
I saw Topcat the next day. I got
some product on consignment and
went right to work.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — NIGHT

A series of CUTS: With Junebug working the street nearby,
Marcus & the Crew sell to various Fiends.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I was fuckin’ possessed, I hardly
even slept. But hard as I worked
at the crack game, I worked twice
as hard at my music.

INT. DC PRODUCTIONS — STUDIO — DAY

As Darius Clay and Tony Cash work the sound board, Marcus
wears headphones, rapping into a microphone over a beat.

MARCUS (V.O.)
My life became a blur of pumpin'
crack, writin’ lyrics and recordin’
demos. Half the time I didn't even
know what fuckin' day it was.

A BLINDING FAST LOOP OF REPETITIVE SHOTS

Marcus hustles on the street; Marcus in his apartment writing
lyrics in a notebook, Marcus recording in the studio.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 69.

MARCUS (V.O.)

In a few months Bama was out and he
joined the crew. Say what you will
bout a country—ass nigga, but these
motherfuckers have a work ethic.

EXT. 14IST STREET — CRACK HOUSE — DAY

As Keryl acts as lookout, Bama sells crack from a small hole
in the door to a line of FIENDS who wait outside.

MARCUS (V.O.)

In addition to runnin' a house he
found, Bama took it on himself to
branch out into insurance scams.

INT. U—HAUL OFFICE « DAY
Bama stands at the counter filling out paperwork.

MARCUS (V.O.)

He’d rent a U—Haul, max it out on
liability insurance, then rent a
limo and pack it with fiends.

EXT. MERRICK BOULEVARD — DAY
A black stretch LIMO rolls down the street.

MARCUS (V.O.)
At the appointed time...

SCREECH...CRASH!£ A 14—foot U-Haul driven by Bama appears
out of nowhere, rearuends the LIMO at a very moderate speed.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Every one of them niggas would have
severe back and neck injuries.

The FIENDS, all dressed in party clothes, stagger from the
limo exaggeratedly holding their back and necks.

MARCUS (V.O.)

We’d give 'em each a grand for
their trouble, send ’em to fugazy
doctors we lined up, then collect
when the insurance money rolled in.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 70.

INT. MOTEL ROOM — DAY

Bama sits on the bed talking on the phone as an ELDERLY LADY,
80s, sits in a chair nearby, purse on her lap.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I finally got called in when Bama
started kidnappin' niggas. I mean
this motherfucker was snatchin'
people we knew!

BAMA
,Yo, Edgar, I got your Grandma, you
wanna see her again lemme hold
twenty thousand.
{hands phone to old lady)
He wanna talk to you.

INT. RESTAURANT — BACK ROOM - DAY

As a BODYGUARD stands nearby, Marcus and Bama sit across a
table from Majestic and Breeze.

MAJESTIC
So what’s this shit, your boy here

MARCUS
It ain't like that, it's——

MAJESTIC
Shit gotta stop, this ain‘t the
wild west, motherfucker.

BAMA

MARCUS

BAMA

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04

Bama gets up, HOWLING as he exits.

On Marcus.

MARCUS
GO.

MAJESTIC
Fuck's wrong with this nigga?

MARCUS
He's a little fucked-up, a—ight?

MAJESTIC
Little fucked—up? Pay attention.
Nigga like that get you killed.

MARCUS
He’s ambitious, that's all, he
likes makin' money.

MAJESTIC
And what about you?

MARCUS
What about me?

MAJESTIC
I hear you over that studio every
day, that tells me you ain't
tendin' to business.

MARCUS
I’m earnin' more than ever.

MAJESTIC
Well see it fuckin' stays that way.
And keep that country—ass nigga on
a leash.

EXT. MEDICAL BUILDING — DAY

Marcus pulls up in a brand new Mercedes, parks.

MARCUS (V.O.)

Later that day I dropped Bama at
the doctor for his own fake claim
from the U—haul shit.

71.

As soon as he's gone:

Bama wears a phony neck—brace; Marcus helps him from the car.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 72.

MARCUS
I'm serious yo, you don't start
chillin‘ you'll be Wearin' one of
them shits for real.

BAMA
I'm the wolfman dawg, fuck you
worried about?

- MARCUS
(play shoves him)
I'm serious, motherfucker.

Bama laughs as they head to the building.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE a WAITING ROOM — DAY

Marcus reads a magazine, Bama next to him twitching. From
behind the desk, the RECEPTIONIST reads the sign—in sheet.

RECEPTIONIST
Elijah Samuels?
(off Bama’s look)
The doctor will see you.

As Bama disappears inside, the Receptionist calls out:

RECEPTIONIST
Charlene, I'm goin' to lunch.

CHARLENE (0.5.)
Bring me back a Diet Coke?

As the Receptionist exits, she is replaced at the desk by
Charlene, the girl we met earlier at Club Starlight. As she
busies herself with paperwork, Marcus smiles and approaches.

MARCUS
Excuse me.

CHARLENE
(not even looking up)
Can I help you?

MARCUS
Yeah, I'm here 'cause of a broken
heart.
(she looks up)
I met this girl at a club a few
years back but she wouldn't give
me her number.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 ‘ 73.

Charlene's jaw drops.

CHARLENE
Oh my God.

MARCUS
How you been?

CHARLENE
Good, good, you know...

MARCUS
Still in college?

CHARLENE
I took some time off, I'm thinking
of going to nursing school.

MARCUS
Well like I said, I got this broken
heart here.

CHARLENE
That sounds a little advanced for
me.

MARCUS

You seem like a smart girl, I bet
you could handle it. Still got a
boyfriend?

7 CHARLENE
Not at the moment.

MARCUS
(touches his heart)

So can I call you, make an
appointment for this thing?

Charlene debates it, then smiles, writes her number down.
CHARLENE
Office hours are Saturday nights
only. And I don't take Medicare.
Bama emerges as Marcus smiles, takes the slip of paper.

MARCUS
I’m feelin' better already.

Marcus exits with Bama. On Charlene.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 74.

INT. MERCEDES — LATER

Parked near a McDonald’s, Marcus and Bama eat, just hanging
out. Across the street, a gleaming black BMW sedan pulls up.

MARCUS
Check this shit.

A LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN in a suit emerges from the Beemer,
heads into the Check Cashing Store with a briefcase.

MARCUS
Colombians. Use that-place to
launder money.

BAMA
Real Tony Montana shit.

As they eat, Marcus looks down the block, spots
JUNEBUG

emerging from a bodega, heading their way. Quietly, Marcus
slips his .9mm from his waistband.

RAMA
‘Sup?

MARCUS
Bitch—ass nigga Junebug.

We play the tension as Junebug passes. Marcus stares at him,
then goes back to eating in silence with Bama. Finally:

EAMA
Till I came here you know I never
really had no friends.

MARCUS
That’s cause you a crazy—ass nigga.

BAMA
I'm serious, yo. Thanks for
stickin' up for my ass.

Marcus nods, says nothing. They continue eating...

MARCUS (V.O.)
When you run a crew, you can rarely
afford to show your men kindness,
not even for a second.

(MORE)

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04

MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
Especially in the crack game, where
a second can mean the difference
between ridin’ in a limo or ridin'
in a hearse.

EXT. CHARLENE‘S APARTMENT BUILDING — NIGHT

A black stretch limo is parked at the curb; its DRIVER stands
waiting. Marcus emerges from the building with Charlene, who
wears a beautiful dress. As the limo pulls off, we see that
it’s being followed by a White Bronco with tinted glass.

INT. WATER'S EDGE RESTAURANT ~ NIGHT

With the Manhattan skyline glistening in the background,

Marcus and Charlene sit at a romantic table for two.
They toast with champagne, then begin eating.

CHARLENE
So let‘s see. Champagne, limo,
fancy restaurant. I guess you
must be an investment banker or
something.

MARCUS
Somethin' like that.

CHARLENE
That why you got your boys over
there watching your back?

At a nearby table, we see Bama sitting with Keryl.

MARCUS
(smiles)
Does it matter?

CHARLENE
Depends how far this goes.
(a few beats; then)
Tell you the truth, I suppose I
already know what you do.

MARCUS
But you went out with me anyway.

CHARLENE
Guess I have a thing for bad boys.
But not too bad.

Marcus smiles.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 76.

CHARLENE
So why would a guy like you be
interested in someone like me?

MARCUS
Someone like you? You’re
beautiful.

CHARLENE
Working girl, straight—laced.

MARCU S
I like someone challenging, I
dunno. Someone I can talk to.

CHARLENE
Challenging, huh?

MARCUS
To a.point.

Charlene smiles. They continue eating.

EXT. EAST RIVER — NIGHT
Marcus and Charlene walk along the water.
CHARLENE

So how'd you get into... investment
banking, is it?

MARCUS
Family business, I had no choice.
CHARLENE
Your daddy was a player?
MARCUS
My moms.
CHARLENE
Your mother?!
MARCUS
Maybe that‘s why I like strong

women .

Charlene smiles. They continue walking. Ten paces behind,
we see Bama and Keryl following.

CHARLENE
They gonna be with us all night?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 77.

MARCUS
(smiles)
Not all night.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT h LIVING ROOM — NIGHT
Marcus and Charlene sit on the couch; soft music; nightcaps.

CHARLENE
So when you said before you had no
choice but to get into the game,
what’d you mean by that?

MARCUS
It's where I’m from, You know. You
play the cards you’re dealt.

CHARLENE
But sometimes you can trade the
ones you were dealt for new ones.

MARCUS
That's what I’m plannin’ on doin'.

CHARLENE
What do you mean?

MARCUS
Music. I been developin‘ my
skills, workin’ with Darius Clay.

CHARLENE
Seriously?

MARCUS
Sent my demo out this week, tryin‘
to get a record deal.

CHARLENE
Really? That‘s great.

MARCUS
(a few beats; then)
So why didn’t you give me your
number that night?

CHARLENE
I told you I had a boyfriend and...

MARCUS
And what?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 78.

CHARLENE
Nothing. It's corny.

MARCUS
Come on, what?

Charlene looks at him.

CHARLENE
”Cause I knew if we were meant to,
one day we'd meet again.

Marcus looks at her, then:

MARCUS
I don't think that's corny at all.

And as they kiss...

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - BEDROOM — NIGHT

The lights are dim. Marcus carries Charlene into the
bedroom, gently places her on the bed. Slowly, they continue
to kiss as they undress each other and begin to make love.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — BEDROOM w LATER

Marcus sleeps alone in his bed. After a few beats, he stirs,
looks at the clock —— 2:18 a.m. He notices a light on in the
living room, gets up to investigate.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Marcus emerges in boxers. On the couch, wearing his shirt is
Charlene, who wears headphones, eyes closed as she listens to
music. Marcus comes up behind her, touches her. She jumps.

CHARLENE
Jesus, you scared mel

MARCUS
(chuckling)
Whatchu doin', where'd you go?

CHARLENE
I wasn't tired, so I came out here.

MARCUS
Whatchu listenin’ to?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 79.

Charlene smiles, holds up a CD —— ”Marcus Philips — Demo".

MARCUS
Nah, gimme that.

CHARLENE
No, I love it, it’s great.

MARCUS
You like it? Really?

CHARLENE

Are you crazy? You’re really
talented, you have a gift.

Just then, the phone RINGS. Marcus checks the number.

MARCUS
I gotta take this.

CHARLENE
Some other girl?

MARCUS

(shoots her a look; then)
Hello?

INT. TOPCAT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Topcat, high off his ass and covered with blood, stands
holding the phone. He slurs as he speaks.

TOPCAT
It’s me, fuck you doin'?

INTERCUT MARCUS AND TOPCAT

MARCUS
I’m chillin’. Wassup?

TOPCAT
I need you over here.

MARCUS
What's wrong, you all right?

TOPCAT
Just fuckin' get here!

Topcat clicks off. Marcus turns to Charlene.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 80.

MARCUS
I gotta take you home.

INT. TOPCAT'S APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — LATER

Still high, Topcat opens the door, lets Marcus in. The place
is a shambles. Marcus notices the blood, spots a hypodermic
needle, spoon and small bag of heroin on the coffee table.

MARCUS
The fuck you doin’ to yourself?!

TOPCAT
(plops on the couch)
I dunno, man. This motherfucker...

MARCUS

What motherfucker, who?
TOPCAT

It shoulda been me, son... it

shoulda been me...

MARCUS
What you mean? Majestic?

TOPCAT
You don't know what the fuck you
talkin' about, boy! Levar...

MARCUS
Levar what?
(puts it together)
So you got passed over, this is how
you deal with the shit? You become
a fuckin' junkie?!

Topcat shakes his head, vaguely nods to the kitchen. Marcus
slowly makes his way inside, where we see SLIM, the hustler
who killed his mother, lying dead on the floor with a kitchen
knife plunged in his chest.

MARCUS
Who the fuck is this?!

TOPCAT
Nigga Slim, kill your mama. Saw
him on the street, he came back
around, I brought him up here.

Marcus lunges, grabs Topcat by the shirt, lifts him up.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 81.

MARCUS
Why didn't you call me?!

TOPCAT
I don't... I... I didn't——

MARCUS
I told you if you ever find this
motherfucker let me know!

TOPCAT
I didn’t have——

MARCUS
(shaking him)
You junkie motherfucker!

TOPCAT
(struggling to fight back)
Don't you talk to me like that,
boy!

MARCUS
I ain't your fuckin' boy!

Marcus shoves him back on the couch hard. Topcat looks up
at him, eyes tearing up. After a few beats...

MARCUS
What? You got somethin’ you wanna
say to me?

TOPCAT .
I loved her too, motherfucker...
I fuckin' loved that girl.

Marcus looks at him, processing. An eternity, then...

MARCUS
C’mon, let's get rid of this shit.

And as he pulls some Hefty bags out of a kitchen drawar...

INT. MARCUS’ APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM * DAWN
Marcus enters, pours himself a drink, then sits on the couch.

MARCUS (V.O.)

We dumped the body in the weeds
near the airport, then I dropped
Topcat back at his crib.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 82.

INT. TOPCAT’S APARTMENT — BATHROOM — DAY

Topcat sits on the toilet, straps up, injects a huge shot of
heroin. After a few seconds, he begins convulsing.

MARCUS (V.O.)
It was the last time I'd ever see
him alive.

Topcat stops moving.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I never did ask him straight up if
he was my father or not, but for
all we’d been through I guess he
may as well have been.

INT. RESTAURANT — DAY

Closed to the general public. As few BODYGUARDS look on,
Marcus enters with Tyrell, joining Junebug and about a dozen
other HUSTLERS at a long table. At the head sits Majestic,
Breeze next to him. Hennessy all around.

MAJESTIC
So I’ll get right to it. I spoke
to the big man, he sends his
condolences. Topcat was a real
nigga.

Majestic raises his glass. They all follow.

MARCUS
Rest in peace.

MAJESTIC
Obviously y'all are here cause some
decisions have been made and this
comes right from Levar himself.

Majestic scans the contenders, all looking on in
anticipation. Finally, he turns to Marcus.

MAJESTIC
You takin’ over for T—Cat, Tyrell
here your number two.

TYRELL

I didn’t know Levar even knew my
name.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 83.

MAJESTIC
Any problems, let's air it out now.

Majestic trades looks with the other Hustlers, settling on
Junebug, who does his best to hide his disdain.

JUNEBUG
Cool with me.

MAJESTIC
It done, then.

TYRELL
(to Marcus)
God bless,-man, you deserve it.

MAJESTIC
Let's make some fuckin' money.

And as they raise their glasses, we hear the POP of a
champagne cork and we're...

I had no idea by night time I’d
wish it never happened.

EXT. BAR — BROOKLYN — NIGHT

With rap music emanating from within, Bama appears, peaks in
the window. A few PATRONS drink at the bar, while at a table
in the back, Junebug and a few other HUSTLERS have drinks.
Suddenly, the door whips open. Bama enters, gun in hand,
kerchief over his face.

BAMA
On the floor motherfuckers!

The Patrons do as they’re told. Junebug studies Bama as he
turns to the Bartender:

BAMA
Empty that fuckin' cash drawer!

As he starts complying, the ladies room door opens. A young
WOMAN exits... instinctively Bama turns and fires...

BLAM!! BLAMI! Total chaos as the Woman goes down, blood
splattering the wall behind her. And as Bama hauls ass...

MAJESTIC (V.O.)
You specifically said you would
curb this motherfucker!

Still wearing the same clothes from the night before,
Marcus sits before Majestic and Breeze.

He shot a nigga's girl!

MARCUS
I didn't know where he was.

MARCUS
Same as always, keep on hustlin'.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 87.

KERYL
Majestic and that other
motherfucker run this game.

MARCUS
They run it, they don’t own it.

BAMA
We can get our product down south.

MARCUS
Meantime, I’m gettin' an advance on
the record deal.

ROMEO
Enough for everybody?

MARCUS
It ain't a lot, but it should
tide us over.

No one says a word. Marcus looks at Tyrell.

MARCUS
You're bein' awful quiet.

TYRELL
It‘s fucked up, man. These niggas
don't play around.

MARCUS

(re: Bama)
Whatchu want me to do, give his ass
up?! If it was EEK of ya‘ll I’da
done the same fuckin‘ thing!

(a few beats; then)
The door’s wide Open. Anybody
wants to go, now’s your chance,
no repercussions.

(off their looks)
We're this fuckin‘ close to gettin'
outta this shit, I’m recordin’ this
album and I’m gonna blow up. We
all will if we just stick together.

The guys exchange looks. A long time, then:

ROMEO
A—ight, I'm in.

KERYL
Too far to back out now. Let’s do
this shit.

Tyrell looks at Bama, shakes his head.
TYRELL
Crazy ass nigga, whatchu go and

And on Marcus' smile...

INT. DC PRODUCTIONS m STUDIO — DAY
Marcus stands in a sound booth singing into a mic.
MARCUS (V.O.)
Over the next few months, I worked
my see off in the studio.
INT. DC PRODUCTIONS a STUDIO
Marcus signs some papers as Darius Clay looks on.
MARCUS (V.O.)
The advance came in, but between
lawyers, managers and Darius Clay,

there wasn‘t much left over.

Darius hands Marcus a check. He looks at it, frowns.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — NIGHT
A cold night. Marcus and the Crew stand around outside.
MARCUS (V.O.)
On the street things weren't much
better. Not only did we have to
watch our backs...

A FORD TAURUS drives by slowly. Marcus and the Crew stick
their hand under their coats. The FORD drives off.

MARCUS (V.O.)

It was also harder than ever to
come by product.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — LIVING ROOM — DAY

Wearing an expectant look, Marcus lets Romeo and Bama inside.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd RsVIsion 09/12/04 39.

RAMA
(takes out a package)
Quarter key, that all he had.

MARCUS {v.o.)
If there's one thing I learned in
life, it's this —— as complicated
as things seem, they could always
get more complicated.

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT — BEDROOM

Marcus sits on the couch writing in his notebook, Working on
his raps. After a beat, Charlene comes out of the bathroom.
She sits next to him, says nothing. After a while:

MARCUS
Why you so quiet, shorty?

Charlene looks at him, holds up a home pregnancy test strip —
its center is bright BLUE. Marcus processes it, then:

MARCUS
How far are you?
CHARLENE
About twelve weeks.
MARCUS
Twelve weeks? What about your
period?
CHARLENE

I was spotting, I'm sorry...
(starts crying)
I didn't plan this.

MARCUS
That‘s not what I’m sayin'.
CHARLENE
What are we gonna do, we have no
money...
MARCUS
My record’s comin’ out, it's gonna
blow up.
CHARLENE

You don't know that, Marcus.

 

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 90.

MARCUS
I thought you believed in me.

CHARLENE
I go. It's just——

Charlene breaks down crying. Marcus holds her.

MARCUS
A—ight, forget that shit for now.
In a perfect world, what would you
do? '

CHARLENE
Marcus, we have nothingl This is
far from a perfect world.

MARCUS
I'll make it one, answer the
question.

CHARLENE

(looks at him; then)
In a perfect world? I'd have your
baby.
MARCUS
Then that's what we’re gonna do.

EXT. CHECK CASHING STORE — JAMAICA AVENUE — NIGHT

Same shot as the opening. The stolen Suburban site near the
Check Cashing Store, Keryl alone in the driver's seat:

INT. CHECK CASHING STORE — NIGHT

As the Koreans count out CASH, the Guard approaches the
peephole, his .45 pistol still in its holster.

GUARD'S POV THROUGH PEEPHOLE
Rodrigo stands outside, holds up a Nathan's bag.

GUARD
(as he unlocks the door)

Fuck you been, I'm starvin' in—-

BAMMMMIII The door kicks in violently...

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 91.

EXT. CHECK CASHING STORE — NIGHT

Keryl sits in the Suburban, looking toward the store.
Suddenly, the gunshots —— the shotgun BLAST followed by
the RAT—TATwTAT—TAT—TAT—TAT of the Uzi.

within seconds, our GUYS come charging out. Romeo sprints
to the Suburban, tosses the duffel bag inside. Marcus
approaches with Bama, Tyrell following.

KERYL
Fuck happened in there?!

MARCUS
Help me get him in!

Romeo and Tyrell help Marcus lift Bama into the back.

EXT. DESERTED STREET — NIGHT

A desolate road near JFK. Tyrell’s Lexus, Marcus' Mercedes
and a Bronco parked nearby. As Keryl screeches up in the
Suburban, the Crew jumps out, adrenaline still pumping.

TYRELL
We fuckin' did itll

Like a well-oiled machine, the guys scatter to their cars
as Romeo empties a gas can over the Suburban's upholstery.
Marcus tossas the duffel in his trunk, starts to get in.

MARCUS
My crib, tomorrow, 11 o’clock.

With that, Romeo tosses a match in the Suburban. It goes up
in flames with a WHOOSH as the Crew take off in their cars.

EXT. MARCUS' APARTMENT BUILDING — (LATER THAT) NIGHT

The street is quiet, deserted. Marcus pulls up in the
Mercedes, finds a spot near the building.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Whoever said money can't buy
happiness shoulda been me on
that ride home.

He gets out, crosses to the trunk, POPS it.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 92.

MARCUS (V.O.)
My music was on track, I was gonna
be a father... For the first time

in a long time it felt like
everything was gonna be okay...

And as he leans in and grabs the duffel, A FIGURE appears
from behind a parked car, raises a gun. Marcus senses
something, bolts with the duffel bag, but...

SLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets tear into his body; he
contorts, keeps running, tries to grab his own gun, but...

BLAME SLAM! BLAM! More shots; he collapses to the street,
drops the bag, blood gushing from his wounds. And as he
loses consciousness, the FIGURE calmly approaches, takes
aims at his prone body... '

SLAM! Another shot rips into Marcus' jaw. And as the
FIGURE grabs the duffel and bolts, Marcus' blood pools on
the street. And as the CAMERA MOVES IN on his eyes...

TOPCAT {v.o.)
(game show host voice)
Hey hey hey! Let’s give a warm
welcome back to Marcus Philips!

INT. GAME SHOW SET — FANTASY SEQUENCE

Over the sounds of wild APPLAUSE, we’re back on the set
of “Let’s Make a Drug Deal". The adult Marcus stands with
Topcat, who's now dressed in a white tuxedo.

TOPCAT
Congratulations, Marcus, you've
made it all the way to our bonus
round!

We HEAR a series of BELLS, WHISTLES, other SOUND EFFECTS.

TOPCAT
And here's how it works. You can
cash out now and chalk yourself up
as another NYPD statistic...

Topcat nods toward his lovely game show assistant —~ it’s
KATRINA, Marcus' mom, glowing all in white, standing beside
her Buick Regal. She holds a gift box, smiles...

KATRINA
I got you the Atari, baby.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 93.

BACK TO TOPCAT

TOPCAT
Or you can risk it all and go back
to a very uncertain future...

Topcat gestures to his other Assistant —— a fat, middle—aged
NURSE who stands beside a wheelchair.

TOPCAT
So what’s it gonna be Marcus, door
number one or door number two?

THE AUDIENCE is again packed with YOUNG BLACK MALES, but
unlike before, they’re all bullet—riddled and bloody ~~
murder victims, including a laughing, bloody Antwan.

AUDIENCE MEMBER #1
Stay here nigga! Who you think you
are?

ANTWAN
Ain’t nothin' back there for you!

BACK TO MARCUS, who stands with Topcat thinking it over.

TOPCAT
What’s it gonna be, Marcus?

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM — DAY

As Charlene, Grandma, Grandpa and Cameron look on, a DOCTOR,
305, hovers over Marcus, who's wrapped like a mummy, jaw
wired, tubes and wires protruding everYWhere.

DOCTOR
(snapping his fingers)
Marcus? Marcus.

Very slowly, Marcus opens his swollen eyes, tries to focus.

DOCTOR
Hey, you're still with us.
(beat; off Marcus' look)
You're in pretty bad shape and I
know you can't talk, but I want you
to try and squeeze my hand, okay?

Marcus looks at him blankly.

CLOSE ON MARCUS’ FINGERS —— They don't move. Charlene cries.
Finally... he squeezes the Doctor's hand.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 94}

GRANDMA CHARLENE
Thank you Jesus. Oh my God.
DOCTOR
Go back to sleep, you're gonna make
it.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM — DAY

A few weeks later. Marcus, thin, Weak, legs in a cast, head
wrapped, jaw wired, sits in a chair looking out the window.

_ MARCUS (V.O.)
In the weeks followin’ the
shooting, I did nothin' but think.
with nine bullet holes in me,
there wasn’t much I could do.
Though my jaw was shattered and I
could barely talk, I was still
amazingly lucky — whoever Majestic
sent to kill me fucked it up pretty
good.

Charlene, now noticeably pregnant, enters with a malted.
She unwraps a straw, holds it to his mouth.

CHARLENE
Here baby, Sip this.

The phone RINGS. Charlene crosses and answers.
CHARLENE
Hello?... Hold on.

(turns to Marcus)
Genesis Records?

Marcus nods, takes the phone.
MARCUS
{through wired jaw)
Lo?

Marcus listens a while, hangs up. Charlene looks at him.

MARCUS
They droppin‘ me.

Charlene crosses, gives him a hug...

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 95.

MARCUS (V.O.)
For months after, I refused to see
any of my crew —— as their leader I
couldn't afford to let them see me
in a compromised position.

EXT. COTTAGE — POCONOS u DAY

Rural; the middle of nowhere. With Marcus in the passenger
seat, Charlene pulls up and parks a beat up Chevy near a
small, run—down cottage.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I sold my car, scraped together
some cash, then moved us up to a
small house in the Poconos.

Marcus gets out of the car on crutches - though his jaw is no
longer wired, he’s extremely thin.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I had lost sixty eight pounds.

Charlene reaches into the back of the car, removes a car seat
with an INFANT strapped in.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Aside from Charlene and our new
baby Michael, I didn't have a
fuckin‘ thing.
INT. COTTAGE — POCONOS — DAY

Dingy; hardly any furniture. Marcus and Charlene sit at the
table eating dinner, the BABY asleep in a crib nearby.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I was in exile.
INT. PHYSICAL THERAPY OFFICE — DAY

As a PHYSICAL THERAPIST guides him, Marcus slowly walks
between two parallel bars.

PHYSICAL THERAPIST
Easy. Use the supports, come on.

Marcus frowns, keeps walking. He's clearly in pain.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd ReviSion 09/12/04 96.

MARCUS
(slurred; stiff jawed)
We been doin' this for weeks.

PHYSICAL THERAPIST
It may take years, Marcus.

INT. COTTAGE — POCONOS — DAY

A dejected Marcus sits watching Jerry Springer. Outside,
Charlene pulls up in the Chevy.

EXT. COTTAGE — POCONOS — CONTINUOUS

Marcus limps outside as Charlene takes the baby out of his
car seat.

MARCUS
Hey.

CHARLENE
Can you take him?

Charlene hands Marcus the baby. He winces from the weight.

MARCUS
Ah. Fuck.

CHARLENE
(grabs the baby)
Give him to me. Go back inside.

MARCUS
Fuckin' shoulder.

INT. COTTAGE - POCONOS — CONTINUOUS

Marcus limps back inside. Charlene follows with the baby and
a bag of groceries. As they put them away in silence, the
phone RINGS. Marcus lets the answering machine pick it up.

TONY CASH
(over anSWSring machine)
Marcus, it's Tony Cash, you there?

CHARLENE
You wanna get that?

Marcus shakes his head no.

Untitled so Cent ProjeCt 2nd Revision 09/12/04 97.

TONY CASH
(over answering machine)
Just so you know I left Darius, I'm
out on my own now. Hit me up,
let's talk.

The machine cuts off. They continue putting away the
groceries in silence. After a while...

CHARLENE
You gonna call him back?

MARCUS
For what?
CHARLENE
I dunno. To talk about recording?
MARCUS
Recordin’?! I can barely fuckin’
talk!
CHARLENE

So that's it then? This is it?

MARCUS
Fuck you talkin' about?

CHARLENE
This! This place, this life! Is
this it for us?

MARCUS
I'm in fuckin‘ pain, Charlene!
CHARLENE .
What about me, you don’t think I'm
in pain?!
MARCUS

I almost fuckin’ died!

CHARLENE
And you’re acting like you did!

Marcus stops in his tracks.

CHARLENE
I know you hurt, Marcus, I can't
imagine how bad, but it can't be
worse than what I feel when I see
you giving up on yourself.

CHARLENE (cont'd)
(several beats; then)
You don't lose a fight by getting
knocked down, baby. You lose by

staying down.

Marcus looks at her. After a long time, he crosses, puts his
arms around her.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Charlene was right. Everything I
ever got was 'cause I busted my ass
to get it.
INT. COTTAGE u POCONOS — BEDROOM ~ DAY

Wearing sweats and a T~shirt, Marcus sits on the edge of the
bed slowing tying his sneakers.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Why should gettin’ better be any
different?

And as some driving music kicks in, we're in a MONTAGE...

INT. GYM — DAY

Marcus enters the gym. Slowly, he lifts weights, just the
bar at first. He grimaces in pain.

INT. COTTAGE - POCONOS — DAY

Marcus lays on the floor, plays with Michael as Charlene
makes dinner.

INT. BATHROOM w DAY

Marcus stands before the mirror slowly working his jaw
muscles, forcing his mouth to form Words through the pain.

INT. GYM — DAY

Marcus walks on a treadmill. Lifts weights again —— this
time there‘s more than just the bar.

EXT. COTTAGE — POCONOS — DAY

Leaves are changing color. Marcus walks in the yard with
Michael, now several months older.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12104 99.

INT. GYM — NIGHT

Shirt off, Marcus does pull ups; he's gaining weight and
muscle. We see him on the treadmill —— running.

INT. COTTAGE — LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Marcus speaks into a mic, recording himself rapping. He
plays it back, seems satisfied with the results.

INT. COTTAGE — POCONOS — KITCHEN — NIGHT

Weeks later. Marcus stands drinking a protein shake.

INT. GYM — DAY

Marcus bench presses real weight; he looks like his old self.

EXT. WOODS — POCONOS — DAY

With snow on the ground, Marcus runs, throwing punches like a
boxer. And as he nears the house, we:

CUT TO:

Tony sits reading the paper. The phone RINGS. He answers.

And on Tony's smile...

INT. RESTAURANT — POCONOS ~ DAY
Marcus sits with Tony eating lunch.

TONY CASH
So what’s the plan, man? whatchu
gonna do with yourself?

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 100.

MARCUS
Haven't really thought about it.

TONY CASH
You like it up here?

MARCUS
Yeah, it's a—ight.
(off Tony’s look)
It fuckin' sucks, okay?

Tony laughs, pushes his plate away.

TONY CASH-
Obviously I didn't drive all the
way up here to talk about real
estate. So you got my message I
left Darius, right?

MARCUS
What happened?

TONY CASH
Good guy, different vision.

Marcus nods. A few beats, then:
TONY CASH

I think you should focus on
recordin' again.

MARCUS

For who? Genesis dropped my ass.
TONY CASH

Fuck Genesis, record for the

street.

(off Marcus‘ look)
Mix tapes, bootlegs, sell ‘em right
there on the sidewalk. You got a
buzz man, people already know who
you are. Fucked as it is, gettin'
_shot got you more press than any
fuckin' record deal.

MARCUS
Some fuckin' publicity stunt.

TONY CASH
I got a studio right in my
basement, we can work in private.
It's quiet, isolated, away from all
the bullshit.

TONY CASH (cont'd)
You do a record, we drop it, do
another, drop that a month later.
You're back from the dead man,
your shit'll be everywhere.
What do you say?

And as Marcus mulls his decision:

MARCUS (V.O.)
Much as you hear the term used,
there's no such thing as a gangsta
rapper. Truth is you can't be
both, at least not effectively.
You’re either a gangsta g; a rapper
and each one requires your full and
total dedication. I decided that
day to put the thug life behind
me —~ I was now a rapper.

Marcus looks Tony in the eye.

MARCUS
When do we fuckin' start?

And as one of Marcus’ songs kick in...

INT. TONY CASH’S HOUSE — STUDIO — DAY

A small in—home studio. As Marcus stands in the sound booth
rapping into a mic, Tony works the sound board.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Within a week, I started workin'
with Tony night and day. We began
with some shit I wrote in the
hoepital.

Over the song Marcus is recording, we see the following:

INT. PHOTO STUDIO — DAY
Marcus poses for a PHOTOGRAPHER, shirt off.

CLICK. The Photographer takes Marcus' picture, which we see
on the cover of a mix tape CD titled ”Bulletproof".

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 102.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Since the crack game was what I
knew best, I decided to use those
same skills in the record business.
I was the supplier...

INT. TONY CASH'S HOUSE - BASEMENT ~ DAY
Bama sits at a table, inserting CDs into jewel cases.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Bama was in charge of packaging...

And Keryl and Romeo handled
distribution...

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Wearing shades, dressed sharp, Tyrell leans against a new Jag
parked on the corner.

Though I hated to see him go,
Tyrell decided he‘d rather take his
chances on the street. Within days
my shit was all over New York...

EXT. STREET CORNER — QUEENS — DAY

Keryl and Romeo pull up in the Bronco, park near a sidewalk
CD stand. And as they unload cases of ”Bulletproof"...

MARCUS (V.O.)
Street corners...
INT. CLUB — NIGHT

The dance floor is packed. Bama and Romeo cross the room,
hand the DJ a CD. The DJ takes it, nods.

now my music floodin’ the city.

INT. TONY CASH’S HOUSE — STUDIO — DAY
Marcus at the mic; Tony at the board. The Crew looks on.

MARCUS (V.O.)

As for me, I kept in the studio,
doin' six more records in seven
months.

EXT. STREET CORNER — DAY

At a different sidewalk CD stand, we PAN across a row of
Marcus Philips bootlegs, all with different covers.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Even still I knew I could do more.

INT. MARCUS’ APARTMENT e LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

With BET on the television, Charlene serves pizza as Marcus,
Keryl, Tony and Romeo sit around bullshitting. Bama sits on
the floor playing with the Michael, now a toddler.

MARCUS
What we need’s a record to grab
people, get they attention.

ROMEO
Dawg, you all they talkin' about
out there.

TONY CASH
Maybe so, but we’re talkin' about
gettin' to the next level.

MARCUS
Create some controversy.

CHARLENE
Thanks, but I think I’ve had more
controversy than I can stand.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 104.

MARCUS
You know what I mean.

As they ad—lib goodnights, Charlene exits to put Michael to
bed. On TV, a lame gangsta video plays. Bama watches it.

BAMA
Check these lameuass niggas.

ROMEO
That ain't gangsta.

RAMA
(to Marcus)
You seen more shit in a afternoon
than these niggas seen in they
whole lives.

The guys watch in silence a while, eat their pizza, then:

That's it.

MARCUS

That’s I'ma sing about, all the
shit happened to me.

TONY CASH
What?

Pumpin’ crack, gettin' shot. I'll

Sure you wanna do that?

MARCUS (V.O.) (cont'd)
In his own crazy way, he had just
given me the idea that would change
our lives. Three days after
finishing that pizza, I laid down
a new track in Tony's basement.

CUT TO:

INT. TONY CASH'S HOUSE « STUDIO — DAY

As Tony works the board, Marcus records a song similar to
“Ghetto Q'uaran” appropriate to the movie in which he names
names and talks about real events in his life. As it plays:

EXT. STREET CORNER — DAY

A SERIES OF SHOTS: At a sidewalk CD stand, Keryl and Romeo
deliver cases of the new bootleg.

MARCUS (V.O.)
What started as an independent
record hit like nothin' I'd ever
done, I mean it spread like a
fuckin‘ gasoline fire.

KIDS in the park hover around a boom box listening in
disbelief to the song; a local RADIO DJ holds up the bootleg,
talks into the mic; a sidewalk CD Hustler hawks the bootleg
on the street.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Suddenly everybody was talkin'
about me, and not just fans either.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Majestic and Breeze sit in the BMW, listening to the CD.
They don't look happy.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Truth is, I didn‘t give a fuck.
INT. COTTAGE — POCONOS — NIGHT

Cameron sits at the kitchen table, in mid—conversation with
Marcus, who's sits across from him going over some papers.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 106.

CAMERON
...so aside from that, it’s a
standard contract. Tony'll make
the rounds, call us from L.A.

Marcus nods. He looks up at Cameron, senses something.

MARCUS
What else on your mind?

CAMERON
I got a call from the District
Attorney's office. They're still
investigating the shooting.

MARCUS
(chuckles)
Why they waste their time? They
know I ain‘t gonna testify against
fuckin' Majestic.

CAMERON
That's the thing though... they
don't think it was him.

MARCU S
Obviously it wasn’t him literally,
it was some nigga work for him.

Cameron says nothing.

MARCUS
What?

CAMERON
Look, this is some really
confidential shit, okay?

MARCUS
Stop talkin' to me like a lawyer,
b. What?

CAMERON

(leaning in)

The Bureau of Prisons has wiretaps
in all maximum security facilities,
it allows them to monitor high—
level prisoners. After you had
your problem, told Majestic to fuck
off? He called Levar Cahill to
get permission to have you killed.

Untitled 50 Cent Project ' 2nd Revision 09/12/04 107.

MARCUS
So there it is.

CAMERON
Levar said n9. He told ‘em to back

off of you and Bama.

MARCUS
What? Why?

CAMERON
I have no idea.

On Marcus.

INT. COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

As Charlene sleeps beside him, Marcus lays awake in bed.
After a few beats, he gets up, checks the baby, then exits.

MARCUS (V.O.)

For days after that conversation, I
tried to make sense of this shit.

By the code of the street, they had

every right to kill me.

Marcus Sits in a booth, telephone on the wall next to him.
After a few beats, LEVAR CAHILL enters the glassed—in
visitor’s area in an orange prison jumpsuit. .He takes a

Listen, I know you can't really
talk... freely, you know, but...
I just wanted to thank you.

Marcus looks away, doesn‘t know how to say it.

MARCUS
I did some shit, maybe made some
bad mistakes...

LEVAR CAHILL
Stepped on the wrong fuckin' toes.

MARCUS
Yeah.

LEVAR CAHILL
Well just so you know, my boys
weren't the niggas bent you up.

You know you may not know it, but
me and your boy Topcat was pretty
tight at one time.

LEVAR CAHILL
Back in the day, came up together
right there in your old hood.

MARCUS
My baby moms.

LEVAR CAHILL
Baby, huh? Got a picture?

Marcus takes out his wallet, holds a PHOTO of Michael against
the glass. Levar smiles.

MARCUS
Name‘s Michael.

LEVAR CAHILL
(smiles)
Got your mama’s eyes.

Marcus smiles, nods... then it hits him.

MARCUS
You knew my moms?

Levar looks at him.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 110.

LEVAR CAHILL
Much, much better than you realize.
(several beats; then)
Take care of yourself.

Levar hangs up. He touches his fingers to his lips, then

to the Plexiglas. He gets up, crosses off into the prison
without looking back. Marcus watches thunderstruck as he

processes what he's just been told.

EXT. NEW YORK STATE THRUWAY ~ DAY
Marcus drives the Chevy, lost in thought...

MARCUS (V.O.)
The whole ride home my mind was
racin', it was like my brain was on
overload. If Levar was my father,
I had to reinterpret everything I
knew about myself —— not to mention
everything that had happened.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Marcus cruises the boulevard, checking out the FIENDS and
HUSTLERS. He stops at a light, looks across the street where
Junebug makes a sale to Kenneth, the high school bully.

MARCUS (V.O.)
I always assumed it was Junebug
bent me up —— God knows the
motherfucker had his reasons.
But just when I made up my
mind for sure... it hit me.

TYRELL

pulls up next to him in a gleaming new Jaguar, a HOTTIE
at his side. Marcus looks at him a beat, then follows
discreetly when the light changes.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING — DAY

Tyrell gets out of the parked Jag, looking like a million
bucks. As he opens the passenger door for his GIRLFRIEND...

MARCUS (0.3.)
Tyrell.

Tyrell turns around, startled. Marcus is behind him.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 111.

TYRELL
Fuck, you fuckin’ scared me, man!

MARCUS
(smiles)
Why'd you be scared of me?

TYRELL
I didn’t expect you, fuck...
How you doin’?!

Tyrell hugs him. Marcus is stiff.

, MARCUS
I’m a—ight.

TYRELL
This is my girl, Lena. Say hi to
Marcus.

LENA
Hello.

Marcus just nods. Turns back to Tyrell.
MARCUS

So how you been, seem like you
doin’ real good.

TYRELL
Yeah, you know...

MARCUS
New car, new crib... Gettin' your
money?

TYRELL

(laughs uncomfortably)
Tryin', you know.

FLASHBACK — A QUICK SERIES OF CUTS

The night of the shooting. Marcus parks his Mercedes,
crosses to the trunk. Grabs the duffel. A FIGURE appears,
raises a gun.

SLAM! BLAMI SLAM! BLAME

Marcus collapses, blood gushing from his wounds. And as he
loses consciousness, WE SEE the figure approach and take aim.

It's Tyrell.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 112.

BACK TO SCENE

TYRELL

So you wanna come in for a drink?
MARCUS

Nah, you go. Maybe another time.
TYRELL

Absolutely, man.
MARCUS

Absolutely.

(nods to Lena)
Nice meetin' you.

‘Marcus stands watching as Tyrell and Lena cross off toward
his building...

EXT. REDNECK BAR e PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Marcus stands with a TRUCKER type, 40s, looking into the
trunk of the guy's car.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Later that night, I scraped
together whatever money I had
left and strapped myself up.

Marcus selects a .45 automatic from an open suitcase, tries
it out, then pays the Trucker in cash.

MARCUS (V.O.)
Levar was right —— it was time
to figure out who the fuck I was.

EXT. COTTAGE — POCONOS — DAY

Marcus loads the last of several suitcases into the trunk of
the Chevy, which is packed with moving boxes also. Charlene
pokes her head out of the cottage's front door.

CHARLENE
Marcus, Tony called again.

MARCUS
Fuck it, don‘t worry about it.

CHARLENE
He left like six messages. He says
it‘s important.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 113.

MARCUS
I’ll call him later.

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE — LIVING ROOM — DAY

Grandma fawns over Charlene and Michael as Marcus, Grandpa
and Uncle Sport carry in boxes.

MARCUS (V.O.)

That day I moved us back to my
Grandma's. And though she made us
a big dinner...

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE « DINING ROOM — NIGHT

Marcus and Charlene sit at the table with Grandma, Grandpa
and Michael. Marcus doesn't touch his food.

MARCUS (V.O.)

...food was the last thing on my
mind.

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE — MARCUS' BEDROOM — NIGHT

As the phone RINGS upstairs, Marcus slips the .45 into his
waistband, then slips on a Kevlar vest. A few beats, then:

CHARLENE (0.3.)
Marcus, it's Tony!

Marcus frowns. A best, then he picks up the extension:

MARCUS
I got it!

Charlene clicks off. Marcus talks into the phone.
MARCUS
Wassup?
INT. KALEIDOSCOPE RECORDS — RECEPTION — LOS ANGELES — DAY

GOLD RECORDS, photos of MUSICIANS line the wall. Tony Cash
sits on a couch talking on his cell phone.

TONY CASH

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 114.

INTERCUT MARCUS AND TONY CASH

MARCUS
I'm busy, I'm sorry.

TONY CASH
Fuck all that, I got good news.
Kaleidoscope heard the mix tapes,
they wanna sign you.

MARCUS
Fuck it, Ifm not interested.
TONY CASH
What?
MARCUS
It’s over man, I'm done with that
shit.
TONY CASH
Fuck you talking about?
MARCUS
You heard me.
TONY CASH
You realize what you're sayin'
here?
MARCUS
I know exactly what I’m sayin’.
TONY CASH
Look, let's talk about--
MARCUS
I gotta go.
TONY CASH

Marcus, just——

Click. Marcus hangs up on him.

INT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE — LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

On the couch Grandpa plays with Michael as Charlene and
Grandma look on. Marcus enters.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 115.

CHARLENE
What‘d Tony want?

MARCUS
Nothin'. Business stuff.

Marcus starts slipping on his jacket, heads to the foyer.

INT. FOYER — CONTINUOUS

CHARLENE
You're going out?

MARCUS
I got some shit I gotta take care
of.

CHARLENE

But we just got here.

MARCUS
I'll be back in a little while.

Charlene approaches, puts her arms around him to kiss him,
then pulls back...

CHARLENE
You're wearing your vest?

MARCUS
It’s nothin'.

CHARLENE
You‘re scaring me.

MARCUS
It's a—ight, relax.

CHARLENE
Marcus, what the hell——

Charlene stops, notices
MICHAEL
standing behind them. She looks at Marcus, then:

CHARLENE
Come say bye to daddy, baby.

Michael waddles over in his pajamas. Marcus picks him up.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 116.

MARCUS
Hey little man, you goin' to bed?
You know tomorrow we goin' to
Playland, go on some of them
rides, would you like that?

Marcus looks at Michael. Suddenly it hits him...
FLASHBACK
Same foyer. 8—year—old Marcus in pj's. Katrina kneels down.

KATRINA
I’ll see you Saturday, okay, baby?

BACK TO PRESENT.
Marcus stands looking at Michael.

CHARLENE
You all right?

MARCUS
Yeah.

He hands Michael to Charlene.

MARCUS
I gotta go.

Michael gives Charlene a quick peck, then exits.

EXT. VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY w NIGHT
Marcus drives the Chevy...

MARCUS (V.O.)
There's an old saying that he who
forgets the past is doomed to
repeat it. But hard as it was to
tear myself away from my son that
night, I had to address this shit
with Tyrell.

And as he pulls off at an exit...

EXT. TYRELL’S APARTMENT BUILDING — NIGHT

Tyrell exits the building, crosses to his Jag parked on the
deserted street. He hits the remote. It BEEPS, then:

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 117.

MARCUS (0.5.)
Don't fuckin' move.

Marcus appears from nowhere, his .45 pressed against Tyrell’s
temple. In a flash, he reaches under Tyrell's jacket,
removes his Glock .9mm, pockets it. Tyrell trembles.

TYRELL
You motherfucker.

MARCUS
On your knees.

Tyrell drops to his knees, shaking.

TYRELL
Why you fuckin' doin‘ this, man?
I thought we were friends.

MARCUS
That’s what I fuckin’ thought.
At least have the balls to admit
what you did.

TYRELL
Fuck you!

MARCUS
Say it! Tell me how you fuckin’
shot me, how you left me for dead,
took that fuckin’ money.

Tyrell trembles. Marcus presses the barrel of the gun into
his forehead. Finally:

TYRELL
You woulda done the same fuckin'
thing, man!
Marcus looks at him, almost smiles.

MARCUS
I coulda done the same thing.

Marcus' finger starts to tighten on the trigger. Tyrell’s
eyes close. Marcus squeezes and...

CLICK.

The .45 is unloaded. Tyrell looks up at him, practically
pissing himself.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 118.

MARCUS
The streets'll take care of you,
motherfucker. I'm done with your
ass.

As Marcus turns and heads back to the Chevy, we stay with
Tyrell, who quietly removes a .380 from an ankle holster.

MARCUS (V.O.)
In many ways, the question of
who we are and what we'll be is
determined at birth.

Tyrell runs up behind him, gun drawn, aiming...

MARCUS (V.O.)
For me, the hood was in my blood...

MARCUS SPINS,
Tyrell‘s loaded Glock in his hand.
BLAME
Marcus nails Tyrell with a shot dead center in the forehead.
MARCUS (V.O.)
But that didn’t mean I had to let

it destroy me.

Tyrell collapses in a heap on the quiet, deserted street.
Marcus looks at him, then gets in the Chevy and pulls away...

EXT. GRANDMA'S HOUSE — DAY

With a duffel slung over his shoulder, Marcus kisses Charlene
and Michael goodbye.

MARCUS
I’ll call you when I get there.

CHARLENE
Be careful, okay?

MARCUS (V.O.)
The next day, I packed up and
headed to Los Angeles.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 119.

EXT. GUY BREWER BOULEVARD — DAY

Marcus sits in the back of a car service sedan, which heads
toward the Van Wyck Expressway.

MARCUS (V.O.)

By some miracle, God really gig
let me walk out of hell. For all
his power, though, it always
occurred to me...

At a stop light, he looks out the window. Junebug stands on
the corner, staring at him. They lock.eyes.

MARCUS (V.O.)
He never did figure out how to get
rid of the devil.

And as the car pulls off, we see Junebug through the back
window, still staring. As Marcus turns and looks, Junebug
”shoots“ him with his index finger and thumb.

INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT — DAY

With the duffel over his shoulder, Marcus talks on his cell
phone as he heads toward the security checkpoint.

MARCUS
(into phone)
Yeah, it's me. I'm on the three
o'clock flight.

INT. HOTEL ROOM — DAY
Tony Cash talks on the phone.
TONY CASH

that's cool, right?
TONY CASH

Yeah, whatever. Just get your ass
out here.

Untitled 50 Cent Project 2nd Revision 09/12/04 120.

Marcus clicks off. We PULL BACK to REVEAL Keryl, Bama and
Romeo up ahead, already past security. Marcus approaches the
security conveyor.

SECURITY GUARD
Bag.

Just like in high school, Marcus places his bag on the
conveyor. we play the tension as it goes through the xwray
machine. Finally, the Guard looks at him:
SECURITY GUARD
(smiles)
Have a pleasant flight.
And as Marcus crosses through security and disappears with
the Crew into the airport, we...

FADE TO BLACK .
