Beowulf & Grendel

Tenth draft — July 12/04

FADE IN:
EXT. OCEAN BEACH / NORTHERN EUROPE [500 A.D.] —— DUSK l

CAMERA swoops along a shimmering black sand beach, mountains
rising in the further distance...

FINDING: in the middle distance: EIGHT WARRIORS galloping on
HORSEBACK, armed with spears, swords, shields, netting,
torches.

DOGS race along at their sides.

At the head of the troop rides a grizzled mid—aged WARRIOR,
grimly determined, his face obscured by his battle mask.

The warriors race on, riding to beat the devil home.
EXT. MEADOW —— DUSK 2

With the sun gone below a ridge of barren hills, the darkness
is quickly retaking the ground, bleeding out from the
crevices of rock, the moss, a stream twisting through the
emerald meadow...

...in the middle distance of which GOATS and SHEEP amble
about.

Beyond them, rocky outcrops give way to a dark and shifting
sea... and the low RUMBLE of surf...

Into the foreground there slowly shifts: a huge, stooped
FIGURE. Erect, he'd be nearly seven feet tall, and is twice
the mass of an average man, covered in hair — much of it
greying. Immense arms lead to massive hands, the tough nails
tools for a brutal existence.

His face — or what can be made of it in the falling light —
has a leatherish quality. It also betrays age, as does a
noticeable limp: this is a gigantic nocturnal primate — a
troll who has seen better days.

He scans the meadow, puzzled. He CLUCKS his tongue a couple
of times... GRUNTS out a name of some sort...

FATHER
Grrruhnellll....

He twists his head to one side, raises his nose and sniffs
the wind... wary for a moment... then the moment passes...

(CONTINUED)

He shuffles forward a few more steps, still searching, worry
now edging in. He CLUCKS his tongue again ——
...and he's slammed from behind by something ——

...or, as it turns out, someone: his small child — GRENDEL —
who promptly tumbles past his father, CACKLING at the prank.

From the distance comes the sound of a DOG BARKING.

The father snatches at Grendel. He misses, tries again, and
it becomes a little chase.

Finally the father scoops up Grendel and berates him in with
several low guttural words — a primitive tongue with echoes
of Old Norse.

Grendel responds by grabbing his father's nose and twisting
it, laughing. The father then laughs too.

But once again the father grows wary. Holding Grendel close,
he sniffs the air. More BARKING DOGS....

...then the far—off SHOUTS of HUMANS.

The father urgently swings Grendel up onto his shoulder, and —
fear overcoming his infirmity — with great strides he crosses
back out of the meadow toward the rock outcrops.

EXT. BEACH —— CONTINUOUS 3

The troop of warriors race along...

...till the lead warrior pulls up, eyeing the rocks to either
side. He sniffs the breeze, considers...

...the others waiting on his judgement...

...then he abruptly jerks his horse toward a break in the
rocks, leading up into a meadow...

...the other warriors following.
EXT. WILDS —— CONTINUOUS 4

Grendel's father is moving as best he can... but one hip is
giving him trouble, and his wind is quickly going on him...

Grendel stares back over his shoulder, his face now betraying
the same fear his father feels.

(CONTINUED)

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 3.
CONTINUED: 4

They scramble over rock, twist along moss paths, then down

into a stream... then up the bank, up past massive
boulders... the sound of the DOGS and HORSES edging ever
closer.

EXT. SHORELINE / CLIFFS —— CONTINUOUS 5

The two trolls emerge into view of the sea. Grendel's father
rushes up to the cliff edge, and verbally/gesturally directs
Grendel to descend.

Grendel starts down a few feet before turning and meeting his
father's fierce gaze. He gestures to Grendel to continue
down. Grendel does, but steals a glance back up to find...

...his father turning to meet their pursuers. Grendel climbs
back up to the cliffs' edge to see...

...the warriors charging in on horseback. Several dismount
and take positions on the periphery.

The lead warrior continues forward. Now we see he's
significantly older than the rest; there are years of these
sort of battles in him. And yet the fire is still in his eye
— even as it meets the troll's.

The other warriors hold back, waiting on their leader's move.

The troll scowls back, a snarl escaping.

The lead warrior, unfazed, even spurred on by the challenge,
charges forward and flings a leather bag at Grendel's father.

The bag — hitting — bursts apart, throwing liquid pitch over
him. As other warriors rush forward with torches...

...Grendel twists back down into the rocks, terrified.

There come the SOUNDS of a vicious FIGHT above.... the ROARS
of his father... the warriors' SHOUTS and the BARKING/WAILING
Of dogs... the NEIGHING, HUFFING and STOMPING Of the
horses...

A dog flies past, over the cliff to the rocks below...

Then a sudden WHOOSH... a terrifying SCREECH...

...and Grendel's father staggers off the cliff, stuck with
spears, wrapped in netting, and engulfed in FLAMES.

(CONTINUED)

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 4.
CONTINUED: 5

His body twists down, and SLAPS onto the rocks below, where
it lies motionless, burning... until the first wave washes
in, extinguishing the flames.

Grendel gasps as...

...TORCHES drop through the air on either side, continuing
down to the rocks below — the warriors seeking confirmation
of the kill.

Their CHEERS of celebration wash down over Grendel, and he
looks up to see...

...the lead warrior peering down into the dark, a spear
raised ready to throw, his figure silhouetted against the
torch—lights.

What Grendel does not see...

...is the warrior nudge up his battle—mask...

REVEALING: the wild battle—eyes of the Danish king — HROTHGAR
[50]. His ferocious gaze softens, turns to puzzlement.
Hrothgar, squinting, makes out...

...the tiny troll figure of Grendel nestled in the rocks.

Hrothgar is clearly torn. He gulps in a breath. His hand
tightens in grip on his spear, his mind racing.

Grendel buries his face in his arms.
Finally, Hrothgar's puzzlement shifts to decision. He wipes
the troll—blood from his eyes. Pity overtakes him. His

spear—arm drops... and he turns away.

Grendel, burrowed into the rocks, steals a glance up to
find...

...the warrior gone from the cliffside, the sounds of the
hunt—party diminishing.

But the sound is replaced by Grendel's own sobs.
EXT. SHORELINE —— DAY 6

Grendel comes warily down the stony beach, gaze sweeping
about in search, hands dragging an old sword.

Finally his gaze falls on what he's been searching for...

(CONTINUED)

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 5.
CONTINUED: 6

...the CORPSE of his father washed up in the rocks. He
fights back sobs, and struggles to dislodge it... but the
corpse is too heavy.

He resolves himself, then raises the sword, and swings it
down repeatedly onto the corpse's neck.

Exhausted and crying, he takes up the severed head — a great
weight for him — and cradles it in his small arms.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GRENDEL'S CAVE [15 YEARS LATER] —— EVENING 7

ON: the desiccated HEAD of Grendel's father, positioned in a
crude alcove—shrine, on either side of which small smudges
burn...

The fires have somewhat preserved the head: the eye sockets

are empty, and the flesh is gone from the face, but the skin
has dried and tightened, the long wild hair remains, matted

over and beyond the great brow, the yellow teeth clenched in
eternal grin/grimace...

Sea—shells, stones, and dried flowers are placed around the
head.

REVEAL: Grendel, now an adult, squatting down near a larger
fire—bed of embers, gaze fixed on his father's head... his
own thoughts clearly melancholic...

A breath rolls through him like a shudder. He rises...
...revealing his stature: he's huge, with powerful limbs, the
scale of his father but with none of the infirmity. He
starts up a rocky path toward the faint light of the cave
entrance...

EXT. GRENDEL'S CAVE / SHORE CLIFFS —— EVENING 8

Grendel emerges out onto the cliff edge, and stares down at
the crashing water on the rocks below...

...menace rising in his glassy—gaze, he squats down...

...snatches up a fist—sized rock and smashes himself once in
the forehead...

Blood streams down from his brow and across his face. He
licks the blood as it reaches his lip. Grunts a bitter
SIGH/LAUGH at his wretched state. Blinks through the blood
at...

(CONTINUED)

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 6.
CONTINUED: 8

...the sun edging down into the sea.

He wipes the blood over his cheeks, chin, brow — a battle—
mask in the making.

EXT. ABOVE THE DANISH VILLAGE / PERIMETER —— EVENING 9
With the light fading from the sky...

...the sounds of a CELEBRATION... LAUGHTER, MUSIC... drift up

from the village... *
A CROWD of VILLAGERS circle about... *
...SNORRI [60s] who lifts a blood—stained pine—branch from *
the opened chest of a slaughtered ram lying on a rock. *

Hrothgar [60s now] goes down on one knee before him. Though
greying, he wears his added years as well as any warrior—king
could.

Snorri touches Hrothgar's forehead with the blood. *

SNORRI *
Hrothgar, much—loved King of the
Danes, under Odin's eye I blood you
lucky on all paths that leave this
hall.
A CHEER from the crowd.
Hrothgar rises, smiling, and turns to his grand hall.

His radiant wife — WEALHTHEOW [40s] — hands him a clay jug.

Hrothgar pulls the cap from it with his teeth and pours wine
out across the steps. As it splashes down...

HROTHGAR
May all those who cross these steps
find a happy heart!
More CHEERS rise up from the villagers...

Hrothgar draws his sword and smashes the jug, sealing the
blessing...

...and as the villagers line up to be — in turn — ”blooded”
by Snorri, Snorri bursting out in resonant SONG... *

REVEAL THE LS POV: as that of Grendel, rising over a rock in
the foreground. His expression is solemn. He sniffs the air
deeply.

A shudder runs through him at the sound of the song... the
rising of a mission in his gaze and in his blood.

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / PERIMETER WALL —— NIGHT 10

With some RAUCOUS drunken ROARS and HOWLS echoing through the
village... and — at some distance — REVELLERS making their
swerving way back to the longhouse...

...a lone torch—lit GUARD moves along a boulder ridge, spear
in hand, grinning at the drunks. But then an ANIMAL HOWL
rises rom the darkness beyond, to which he turns...

GUARD
Come near here, y'shitbrain wolves,
you'll get a mouth of spear.

There's movement in the stones below, just beyond the
boulders, just out of sight. The guard peers over.

Nothing for several beats... but then a strange BREATH—LIKE
sound on the wind...

GRENDEL
Speee—arrrr...

The guard takes the torch from the holder in the stone, holds
it out into the darkness, trying to figure what's below.

Several small stones hit him in the face, and he jerks back
in surprise.

GUARD
(wary mutter)
What the...
The guard throws the torch down into the darkness.

Something large deftly shifts out of sight to one side.

There's a scratching of nail on stone as something climbs up
the boulder.

GUARD
Olaf?! Pal?!

The guard swings his spear toward the sound, but without his
torch he can't see much. Then, again, there's silence.

The guard moves to the edge, his spear high, ready to stab...

... but from the side a large dark LIMB swings out, the hand
slapping the guard in the face. The thin CRACK of bone
snapping.

The guard drops, shudders briefly, then his body goes still.

OMITTED 11

INT. MEAD HALL —— MORNING 12

LIGHT bleeds in with the CREAKY opening of the huge door,
REVEALING:

...the night's carnage: broken benches, the BODIES of several
slain warriors... blood splashed about...

ANGLE BACK ON: Hrothgar standing, stunned, in the doorway,
with UNFERTH [30], a sturdy and well—scarred Danish warrior,
to one side and AESCHERE [late 60s], Hrothgar's peer, to the
other. Hrothgar, with Aeschere at this side, determinedly
edges forward over the slippery wood...

....Unferth — hungover and bloodstained — an awkward step
behind.

HROTHGAR
Where were you when all this ——

UNFERTH
(awkward)
Asleep. I'd... I'd... had some
beers.
AESCHERE

No others saw what happened?

UNFERTH
None who can speak.

HROTHGAR
(through his teeth)
What fucking thing would dare ——

But his words end, and his steps slow.

Hrothgar, stunned, crosses the floor past the dead fire—pits
to a slumped FIGURE on the throne at the far end of the room.

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 9.
CONTINUED: 12

It's the guard from the wall, one hand clutching his spear as
in readiness... his hood hanging over his face.

Hrothgar edges up, takes up a spear and, with its point,
lifts the guard's hood — gasps — and jerks back.

Rolling off the shoulders — where his head should be — is a
bloody head—sized stone. It hits the floor with a great
THUMP, and rolls across it, coming to a stop at Hrothgar's
feet.

ON: Hrothgar's face, his horror giving way to a grim
realization.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN:

EXT. OPEN WATER / ISOLATED BEACH —— DAY 13
CAMERA slowly sweeps over sea—water... coming to rest...

ON: BEOWULF [30]... or at least his head, seeming to eerily
bob on a plank of wood on the surface of the water.

The odd wave splashes over him... his eyes closed, face
betraying no life... then suddenly a long SIGH of exhaustion —

and relief...

His eyes flicker open, he blinks, and slowly edges in toward
land, his neck, shoulders, torso inch—by—inch revealed...

...watched by a lone FISHERMAN on the beach mending his nets.

Beowulf, delirious, pushes aside the wooden plank, limps up
onto the sand, trailing seaweed, his shins and thighs
burdened by lamprey EELS attached to his flesh...

He wears a battle—weathered leather tunic, shredded tweed
pants, a baldric—strap tying his sheathed sword to his
back...

His body, though battered and scarred, is obviously one of
great power. His wobbly—kneed stagger still manages the
grace of the warrior/athlete returning from a struggle which
nearly killed him.

FISHERMAN
G'day.

BEOWULF
G'day. I'd owe much to know my
whereabouts.
FISHERMAN

Fish Beach... but likely I'm the
only one who names it that.

(off Beowulf's look / wry)
Where I get fish.

The fisherman goes to his fire—pit and takes from it a
smoking stick.

BEOWULF
I mean who's your king?

The fisherman looks back across the land, considers it...

FISHERMAN
Well... y'know how these things go.

As he talks, he indicates various directions and movements
with his stick...

FISHERMAN (CONT'D)
Late as a couple years ago I think
it was a Hathobard. Swedes rolled
in, pushed them out... Hathobards
came back, pushed them out — then
they got pushed out by Geats.
Wulfings showed up...

(beat / sighs)

Sig Skullsplitter of the Hathobards
was spilling blood this way last
spring. But then he got sick from
sleeping with the sheep. Swedes
came back...

BEOWULF
(hint of worry)
It's Swedish land then?

FISHERMAN
I wouldn't bet a fish on that.
Hygelac the Geat then lay a beating
on the Swedes...

(beat)

I had a boatload of Wulfings wash
up. But they were just corpses.
Stunk to Valhalla.

FISHERMAN (CONT'D)

Had to let'm dry out a week then I

put the whole little crowd to flame

— not knowin what they died of, eh.

(beat / shrugs)
Yeah, I'll be guessing this is Geat
land for now.

Beowulf's relief is apparent.

FISHERMAN (CONT'D) *
Sleep with that, canya?

BEOWULF
Being a Geat...
(nods)
I'm Beowulf. *
By Beowulf's look, it's clear he expects his name to *
register, but — just as clearly — it doesn't. *
FISHERMAN
Beowulf... what, the Eel Meal?

The fisherman nods to Beowulf's eel—infested shins. Beowulf
looks down, gets dizzy and drops to the sand where he sits.

BEOWULF
You've not had another wash up...?
Like myself... name of Breca?

The fisherman shakes his head. As Beowulf talks, the
fisherman methodically starts poking and singeing the eels
with the stick: they unclasp from Beowulf's bloodied flesh
and drop to the sand, where they squirm till the fisherman
whacks them dead.

BEOWULF (CONT'D) *
We were out hunting whale the other
day. Storm came up and ate our
boat. Breca bet he could beat me
to shore. I lost sight of him in
the swells.

The fisherman tries to fathom this.

FISHERMAN
So this is just you coming in now?

Beowulf nods. The fisherman gives a dubious look.

BEOWULF
Y'ever swum in the open sea?

FISHERMAN
Leave that to my boat.

Beowulf stares a beat at the fisherman.

BEOWULF
Am I right to think you mock me?

The fisherman considers Beowulf's grim manner, and his sword.
He starts to gather the eels and throw them in a pot.

FISHERMAN
Can't see much life in that.
(beat)
You do this a lot?

BEOWULF
I take what comes.

FISHERMAN
Good. Then you'll have no qualms
if supper tastes like you.
Beowulf stares. The fisherman gives a battered—tooth grin.

EXT. FISHERMAN'S HUT —— NIGHT 14

The fisherman pokes at his fire while Beowulf nibbles at a
plate of the cooked eels.

FISHERMAN
So... what's it like being a hero?
Quelling things with axes and that
sword of yours... in — what — a

kinda bloody madness?
Beowulf chafes slightly.

BEOWULF
In truth I don't get all that mad.

FISHERMAN
That's all I've heard of your sort.

BEOWULF
You should hear what they say about
fishermen.

They trade a wry grin. The fisherman stirs the fire..

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 13.

FISHERMAN
So... a hero, eh? A hero for
supper. Don't my shit shine!

The fisherman notices Beowulf's squeamishness with the eels.

FISHERMAN
(eyeing Beowulf's plate)
Eat up. Be yourself!

And the fisherman cackles at his joke.
EXT. FISHERMAN'S HUT —— DAY 15

Beowulf and the fisherman stand before a rack of dried fish.
The fisherman is packing some in a small pouch, which he then
hands to Beowulf. Beowulf claps him on the shoulder.

BEOWULF
I'm in your debt.

FISHERMAN
(shrugs)
I'm in the fishes'.
(grim / to the water)
One 0' these days they'll come for

theirs.

BEOWULF
Good luck. May Aegir keep you from
hunger.

FISHERMAN

Good luck with your killing things.
I guess you thank — who — Thor?

BEOWULF
That's uh... not all I do ——

FISHERMAN
No, I'm sure y'piss and shit just
like the rest of us. Gotta say
there's not much use for that here.
(off his look)
Hitting things with axes. Y'oughta
try Daneland.

BEOWULF

FISHERMAN
Oh yeah, word from the whale—road

loose there.

BEOWULF
(dismissive)
I'd think the Danes could handle a
troll.

FISHERMAN
Guess the first eighty thought so
too.

BEOWULF
(jolted)
Eighty?!

FISHERMAN
Well... y'know how these things go.

Some say twenty, some say two
hundred.

BEOWULF
Two hundred?!

FISHERMAN

Yeah it bent my brain too...

thinking that many Danes could even

hold a sword.
BEOWULF

(sharp)
I know the Danes. They've bloodied
seas.
The fisherman reads the ferocity of Beowulf's emotion.

FISHERMAN
Eh, I'm just a fisherman.

Beowulf looks out over the water, torn.
EXT. PATH / RUINED HUT —— DAY 16

Beowulf strides along a sheep trail, crosses over a ridge to
find...

...a smoldering ruin of a HUT, a few SHEEP about. FIVE rough—
looking MEN are eating at a fire—pit.

He edges forward, eyeing the smoke. They eye him warily.

FIRST MAN
Dragon came in the night.

BEOWULF
(playing surprise)
Dragon.
FIRST MAN

Never heard of dragons?

BEOWULF
Oh, I've heard. Just always
thought they were tales.
(glancing around)
And it left without the sheep.
(off their looks)

Just seems odd... from what I've
heard of dragons... to leave a
sheep.

They offer shrugs.

BEOWULF (CONT'D)
So who are your people?
(off their looks)
I know most Geats. And this being
Geat land ——

FIRST MAN
What's it to you?

Beowulf then spots some movement further back behind a
woodpile.

His hand slides to the hilt of his sword.

The first man fixes on the magnificent hilt — a sword of some
renown. He eyes Beowulf with more concern.

FIRST MAN (CONT'D)
That's some sword. You have a
name?

BEOWULF

I don't know yours, you likely
won't know mine. Beowulf.

The others react — looks shooting amongst them — a name they
know and fear.

Furtively they reach for their own weapons.

BEOWULF (CONT'D)
Maybe your dragon came back.

And Beowulf edges up the slope toward the shed...
...till he spots a MAN on the ground humping something.
As Beowulf nears, he makes out...

...the limp arm of a woman, extended over the rock and only
jerking with the thrust of the man.

The scenario becomes immediately clear to him: the burned
hut, the dead woman.

He draws his sword, and directly advances on the bandit
group...

...all of whom now brandish weapons — though defensively.
The first man stumbles back, his movement putting the lie to
his words.

FIRST MAN
Go now, you can go with your life.

BEOWULF
This is my life.
(ironic mutter)
A bloody madness.

And he charges forward, swinging his blade... immediately
slashing the first man to the ground.

A second man comes and, after a couple of traded sword—
strokes, Beowulf grabs the other's sword—arm, and then cuts
him down too.

A third man comes at Beowulf, who blocks his sword—swing,
grabs the wretch by the throat, and crushes it in his hand.

The last two from the fire—pit group now have clearly
panicked expressions. Nonetheless, they come at him with
their swords.

Beowulf routinely meets their strokes, then snatches hold of
one, throws him into the other, then decapitates both in a
stroke.

The headless clutching corpses then shudder to the ground.

Beowulf turns and marches up the slope.

The necrophile, having just secured his pants, starts
scrambling up the slope, WHINING fear.

Beowulf follows for a few beats — and gaining ground — then
heaves his sword into the air.

It sails some distance before descending and catching the
necrophile in his leg. He tumbles to the ground, SCREAMING.

Beowulf strides up to him, pulls his sword from the leg...
NECROPHILE
(a plea)

She was dead!

BEOWULF
Yeah. She was.

And Beowulf swings his blade down upon the wretch.
EXT. HUT —— LATER l7

Beowulf places the dead woman — wrapped, with care, in a wool
blanket — into a shallow grave.

Blood is splattered over his face and clothes, but the
wildness has left his eyes: now he looks only weary.

The CRACK of a branch behind him, and Beowulf twists about,
ready to fight...

...but finds a CHILD [6—7], face tear—streaked, fear in his
eyes.

CHILD
Are you a dragon queller?

Beowulf considers, shrugs...

CHILD (CONT'D)
You quell children?

Beowulf shakes his head. The child eyes his mother.

CHILD (CONT'D)
She might be scared here with these

men.

Don't worry. Crows'll come for
them.

EXT. HEIGHT OF LAND —— DAY 18

Beowulf comes up over a ridge on foot, leading a HORSE, on
which the child sleeps. Beowulf smiles, his gaze finding...

EXT. GEAT MEADOW / SHORELINE —— DAY 19
...a group of tents and SEVERAL DOZEN GEATS, cooking fires
sending smoke to the skies, MUSIC and LAUGHTER drifting up to
the hills.

It's an annual gathering place — large standing stones set in
a great circle, and...

...across a black beach to the water, A COUPLE of LONGSHIPS
lie at anchor.

EXT. GEAT MEADOW / FIREPIT —— DUSK 2O *
With a LONGSHIP silhouetted in the background...

...Beowulf sits almost central at a firepit — opposite his

king — HYGELAC [50s] — surrounded by a cluster of Geat

warriors...

...the great standing stones looming over them like
guardians, the firelight already throwing wild shadows...

Among the Geat warriors is BRECA [30], almost as sturdy as
Beowulf...and, beside him, HONDSCIOH [late 20s], Beowulf's
best friend, and sitting to Beowulf's right.

In Beowulf's lap, the exhausted child is curled asleep in
spite — or because — of the raucous warrior band.

All of them have been — and are still — drinking, and eating.

A short distance away, a group of Geat WOMEN are LAUGHING
and TALKING among themselves.

THORKEL [30], the Geat poet, stands before the men with his
harp, playing a powerful melody. His manner is serious, self—
absorbed, ignoring the questionable attention of some of the
others. His voice rises, resonant, hypnotic...

THORKEL
In a game to gut boredom Great
Beowulf and Breca...

Hondscioh rolls his eyes, snorts derision. Beowulf smiles at
him.

THORKEL (CONT'D)
...hoisted their hopes on the
seething sea...

HONDSCIOH
Only cause they lost their sail.

Breca casually smacks Hondscioh hard in the arm. Hondscioh
mockingly plays great pain. Grins from some, but Thorkel is
undeterred.

THORKEL
The whale—road white as the tongues
of trolls...
BRECA
(at Hondscioh /
appreciative)

Hear that? The tongues of trolls!

HONDSCIOH
Arses, more like.

This time both Beowulf and Breca raise their hands to strike
Hondscioh, who winces, duly preparing for the hits which —

THORKEL

Beowulf shrugs, eyes Breca. Hondscioh follows his look.

HONDSCIOH (CONT'D)
Breca? You tell Thorkel that?

BRECA
Hondscioh, next time you're alone
on open water, just remember not to
drink it ——

BEOWULF
...again.

The roars of LAUGHTER stir the child. Beowulf rises and
carries the child to a bed of furs nearby.

LAUGHTER.

HONDSCIOH
Any fish with any smell would sniff
you two and heave.

HONDSCIOH (CONT'D)
Next time you tell a tale, Thorkel,
try to sift the sheepshit out.

THORKEL
I sing what I'm told!

HYGELAC
The song might well be stronger
than the bones it's built upon.

Nods from the cluster. Thorkel is clearly miffed.

THORKEL
They bring me giants, I'll sing of
giants. I can only work with the
bones I'm given!

Breca fires a look at Beowulf — who furtively indicates — no,
nothing more happened, no thugs were killed.

HONDSCIOH
You want bones, we'll bring you
bones. Troll—bones!

A hint of seriousness slips over the group. Hygelac eyes

Beowulf.

BEOWULF
Hrothgar would cross the water for
us.

Looks shift about, drifting generally back to Hygelac who
broods.

HYGELAC
I know he would. I've had no
better neighbour—king. It's just
that... by the sounds of this thing

BEOWULF
...it's never met a Geat.

There is fierce pride in Beowulf's gaze, and proud nods from
the others. Hygelac looks at Beowulf, torn.

HYGELAC
I won't keep you home to frighten
fish. And, if you can...
(indicates Hondscioh)
...find Hondscioh a wife. Our
sheep can't take much more.

LAUGHS all round — mostly from Breca. Hondscioh gamely
shrugs.

EXT. GEAT HARBOUR —— DAY 21

A LONGSHIP is being loaded, Beowulf watching over the
process. He glances across the dock and sees...

...a row of human HEADS, appearing to be sitting on a
board... amongst them Hondscioh, Breca and Thorkel. One of
the heads moves, starts speaking.

Beowulf recoils a step, then relaxes, seeing the illusion...

...the cluster of MEN standing by the boat, their bodies
blocked by the dock.

Beowulf strolls over to the group. Hondscioh is holding a
harp in one hand, holding off a reaching Thorkel with the
other.

THORKEL
Give it.

Breca snatches the harp from Hondscioh, hands it to Thorkel.
Hondscioh fires a dirty look at Breca, who smirks.

THORKEL
(to Beowulf re Hondscioh /
warning)
He puts one hand on my harp...

HONDSCIOH
Beowulf, we're gonna need some
extra shields.
(off Beowulf's look / re
Thorkel)
For our ears.

THORKEL
(to Hondscioh)
...I warn you — you're a dead man.

Hondscioh gives a mock—shudder. Breca and Beowulf trade a
grin. Thorkel does not, placing his precious harp in a
rabbit—skin bag.

And the loading continues.
EXT. OPEN WATER / BEOWULF'S LONGSHIP MOVING —— DUSK 22

Beowulf is slumped at the side of his LONGSHIP as it cuts
through the water. TWELVE GEATS are with him [including
Breca, Hondscioh and Thorkel], the sail doing all the work.

One man is feeding the hearth fire on which meat is cooking.

THORKEL
Say this thing makes meat of any
man it finds.

BRECA
Danes say. Danes who ran. I've
also known Danes who'll say they
fought off Attila when he wandered
North.

HONDSCIOH

Laughter from the group.
And they sail on.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ICEBERG PASSAGE —— DUSK 23

A glass—still channel of water, in which dozens of ICEBERGS
stand... seeming to exude a blue—white light.

PUSH IN / FIND: a small boat — an Irish CORACLE — drifting...

...in the aft of which a man in ragged monk's cloak — BRENDAN
[40s] — is sprawled, his ratty sail catching the bit of
breeze, his hand draped over the rudder. He appears weak and
sick, his eyes those of a madman, fixed with suspicion on the
looming ice figures...

BRENDAN
(slurred Irish mutter)
...woe betide you beasts of ice...
ogre, troll — I don't wary much...

He raises one skinny arm like a weapon.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)
For I bring the burning sword of
Christ! To cleave you thus... and
thus... and thus!

And he strikes out his arm in the symbol of the cross...
before his energy leaves him and his arm drops.

BRENDAN
Fine then. Hold your tongues...
but dunna think I dunna know your
methods and your manner! They say
you lie more below than above and
on a whim will swing your ice—blue
asses up at God. Yesssss, well, do
as you must...

He rises, clutching the mast, pointing accusingly at the
icebergs.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)
...but hear this vow: I will melt
you and drink you down and piss you
out upon these shores... and —yes —
you may freeze up and walk again...
but only as a Christian thing!

And he LAUGHS like a maniac, then loses his balance, falls,
hits his head on the edge of the coracle — in the process

knocking himself out. And the coracle drifts, as before, but
now in quiet peace.

EXT. DANISH SHORELINE / BLACK BEACH —— DAY 24

CLOSE ON: Brendan's weather—beaten — and unconscious — face,
complete with a scabbed—over gouge in his forehead.

A stone hits his cheek, he winces, his eyes fluttering but
staying closed.

Brendan mutters incomprehensibly, twists sideways, resuming
a fitful sleep.

REVEAL: SELMA [30] standing on a pebble beach several feet
from the run—aground coracle. Though her battered and simple
clothes suggest poverty, there's strength and intelligence
apparent in her. Also wildness and a fierce beauty.

She looks over Brendan... and his simple possessions.

She sees a small sack, opens it, and brings out a handful of
silver crosses on chains. She considers them a moment, is
putting them back, when...

UNFERTH
Selma!

Selma turns to see...
...Unferth — on the shoreline ridge, on HORSEBACK.

UNFERTH (CONT'D)
Y'leave him as he lies!

As Selma steps back from the coracle...

...Unferth gallops down beside them.

Selma studies Unferth a beat with vague contempt.

SELMA
By sickness, eh? Wouldn't that be
welcome?
(off his look)
Already looking out for our people.
You're not king yet, much as you
dream it.

Unferth lets it go. Looks over Brendan's garments.

UNFERTH
What sort of man...

SELMA
Celt. A priest.

UNFERTH
How can you tell?

SELMA
(sardonic)
By knowing. Y'ever leave this
land, you might know things too.
(looks over Brendan)
Needs mostly water... maybe fruit.

UNFERTH
Fruit?

Selma considers the water, and her eyes faintly glaze.
SELMA
But there's others coming... a
boatload of spears.
Unferth glances up and down the shore with evident concern.
UNFERTH
Slavs? No. We killed those
yesterday.

Selma shakes her head.

EXT. ICEBERG PASSAGE —— DAY 25

WIDE ON: the iceberg passage through which the longship
glides.

There is no conversation now, all the warriors moved instead
by the eerieness of the light...

...some trying to draw warmth from the hearth fire.

C/S: of Beowulf's hand dangling over the edge of the boat.
ON: his face as he closes his eyes.

A small wave washes up across his arm...

...and from the water a creature—like HAND reaches up, and
fiercely snatches hold of his wrist.

Beowulf twists around, rips his hand free...
...only to find it's been tangled in a rope from the ship...

...but, in the inky water below, a play of light... something
seeming to descend back down to the dark depths.

Beowulf repositions his hand on the hilt of his sword.
OMITTED 26
INT. HROTHGAR'S CHAMBERS —— NIGHT 27

Hrothgar is creakily putting on his mailshirt. Though only
months have passed since the troll's first attack, these
months weigh on Hrothgar like many years. Too much grief—
driven drink, too many sleepless nights, have brought him the
dull and watery gaze of a lost man.

Wealhtheow, his wife, enters and looks troubled by Hrothgar's
action.

HROTHGAR
Who ever heard of a kingdom laid to
waste by a stinking troll!
(off her look)
I can't game more men against this
thing.

You called it ”he.”

WEALHTHEOW
Women seek a death for a loss.
They get their blood—worth and

Wealhtheow gently strokes his cheek. Her eyes glaze with
tears, but her hands move down and help tie the straps of his
battle—gear.

Hrothgar, meanwhile, takes up his battle—mask helmet — and
stares into the hollow eye—sockets as if at a ghost.

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / PERIMETER—— NIGHT 28

Hrothgar moves out from the torch—lit rock perimeter... a
massive two—handed sword turning in his adrenalined grip.
His eyes fight the darkness, and his fear.

HROTHGAR
(shouts)
Troll! I call you out!

Nothing. Hrothgar takes several steps further.

HROTHGAR (CONT'D)

Troll!
A sudden rise of WIND, and Hrothgar twists about — as though
Grendel had taken wind—form, but the gust passes... silence
resuming.

WITH: A GUARD on the boulders watching Hrothgar in the middle
distance facing out into the darkness.

WITH: Hrothgar staring out, catching Grendel's scent on the
air. Hrothgar's intensity returns, eyes scanning the
periphery.

HROTHGAR (CONT'D)
(shouting)
Meet me in the light if you have
the guts. Or fight me now! You
hairy creep!

The guard shakes his head at Hrothgar's pathetic state

GRENDEL
(throaty mutter / Troll
accent)
Creep creep...

The guard swings about, spear in hand, his gaze rising up and
fixing in terror...

...on Grendel, several yards along the boulder from him, also

watching Hrothgar's performance. Grendel grins, shakes his
head...

The guard's mouth drops open, but his voice utterly fails
him.

Grendel's grin shifts to grimace... as an arm swings up.
WITH: Hrothgar as he takes one or two more hesitant strides
out into the darkness, sniffing the air, sensing something,

his intensity returning.

PEBBLES skid to one side of him. Hrothgar wheels, ready to
strike... but another silence follows.

A shadow crosses Hrothgar. He wheels...

...to meet a large shape descending through the air, which
tumbles in a limp heap, ending at Hrothgar's feet: the CORPSE
of the dead guard, his neck neatly snapped.

WITH: Grendel, watching with grim amusement, from twenty feet
away, one with the boulder he stands beside, as...

...Hrothgar charges forward into the darkness, SCREAMING,
swinging wildly and blindly with his sword...

After several seconds of striking nothing, he stops — catches

his breath — scanning around... but nothing suggests any
shape.

Finally there comes a CLICKING NOISE... and then — almost a
LAUGH.

WITH: Hrothgar wheeling on the sound, making out the massive
shape, which he charges toward... only to find, on arrival,
that the shape is the boulder...

...and Grendel is nowhere to be seen.

CLOSE ON: Hrothgar staring helplessly out and then up to the
brilliant stars. A sad smile comes and tears fill his eyes.

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / PERIMETER —— DAY 29

Wealhtheow urgently comes along the path... passing VILLAGERS
who are subdued, all looking toward...

...Hrothgar who sits, hunched over, on a small rise, facing
the wilds, the dead guard lying beside him.

Wealhtheow hurries up to Hrothgar, looks him over with
concern.

WEALHTHEOW
Are you wounded?
HROTHGAR
The thing wouldn't fight. It
spared me... to witness this.

A shudder rolls through him and he lets out a gasp, eyeing
the corpse. Another jerking shudder...

Wealhtheow glances back, sees the villagers watching, and
whispering.

WEALHTHEOW
(under her breath)
Then get up off your arse... with
your thanes in sight. This is no
ground for a king.

HROTHGAR
(caustic / dazed)

Oh... you're wrong. For a king
who's had his balls hauled up his
guts... it's the ground. For all
the broken—bone wretches I've flung
to death ——

WEALHTHEOW

And Valhalla.
Hrothgar considers the terror in the face of the dead guard.
HROTHGAR

I don't know. Is that the look of
a man going happily up to the

feast... or down to the worms?
WEALHTHEOW
You talk like a madman.
HROTHGAR
No — just the Danish king of
daylight!
WEALHTHEOW
Get up now... or do we bury you
here?
HROTHGAR

Is that your wish?

WEALHTHEOW

Wealhtheow stares evenly at him. He sighs, shrugs.
Wealhtheow turns and strides back up into the enclosure.

EXT. FIELD BEYOND THE DANISH VILLAGE —— DAY 30

Selma is picking berries. The sound of a HORSE approaching.
She turns to find...

...Wealhtheow there. Wealhtheow dismounts, approaches.
SELMA

(nodding to a spot)
Watch yourself.

WEALHTHEOW
You think I've lost feel for the
ground.

SELMA
There's brambles there... bog

there. Last thing I need's a dead
queen on my hands.

WEALHTHEOW
You've had worse and I've been far
far less — dead or otherwise.

Wealhtheow sits down on a rock, while Selma keeps picking. A
long silence.

WEALHTHEOW (CONT'D)
Selma, should I fear for my
husband?

SELMA
If you've got nothing better to do.

I could find a place for you
inside.

SELMA

We chose our beds a long time back.

The women share a look. Wealhtheow nods. Selma continues
with her berries.

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE —— DAY 31
A funeral pyre burns with the corpse of the guard.

ON: Hrothgar sitting on a rock a short distance off,
polishing his sword with a cloth...

BRENDAN
That's one shiny sword.

Hrothgar turns to find...

...Brendan shuffling toward him. He's a bit of a sight: in
his dark and ratty monk's wool cassock, hollowed eye sockets
and fierce — almost unblinking — gaze, plus a wonky and
unpredictable gait.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)
I'm told you're the Danes' king.

Northumbria wishes you well.

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 33.

HROTHGAR
Celt. You're a ways away.
BRENDAN
I am... but safe with the sword of

Christ. Father Brendan.
Brendan bows slightly, his large crucifix swinging forward.

HROTHGAR
I see a man, I see a staff...
(re the crucifix)
I see a weapon for killing toads.
(off Brendan's shrug)
Christ, eh? I've heard of him. He
ever have much luck with trolls?

BRENDAN

I'm under the thought they never
crossed paths.

(off Hrothgar's dismissive

look)
But if you're willing to bow before
Christ, you shall feel the blessing
of his great strength.

HROTHGAR
My gods don't ask me to bow.

BRENDAN
Nor should they dare... if they
won't protect you.

This stings Hrothgar. His hand squeezes the hilt of his
sword, but he resists striking Brendan. Brendan remains

unperturbed.

He eyes the pyre... as the guard is lifted upon it. A guard
begins to blow on a horn — calling the villagers to the
burning.

BRENDAN (CONT'D)
To face God's foes is an honour.
I've come to drive this evil out.

HROTHGAR
With your stick?

BRENDAN
With the fire of Heaven!

HROTHGAR
If your heaven's on fire, y'better

Brendan gets a furious look, and starts to pace before
Hrothgar. Hrothgar, in spite of himself, is a bit impressed
by Brendan's intensity.

BRENDAN
Leave me on a dish for the troll,
then! Leave me and, if I don't see
man's dawn, I shall see God's! I
shall see God's!

Brendan gazes fiercely at Hrothgar a moment, his eyes blink
repeatedly, then he collapses on the ground.

Unferth strides up, checks Brendan, his breathing, his eyes.

UNFERTH
He's asleep.

All Hrothgar can manage is a sigh, a shake of the head at the
grim farce his life has become.

EXT. DANISH SHORELINE / BLACK BEACH —— DAY 32

Beowulf's longship edges into the shallows of a black
beach... stone promontories rising high on either side.

He and half his men jump down into the water, and — guide—
ropes in hand — haul the boat up upon the stones.

As the men in the boat begin passing over their battle—gear
to those in the water...

...they turn to the sound of a NEIGHING HORSE...

...and see ERIK [a coast—guard] come galloping down through a
break in the rock, and pull up in the stones... just out of
spear distance.

ERIK
Hold there!

BEOWULF
As you wish. Is this land Dane?

ERIK
It is... and you're not. So
unless, you're ripe for a shower of
arrows, you'll tell who you are.

ERIK (CONT'D)
Two blows of this and fifty men

you've strapped your ring—shirts.

HONDSCIOH
Fifty birds maybe.

ERIK
(a threat)
Is that then your word?

BEOWULF
I'm Beowulf ——

The name registers sharply with Erik.

ERIK
Beowulf the Geat.

BEOWULF
(nods)
We come as friends to Hrothgar.

Erik looks over their equipment, and over Beowulf — trying to
mask his awe.

ERIK
We welcome friends. Bring what you
need. I'll have men look to your
ship.

Erik blows ONCE on his HORN... the powerful and eerie sound
echoing off the cliffs.

HONDSCIOH
One blow is good news?

ERIK
One blow is good.

Hondscioh winks good—naturedly. Erik glances at Beowulf who
shrugs.

As Erik and the Geats come up over a rise, and into sight
of...

...the Danish village. Erik rides up ahead to...

...a GUARD at the break in the rocks who, after a moment with
Erik, waves them in.

The Geats continue forward, scanning...

...VILLAGERS clustered around a couple funeral pyres. The
villagers stare back — listless, forlorn, dead—eyed — at the
Geats.

HONDSCIOH
(low to the other Geats)
By Thor... they've got the spark of
cows.

BRECA
How bout that one.

Beowulf and Hondscioh follow Breca's gaze...

...to Selma, coming from the opposite direction, carrying her
baskets. She's a jolt of vigor and beauty, especially set
against the dregs through which she moves.

Beowulf finds her studying him with interest; he edges up to
Erik.

BEOWULF
Who's the one with the baskets?

ERIK
Selma. A witch. The happy would
keep a boat—length from her.

Happiness isn't everything.

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / MEAD HALL —— MOMENTS LATER 35

The Geats come up to the great hall — a magnificent wood and
stone structure, three stories high. Below the eaves is hung
the great pair of buck's antlers, and around these are ornate
wood carvings.

The Geats are obviously impressed.

BRECA
That's one beer—hall, eh Hondscioh?

Before Hondscioh can respond...

ERIK
If you like to drink with ghosts.

As the Geats consider this, a commotion rises behind them.
They turn to see...

...a cluster of men striding toward them, the commotion
coming from the older man at the center who is GROWLING
impatience, Unferth at his side, muttering explanations.

As they near, Beowulf recognizes the old man as...

...Hrothgar, who is half—drunk and just roused from sleep.
Hrothgar, seeing Beowulf, strides clear of his own retinue.

Beowulf struggles to mask his surprise at the king's wretched
appearance.

HROTHGAR
By the gods! My little Beowulf!
(derisive nod to his
retinue)
No one tells me anything.

He comes up to Beowulf and gives him a great hug... then
holds him at a short distance, looking him over, grinning.

I somehow think of you as smaller.

the afternoon! What's to wake?

By the gods it's good to see you!

Perhaps Odin too has woken from his
slumber.
WIDE ON: the group... Hrothgar's guards to one side... the
impressive band of Geats opposite... all joining in SMILES.

As Hrothgar leads them into the hall, the Geats pass...

...Brendan who stands to one side, beatific smile on his
face, apple in hand. He locks gazes with Hondscioh as they
pass, and blesses the group with the sign of the cross.

Hondscioh forces an awkward smile, nods, continues past.
EXT. GRENDEL'S CAVE / SHORELINE CLIFFS —— EVENING 36
CLOSE ON: a human's dried—out HEAD on a cliff—edge facing
inland. Several similar—size rocks sit in close proximity.
The head is almost down to bone, with some skin and a ratty

scalp of hair...

Another rock rolls up toward the head, but comes to rest
before it reaches it.

Silence... then another rock tumbles up toward the head, gets
that much closer, but stops as well.

A snarling EXPLETIVE in Troll—tongue:

GRENDEL
Yahhhg!

REVEAL: Grendel, the rock—thrower, as he takes his stance

once more... MUTTERS reassurance to himself... then heaves a

(high—pitched giddy yelp)
Heeeee!

He struts about, chest swelling... then settles his gaze —
and sigh — on the sunset.

EXT. MEAD HALL —— EVENING 37

The mead hall glows with a profusion of TORCHES — both inside
and out — stunning against the twilight, the great warm haven
it was meant to be.

LAUGHTER and MUSIC from within...
INT. MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 38

The benches are full of warriors and earls, one side the Geat
troop, on the other the Danes...

On the Danes' side, there are considerably more women than
men, the women talking between themselves, flirtatiously
eyeing the revved—up Geats.

ON: Breca scanning several women, his mouth falling open with
nerve—stunned lust. Hondscioh, beside him, reaches over and
nudges his mouth closed.

Between the two groups the fire—pits burn.

LAUGHTER and talk compete with a MUSICIAN playing a HARP, a
SECOND with a bone FLUTE, a THIRD playing a BODHRAN.

Hrothgar sits at one end of the room, Beowulf nearest him.

There's abundant food and jugs of beer being delivered to the
warriors by teenaged ATTENDANTS.

Wealhtheow, passing behind Beowulf, leans in to him,
indicates the numerous women.

WEALHTHEOW
If a Geat were seeking a wife, this
room would hold better hope than
most.

BEOWULF
So many ——

WEALHTHEOW
Widows.
(off Beowulf's look)
Widows far too early.

Beowulf nods, glances across the group and his gaze meets...

...Unferth, who is fixed on him, with an ugly look. Unferth
takes a long draught from his drink, clearly well on the way
to drunk.

Wealhtheow reluctantly pours beer from a jug into the drunk
Hrothgar's cup. With some effort he stands.

AESCHERE
Ho!

And the room goes silent.

Hrothgar looks about, eyes watering. He smiles, but as
quickly gets overwhelmed with emotion. Catches a huge
breath. The grief and fear and hopelessness wash over his
face. He clears his throat, but nothing follows.

He scans the group, shrugs apologetically, LAUGHS — but it's
nothing the others can join in on.

Wealhtheow gently puts a hand on his shoulder, whispers
something in his ear. He nods and lowers himself back to his
seat.

Wealhtheow turns to the assembly.

WEALHTHEOW

With my king I welcome you all.
Too many days we've drunk to forget
the night, and what it brings. But
today we drink to what the day's
brought — thirteen swords against
our curse. Thirteen men to swell
our weary...

(soft, suggestive)
...walls.

Wealhtheow turns to Beowulf and fills his cup.

WEALHTHEOW (CONT'D)
We'll never forget this gift.

And she moves along the row of Geats pouring into each cup.

Beowulf rises, and he too finds himself a bit emotional. His
gaze drifts over the group as he speaks.

BEOWULF

I'll say this once: this is no
gift, coming here is the least I
can do. Danes, you sheltered me as
a child. Some of you here are old
enough to remember. To the rest I
say only I come as a brother.

(beat)
These others with me made their own
minds. We mean to bring an end to
this fiend ——

UNFERTH
(loud mutter)
As others vowed...

WEALHTHEOW
Unferth!
BEOWULF
By your will, dear queen... we're

wiser in knowing the hearts of
those who've tangled with the
thing.

A brief silence through which Unferth and Beowulf lock gazes.

AESCHERE
(sharp / eyeing Unferth)
Those are dead.

UNFERTH

I don't brag of wrestling with it,
nor of being able to kill it.

(beat)
The troll broke down these doors
with twenty Danish warriors
sleeping inside. What gives
thirteen Geats better hope?

HONDSCIOH
We won't be sleeping.

UNFERTH
No — more likely bragging of your
fights with cod—fish.

A coldness sweeps through the room, the Geats on edge.
Aeschere rises, livid, glaring at Unferth.

Hrothgar glances over, blinking up out of his fog.

BEOWULF
(to Unferth)
So, friend — unscathed amidst all
this death — should we guess you've
steered your way clear of bragging?

Unferth gets a wild look, rises from his seat, hand to his
sword—hilt. But just as suddenly Hrothgar has risen, this
time with fury.

HROTHGAR *
Unferth! Sit or see your guts in a *
dish.

Unferth looks suddenly puzzled, the beer fogging his head.
Finally he sits.

Hrothgar eyes the Geats, struggling for focus.

HROTHGAR (CONT'D)

Forgive us forgetting the ways of
kin. Beowulf, if you do as you
vow, there's nothing you can wish
for that won't be yours — if I have
any weight in it.

(beat)
Now, before the dark must sharpen
us again, songs and beer!

As an attendant reaches to pour into Hrothgar's cup, he
covers it with his hand, shakes his head.

The musicians begin again, and the attendants bring more
beer... conversations rising up all around.

EXT. FIELD BEYOND THE DANISH VILLAGE —— EVENING 39

The far—off sound of LAUGHTER from the hall drifts over the
field.

And a dark silhouette rises in the foreground: Grendel,

slowing at the sound. He listens with puzzlement — which
shifts to irritation.

lengthening, arms swinging, landscape streaming under his
feet.

EXT. MEAD HALL / BALCONY —— EVENING 40
As the Geat warriors below and inside set up their equipment,
preparing for an attack — with a drunken Unferth watching

them suspiciously...

...Beowulf and Hrothgar stand on the open balcony, looking

out on the falling dark. Hrothgar's mood is grim... in spite
of the RAUCOUS men below... but he's more clear—headed.
HROTHGAR
Since it began we've had Saxons,
Swedes... even Slavs... coming to

see how weak we were.
Beowulf studies Hrothgar a long beat.

HROTHGAR (CONT'D)
I know. I look like walrus shit.
Comes of fighting things you can't.

Hrothgar manages a weak smile. Beowulf clasps Hrothgar's
shoulder.

BEOWULF
All bad dreams end. We'll see you
in the morning for herring and egg.

HROTHGAR
Herring and egg.

As Beowulf turns toward the battlement... a desperate look
crosses Hrothgar's face, struggling with the things he can't
say.

BEOWULF
If there's anything you need to
tell me about it... now would be

the time.

Hrothgar fights a shudder. Beowulf again takes hold of his
shoulder, steadies him. Hrothgar clenches Beowulf's hand.

They trade smiles. Hrothgar studies Beowulf, sees his steely
resolve. For the first time in ages Hrothgar risks hope.

INT. MEAD HALL —— NIGHT 40A
PAN OVER: the thirteen Geats, some lying on mats on the
floor, some on benches, one or two slumped back in sitting
position against the walls, all with weapons at the ready.
All alert and waiting...

...all except Unferth, who lies back, snoring loudly.

Beowulf sits at the foot of the empty throne, staring into
the embers of the fire—pit, his great sword in his hand.

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / MEAD HALL —— NIGHT 41
Brendan is kneeling at the bottom of a slope leading up to
the mead hall. He is facing the wilds, and quietly PRAYING
in LATIN.

The huge shape of Grendel edges into the light, headed on a
line from the rocks — through Brendan — to the hall.

Brendan, sniffing the air, visibly tenses but continues in
prayer, eyes closed.

Grendel — still yards away — slows to a stop, and takes his
own long sniff of Brendan. Clearly it puzzles him: a man—
smell he's not met before.

As Brendan's prayer increases in breathiness...

...Grendel curves off and around him, then onward up to the
hall.

Grendel leans toward the doors, sniffing — and even more
puzzled by the smells from inside.

INT. MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 44
From outside the sound of Grendel's SNIFFING...

The warriors swing up from their beds, adrenaline of battle
rushing in — but they're cautious to not betray their

readiness — all eyes are open, all mouths closed.

Some men remain squatting; others stand, weapons drawn in
preparation...

EXT. MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 45

CLOSE ON: Grendel holding his forearm horizontally against
the door... seeming to test its strength.

Grendel's head then slumps forward, forehead resting against
the arm. Grendel closes his eyes.

INT. MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 46

There then comes a longer CREAK and a gentle — yet enormous —
pressure on the bolted doors from outside... a great SIGH...

Beowulf, sword at the ready, edges to the door... Hondscioh
and Breca at his side...

There's a silence... the warriors' apprehension building...
...then a prolonged TRICKLE sound...

Beowulf looks down, and immediately jerks back a step,
avoiding...

CLOSE ON: a liquid — Grendel's urine — pooling under the
door.

Beowulf gives his men a look; they all move forward as
Beowulf angrily throws off the locking timber, and swings
open the door, swings back his blade...

...to find only darkness, and the staggering stench of the
troll's piss—mark.

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 46.

EXT. MEAD HALL —— NIGHT 47

ON: Brendan, eyes closed, still praying... as a huge SHADOW —
thrown by the mead hall torches — passes over him...

...a THROATY SNICKER from the passerby, and then he is gone.
Brendan lets out a sigh, but does not open his eyes.
EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / MEAD HALL —— DAY 48

ON: BLACKSMITHS turning glowing pokers against the stained
wood of the great doors... burning off Grendel's urine.

Beowulf, Hondscioh and Hrothgar, amongst others, watch from
one side. Hrothgar is puzzled but relieved.

HROTHGAR
Worse things than a bloodless dawn.

BEOWULF
He let us rest... the worse for
him.

HONDSCIOH
He ever leave men alive in the
hall?

HROTHGAR

Since it began...
Hrothgar shakes his head.
The three men trade a look. Beowulf's drifting gaze finds...

...Brendan, a short distance off, sitting on a rock — almost
indiscernible among the boulders surrounding him. He's
chewing on an apple, studying the others.

Beowulf strides down to him, Hondscioh and Hrothgar
following.

BEOWULF
Priest, where did you spend the
night?

Brendan considers him a moment, then nods to the spot where
he'd been praying.

BEOWULF (CONT'D)

You didn't move at all through the
night?

Why was such a daft wretch spared?

Demon's wise enough to know a
messenger of God! To touch my
cloak's to bring God's very fire
and storm upon its head.

HONDSCIOH
That's not what he asked.

Brendan stares back at Hondscioh a beat, then — ignoring him —
turns to Hrothgar.

BRENDAN
Wise king, you must know the name
of Clovis.

HONDSCIOH
The Frank.

BRENDAN
(faintly condescending)
The Frank, yes. Yes, the Frank.
(beat / intense)
The Christian sword over land ten
times what the Danes hold dear!

BEOWULF
He's dead.
BRENDAN
Did I say he was a god?
(beat)

He's dead, yes, ten years now ——
but not before he saw God's grace:
the Visigoths of Aquitaine, the
Romans under Syagrius, Burgundians,
Alamans all fell before him! And
all because he had God's ear!

And no fucking trolls.

HROTHGAR
And no trolls.

BRENDAN
My skinny hand can only bless. But
trust me — this thing shall meet
its end in striking me... or those
of mine.

Brendan shuffles off. The three share a look.

BEOWULF
Madness has its wonders.

UNFERTH

The Celt sat straight in the path
of the thing... and was not

touched.
The three turn to see a haggard, hungover Unferth approach.

HONDSCIOH

The dead do walk.

BEOWULF
(to Hrothgar)
The Celt held no sword. Perhaps
the thing hates weapons.

But your men were armed.

Hondscioh fixes on Unferth and his sword.

Others here in arms have been

spared.

Unferth gives him a threatening look.

Unferth trembles with indignation, sensing insult, but
there's little to take hold of. He turns and strides away.

HROTHGAR
There walks one of my toughest
fighters. He still is with men...
but the troll stole his spine.

Beowulf broods a beat.

BEOWULF
Do you know where the thing makes
its home?

HROTHGAR

We followed a blood—trail once,
took us to the foot of cliffs...

49 EXT. FLOODPLAIN LEADING TO CLIFFS —— DAY 49
With the steam/mist burning off the water...

... Erik leads Beowulf and the Geats — on horseback — down
the black sand beach, DOGS running ahead...

...to a wall of daunting cliff, at the bottom of which the
dogs sniff and howl.

Beowulf, Hondscioh and Breca consider the challenging climb.

ERIK
This is where the blood trails led.
HONDSCIOH
Not much known to daylight climbs
up that.

Which is why he gets his rest.

Do this climb every night after
supper?

And the others proceed to follow Beowulf.
EXT. CLIFFS —— LATER 50
The Geat troop is edging up the rocky bluff, but warily, the
warriors struggling to gauge the shadows which shift with the
shifting mist.
THORFINN [20s], wiry and vigorous, leads the way now...
...with Beowulf and Hondscioh just a bit back of him.
Hondscioh eyes Erik.
HONDSCIOH
You want to blow your horn now, I
wouldn't mind those fifty bows you
bragged of.
ERIK
I could bring the bows. But the

men are gone .

Beowulf gives Hondscioh a look... but his gaze then fixes
on...

...Thorfinn who, stepping up, takes hold of a jutting hunk of
driftwood for support...

BEOWULF
This is too high up for driftwood.
(warning)
Thorfinn!
As Thorfinn stops and turns, Beowulf urgently scans around...

There comes the SOUND of shifting rock just above Thorfinn.

The piece of wood comes free in his hand, he loses his
footing, and tumbles back...

From a ridge just above him there swings down a great rack of
curved white spikes...

Thorfinn scrambles to the side, just missing impalement...

riverbank, also watching...

naked to the waist, in the middle of the swirling stream.

Brendan, SCREAMING his LATIN against the roar of the falls,
takes up a handful of water, and splashes Unferth in the sign
of the cross.

Hrothgar and Beowulf consider the ritual.
HROTHGAR (CONT'D)

Baptism they call it. Unferth
feels he's fallen from the gaze of

our gods.

BEOWULF
Did Unferth's king give him this
freedom?

You don't fear he has an eye on
your throne?

HROTHGAR
I know he does. My sons are dead.

BEOWULF
From the troll?

HROTHGAR

We game our lives coming here. To

eye.

match.

They're interrupted by Hondscioh and Breca riding up on
horseback. Beowulf breaks eye contact with Selma, glances at
Hondscioh.

HONDSCIOH
The day's going down. If we want
to be ready...

Beowulf nods, and starts back toward the village.

Careful with what you don't

Beowulf turns, eyes her a beat, then continues on with his
boys.

Once out of Selma's earshot, Hondscioh catches Breca's eye,

Something the Saxons do.

BRECA

CONVERSATIONS in the pathways, mild LAUGHTER...

They pass the blacksmith's forge.

The SMITH grins, waves a red—hot axe—head held in tongs. He
gives a forearm/fist of solidarity, and rams the axe—head
down into the water bucket — bursting STEAM.

The three Geats continue on...

...Grimur who is whimpering, cornered into a section of the
barricade, holding up his arms to protect his bleeding head
from stones thrown by a cluster of KIDS.

HONDSCIOH
Ho!

The kids wheel, stones in hand. Seeing who it is, they have
a quick MUTTERING conference but back off a bit. One kid
steps up.

Grimur's got a troll—heart! He

Grimur screeches, falls to the ground, groaning and holding
his head.

As the kid moves to give Grimur a kick, Beowulf steps between
them. He eyes the kids harshly... but the kid is as wild—
eyed as Grimur.

KID
(tremulous)
Grannel killed my brothers!

And Beowulf sees the rage in the child. He places his huge
hand on the kid's trembling shoulder. Indicates Grimur.

BEOWULF
This wretch didn't. But we'll get
the one that did.

The kid meets Beowulf's eye. He calms, turns, leads his
group away.

EXT. MEAD HALL BALCONY —— DUSK 59

As the Geat warriors prepare their troll—watch in the hall
below...

...Beowulf approaches Hrothgar on the balcony.

BEOWULF
I didn't know this thing had a
name.
(off Hrothgar's look)
Even the children know him —
Grannel?

Hrothgar gives a disinterested shrug.
BEOWULF
Has this thing — this Grannel —
killed any children?

Hrothgar thinks a moment, shakes his head.

BEOWULF
Women?

And who cares if he spares the

without their fathers!

BEOWULF
My wits still war with how this all
began.

HROTHGAR
(shrugs)
Hate for the hall, I can only
guess. The night we finished
building it, the foul creep came.
We hadn't seen a troll in

fifteen... maybe twenty years.
BEOWULF
So nothing was done to this troll
itself.
HROTHGAR

(faintly irked)
Beowulf! It's a fucking troll!
Maybe someone looked at it the
wrong way!

BEOWULF
(beat / soft)
Some Dane?

Hrothgar studies Beowulf with faint suspicion.

HROTHGAR
Who hands you this? Selma?

She's been alone in the wilds too
long. Her head's full of spiders,
lap's full of moss.

It's said she sees things.

what it does.

Hrothgar eyes the dimming horizon. Turns, squeezes Beowulf's
shoulder, and starts down the steps back into the hall.

Beowulf scans the ground, the darkness creeping from the
rocks, but his heart remains unsettled.

INT. MEAD HALL —— NIGHT 6O

weapons at the ready. Breca, Hondscioh, Thorkel, Thorfinn —

Beowulf takes up a torch, indicates for Hondscioh to open the

As Beowulf cocks back his torch—hand, ready to throw it...
Hondscioh and Breca throw open the doors...

Hondscioh edges up beside Breca.

O'er the night, the warriors

bog and brine / Crept to those
doors of ten men's weight, / Bade
it creak with breath alone / But
then smelt God amongst the men. /
Hardly had they hoisted steel /
Than the thing's rank guts gave
out. / Great Beowulf, God's awful
arm ——

Enough!

Thorkel stops, turns, sees Beowulf...

THORKEL
(hesitant)
The Celt says Jesus Christ never
sleeps, that he walks amongst us

Thorkel shrugs, strums his harp.

Beowulf crosses the hall toward him...

HROTHGAR
I built this hall to be my home.
Not the stinking grave of my
people. Maybe it should just burn
down.

A silence. Beowulf considers the handsome hall.

BEOWULF
I don't know what else we can do.
He comes here, throws his stones,
pisses, goes. If I knew what
steers his mind ——

HROTHGAR
Beowulf! What steers the mind of a
Slav? What steers the mind of a
Wulfing? They want what's yours so
you have to cut their heads in half

EXT. EDGE OF VILLAGE —— DAY 69B
Beowulf walks along the edge of the village, looking over...

...another whittling a fish from wood.
He passes an old shed, only to find...

...Thorkel on the other side having sex with a young Danish
WIDOW.

Beowulf watches a moment more than he otherwise might...
briefly transfixed... before Thorfinn turns and sees him.

Beowulf turns away...

...continues on over to a field...

...where Breca and Hondscioh are practicing sword—play.

But the two of them are in very different worlds: Breca is
fighting with spectacularly flashy great swings of his great
blade... whereas Hondscioh seems lost in thought — matter—of—
factly blocking Breca's strokes, but making no advances on
his own.

Breca stops, indicates Hondscioh to Beowulf.

Hondscioh had a bad dream.

Beowulf glances at Hondscioh, giving this more respect than
Breca is willing to. Hondscioh shakes his head, dismissive.

BEOWULF

And yours were good?

A trading of swordstrokes. Breca shrugs.

BEOWULF (CONT'D)

Breca gets the shot. Takes a heavy swing at Beowulf which
Beowulf blocks.

BRECA
I don't see fear helping us.

HONDSCIOH
Don't you fucking start ——

BEOWULF
Fear, eh...

And Beowulf takes a couple fierce swings at Breca, under
which Breca staggers back.

The two stare at each other a beat — fire in their eyes.
And Breca strides forward swinging his blade as to cut
through trees. Beowulf — seeing the power — keeps back, till

Breca has spent some of his emotion.

Then Beowulf counters, knocking Breca back till he tumbles
over some uneven ground.

Beowulf stands over him, his blade raised.

EXT. WILDS —— DAY 70

Beowulf edges along on horseback, eyeing the rocky outcrops
with suspicion.

EXT. SELMA'S HUT —— EARLY EVENING 7l
Selma is cooking at her fire—pit.
Beowulf rides up, surprising her, but she quickly masks it.

SELMA
How did you find me?

BEOWULF
Most Danes seem to know the way.

SELMA
Most don't have the guts these
days.

She studies his face, sees a wildness in his eye, resigns
herself.

She puts down the utensils, turns her back to him, spreads
her legs slightly, hikes up her skirt, and bends over against
a railing, offering herself.

Beowulf struggles with his urge.
SELMA (CONT'D)

There's butter in the bowl, if you
need it.

Beowulf averts his eyes.

BEOWULF
I wondered if you threw the stones.

Selma straightens up, drops her skirt.

SELMA
Rune—stones.

Oh no, you don't fear your fate.

It's both a warning and a promise.
SELMA
So. No thoughts at all for my

cunt.

Beowulf looks off: it's not the word he needs to hear right
now.

SELMA (CONT'D)
Warrior—monk, not many of those.

She studies him a beat, then turns and she goes into her hut.
INT. SELMA'S HUT —— DUSK 72

Selma sits on the floor, leaning over the rune—stones as she
shakes them, throws them, and then considers.

Beowulf sits opposite, transfixed by what the V in her
neckline reveals of her chest.

SELMA

The answer's in the stones, not my

breasts.
She looks up at him. He awkwardly shrugs — caught.
There comes agitation from the HORSES outside, STOMPING the
dirt, NEIGHING. An eerie WHISTLING. Beowulf stands, and
draws his sword.
He eyes her a beat. She looks back down to her stones.
And he strides out...

Beowulf watches a moment — in obvious awe — then rushes to
his horse, and mounts it. But, in turning to mount the
horse, he finds...

...the figure already lost from view.

Nonetheless, he edges off in pursuit.

EXT. WILDS / ROCKFACE —— CONTINUOUS 74
Beowulf rides along, though cautiously, due to the mist.
Shapes can be vaguely made out... suggestions of movement,
but they're unresolved, indefinite — keeping Beowulf on his

guard.

There comes a weird unsettling LAUGH... then the sound of
FALLING SCREE to one side...

...and Beowulf veers off the trail...

...coming to a slope which leads up to a more sheer rock—
face. At his feet, dust from the stone—fall is only starting
to settle.

Selma rides up beside him. Beowulf gives her a wary look.

BEOWULF
Was this in the rune—stones?

Selma shakes her head — but in exasperation, not
confirmation.

Beowulf dismounts and starts up the scree—ridden slope.

SELMA
That's less than wise.

BEOWULF
(hint of suspicion)
So your stones say?

SELMA
They don't need to. Most could
see... to climb shifting scree at
dusk... in mist... unless of course

you're a hero...

Well it isn't barking.

A low rumble of a garbled MUTTER [in Old Norse/Icelandic]
from above. Selma smirks.

What?

You can leave or meet your doom.

Beowulf's helmet, infuriating him more.

BEOWULF
Come down here, I swear I'll hammer
these stones right up your hairy
arse!

A long MUTTER, and Selma tries her hardest not to laugh.
Beowulf stares at her, impatient for the translation.

SELMA
He says that might help. He's had
a hard time shitting since the last
Dane he ate.

The sound of shifting scree... and Beowulf raises his
sword... eyeing the mist for a discernible shape. But
nothing comes. A silence.

SELMA
He's gone.

BEOWULF
Why won't he fight me?

SELMA

Why should he? You've done nothing

Swimmer of oceans... able to kill
five Swedes in a stroke of his
great blade...

I only came to help the Danes find
peace.

Selma crosses the threshold into the hut, lights a lamp, then
takes off her cloak. She turns in the doorway and her
breasts shift noticeably beneath the worn—thin cloth of her
blouse. She stares back at Beowulf a beat, then closes the
door.
The sound of a WOODEN LATCH falling into place.

Beowulf, both stunned and aroused, turns and mounts his

HONDSCIOH
Let's leave Christ out of this.

Hondscioh takes a torch and throws it down into the dark.

After only a few seconds it hits rock, and skitters onto damp
ground which it briefly illuminates before CRACKLING out.

BRECA
(to Beowulf)
Not far... but we'll need ropes,

hooks, more torches...
EXT. GRENDEL'S CAVE —— MOMENTS LATER 86
As the troop exits the cave...

...Breca turns back, undoes his pants, and pisses across the
rocks at the entrance.

LAUGHTER from almost all the Geats.
Beowulf manages a smile, until his gaze meets...

...Grimur, whose face betrays worry at this act. Grimur
turns and hurries down the rocks towards the beach.

EXT. BEACH —— MOMENTS LATER 87
As the men near their waiting ship...

...Beowulf, sensing something, hangs back, but does not turn.

He kneels down, appears to adjust a leather thong on his
shoe. Abruptly he wheels around to see...

...a small FERAL child — dark and hairy — staring back as
though frozen by being seen. Their gazes hold several beats,
before the child slips from sight behind boulders.

Beowulf glances back towards his company... all of whom were
oblivious to the sighting. Beowulf turns back to the
rocks...

...catches his breath, gaze scanning over the forbidding
scape.

EXT. DANISH SHORELINE / BEOWULF'S LONGSHIP MOVING —— DAY 88

The men are buoyant — again, all but Beowulf and Grimur at
the rear of the boat, who scan the shore.

THORKEL
...so they came to the cave of the
killer / But found it fled, their
weapons's work / Undone by dark and
the slime of slope. / Hondscioh
nearly fell to Valhalla ——

HONDSCIOH
Let's uh... let this sad tale
sleep.

BRECA

Hondscioh shows up — great Odin and
the others ask how he died, and
Hondscioh goes — I uh... fell?
ROARS of LAUGHTER from the group. Hondscioh eyes Thorkel.

HONDSCIOH
You better find a better line.

As Breca, at the boat's bow, leans back, pulling hard on his
oar...

...a huge creature HAND rises out of the water, bronze arm—
ring flashing in the light, grabs Breca by the hair, and
starts yanking him over.

His oar slams into the other in front of him, alerting the
men.

Thorfinn, beside him, snatches hold of his legs.

The tug is strong, and Breca's head dips below the surface.
As Beowulf rushes the length of the boat...

...Hondscioh, nearer Breca, grabs an oar, and rams it
repeatedly down into the water below Breca.

The creature — hit — loosens its grip, and shifts under the
boat, a mass of long, tangled head—hair trailing... till it
disappears below.

The men haul the unconscious Breca back onto the ship...

...to find bleeding gouges in his shoulder and a tear in his
scalp.

Beowulf, spear in hand, stares down into the water, ready to
strike...

...but there's nothing more to be seen.
INT. MEAD HALL —— NIGHT 89
As the Geats are bedding down...

...Breca — bandaged and grinning — sits before the fire.

BRECA
Even the trolls want my beautiful
hair.
THORFINN
I think he wanted you for more than
that.
LAUGHTER.
HONDSCIOH

Great Breca, the Troll—house
Pisser! I'd be more careful where
I wave my spear.

BRECA
I'd piss in his mouth if he dared

Beowulf sits just outside the door, waiting, listening to the
SOUNDS of the night —— wind, old songs, the sea, laughter...
His eyelids grow heavy. He drifts off...

...into a vision: of the feral boy standing before him. The
child hands him a huge sword, which Beowulf takes.

The boy then opens his shirt, exposing his tiny chest. He
looks from the sword to Beowulf and nods: go on.

Beowulf — heavy—eyed — watches him a beat, blinks, jolts
awake to...

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / MEAD HALL PORCH —— DAY 91
...the glare of daylight.
Silent villagers surround him, puzzling over the tableau:

Further down the steps lies the CORPSE of Grimur, his head
still on, but twisted backwards.

ON: Beowulf, as the shock settles in.
EXT. DANISH SHORELINE / HARBOUR —— DAY 92

Beowulf and his warriors are loading their weapons, as well
as ropes, poles and iron hooks, onto the ship.

Unferth rides up on a horse. Beowulf considers him coolly.

BEOWULF
Seems Grendel doesn't mind killing
Christians... so long as they're
Dane.

UNFERTH
Can another sword help?

Beowulf studies him a beat. Walks up to his side.

BEOWULF

Hrothgar's told me about you and
trolls.

INT. GRENDEL'S CAVE —— MOMENTS LATER 95

The apprehensive warriors, armed with swords, shields,
spears, edge through the damp, stinking place...

Animal and fish carcasses are scattered about.
Each DRIP of water makes someone turn...

Some simple tools... a pile of wood and a fire—pit... but, as
the torches reach the corners of the cave... no Grendel.

Beowulf slumps back against a wall, sighs — relief and
frustration tangled in a mess in his head.

Hondscioh comes upon a small alcove, and discovers within
it...

CLOSE ON: the desiccated HEAD of Grendel's father.
Hondscioh stares in a mix of horror and wonder, then takes it
up by the long braided hair, holds it out before the others
to see...
HONDSCIOH

Look! Our friend Grendel doesn't

come from mist and shit alone.
As the warriors all watch, fascinated...
...Hondscioh throws the huge head into the air, then — as it
falls — he smashes it through with one great swing of his

axe .

Eyes wild, he then smashes the sections into even smaller
pieces.

He stops, catches his breath.

something terrible in what he's done — and they are both
terribly aware.

EXT. GRENDEL'S CAVE —— DAY 96

The men finish piling dry grass and sticks around a great
hunk of driftwood in the cave entrance.

Unferth moves forward torch in hand.
UNFERTH
(fanatical)
For all who've died by the demon's
hand!
Beowulf trades a glance with Breca: who is this madman?...

...after which Unferth throws the torch upon the pile.

The men watch the fire rise quickly up around the wood... the
smoke twisting down into the cave.

scanning the water, spears in hand ready to strike at

Selma is chopping firewood as...

Selma struggles to mask her apprehension.

SELMA
So... is it done?

He wasn't in his cave.

How does he die?

Selma gives an ambiguous shrug, keeps chopping wood.

Beowulf moves toward her, and she wheels, the axe raised and

Unless your teeth can catch an
axe...

Beowulf softens his manner.

BEOWULF
I led my men into this... not
knowing. If I'd known, I'd've come
alone. I see doom hanging over
some of them now. Doom I brought.

Selma considers his concern, lowers the axe.

SELMA
You found the cave.
(beat / hesitant)
That's where I see him... dying.

BEOWULF
And he wasn't there.

SELMA
Would you sit in your cave and wait
for killers who knew the path to
your door?

A silence. Beowulf slumps back against a fish—drying rack.

BEOWULF
What do you know of Christians?

The question catches her off—guard. She considers a moment.

SELMA
They're looking for a father.

BEOWULF
What's wrong with Odin?

SELMA
Odin gets drunk. Wrecks the house.

Beowulf nods. As she puts down the axe, and reaches for
wood...

BEOWULF

Maybe not, but he can sniff you.
Beowulf steers her over to his horse, grabs a rope and binds
her arms to her sides. Selma gives minimal resistance,
seeming more bored than anything with the exercise.

Beowulf lifts her onto her own horse, grabs its reins, mounts
his horse, and leads them off down the trail.

EXT. ROCKFACE —— DAY 99

Beowulf and Selma arrive at the rockface up which Grendel
previously lurked. Beowulf dismounts, turns to the rockface.

BEOWULF
What's the way up from here?

SELMA
Straight... but you'd need claws.

Beowulf looks at her darkly, circles.
Selma gives him an ever—so—faintly—contemptuous look.

SELMA
Then again, heroes ——

He turns on her, volatile, barely in control. She almost
snarls:

SELMA
You hit me, I'll be the one ——

She stops herself, but Beowulf's heard enough to wonder.

BEOWULF
One to what?

Selma looks away.

Beowulf takes out his knife. He looks like he could do
anything with it. For the first time she looks unsure.

But he pulls her around and cuts the lash from her wrists.

Beowulf studies her a beat, then remounts his horse.

BEOWULF
Careful which side you end up on.
You're a long way from the village.

SELMA
You're a longer way from home.

Beowulf eyes her a beat, then turns and rides off.
INT. GRENDEL'S CAVE —— DAY 100

Through the smoky cave, Grendel comes staggering, coughing,
squinting through the stinging haze...

He drops to his knees, continues along...

Finally his extended hand comes upon the now—empty alcove.
He twists about, hands then desperately searching the nearby
ground.

One hand clutches something, brings it up into his sight...

CLOSE ON: one half of the facial portion of his father's
skull.

Grendel gasps, brings the piece to his face, sniffs it, and
his eyes go hard.

He emits a long HOWL — an eerie mix of sorrow and rage.

INT. MEAD HALL —— NIGHT 102
With Hondscioh asleep on the next bench over...

sleep.

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / PERIMETER —— NIGHT 103
The silence of the night.

PAN DOWN: the outer stone perimeter... to a GUARD impaled on
a wooden spike.

And Grendel continues through the boulders,, the blood caked
heavy on his face, his eyes wide, almost trance—like.

INT. MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 104

A long silence... then the very faint sound of BREATHING on
the other side of the doors.

The oak doors begin to creak... with an awesome and steady
pressure. As the doors bend in...

...Beowulf twists toward them. There's resignation on his
face: his fate shall now come. He takes his battle breath.

BEOWULF
Wake up, men, or never again!

There's the sudden CRACK of splitting wood, and the doors'
securing beam snaps apart.

The warriors leap up, taking hold of weapons.
The doors fly open and Grendel — silhouetted — charges in.
Beowulf, no weapon in hand, rushes toward him...

...but Grendel, as quickly, shifts into the darkness.

...Grendel shifts past him, snatches up the still—blinking
Thorkel — sniffs him — not what Grendel is looking for.

Grendel flings him to one side...
...reaches and snatches up the next one — Hondscioh.
As Hondscioh struggles to get his sword in play, Grendel
pulls Hondscioh's other hand to his face, sniffs him once to
make sure...
GRENDEL
(soft / in Old
Norse/Icelandic)
For my father.

...then deftly snaps his neck.

ON: Beowulf turning just in time to see... and his horror
gives way to fury.

As Beowulf charges towards him...

...Grendel twists around and throws Hondscioh's corpse at
him, knocking him down.

As Beowulf struggles out from the grim embrace of his dead
friend...

...Grendel reaches for Breca, but a sword swings down and
slashes Grendel across the upper arm. Grendel, seething,
turns to find...

...Unferth there, bringing back his sword for another swing.

UNFERTH
By Christ, demon, you shall die!

But before he can swing his sword...

...Grendel backhands him, sending him flying against the
outer wall.

Grendel reaches again for Breca... but his arm is waylaid...

Beowulf's other hand grabs Grendel by the hair and tugs back
his neck.

A spear, thrown by a Geat, slams against Grendel's chest but
bounces off. Beowulf, tugging Grendel into the torchlight,
only then sees...

...the iron—mail—shirt binding Grendel's torso.

Grendel stares into Beowulf's face. They're frozen for a
moment...

...there's almost sadness — wonder — in their looks...

...then Grendel throws back his arm — Beowulf still attached —
and the two tumble back against the wall.

They wrestle across the floor, tumble over benches, through
tables...

...the other Geat warriors circling, weapons raised to
strike.

But the target is impossible to fix on... the two figures —
Grendel and Beowulf — twisting about as one.

Finally Grendel smashes Beowulf against the wall, and gets
free of one of Beowulf's hands.

He turns toward the door, meaning to escape, but finds...
...a massive fishing NET dropped across the exit, and,
between it and him, a cluster of strong and determined Geats
standing with spears and shields levelled at him...

...but, worse than that, Beowulf is still holding on.

Grendel smacks Beowulf again against the wall, forcing
Beowulf's grip to loosen. Grendel tugs free...

...and scrambles up the wall like a monkey to the second
floor.

Beowulf, with blood gushing from his face, runs up the stairs
after him.

Grendel, finding the upper balcony door bolted, smashes at it
till it starts to give way.

But then Beowulf is once again upon him.

As Grendel, dragging Beowulf, struggles to the railing...
...Beowulf frees one of his hands long enough to snatch hold
of a hanging rope, which he then deftly knots about the wrist

of Grendel's already—gouged—and—bleeding arm.

Grendel swings wildly back with his other arm, but Beowulf
avoids it... though he lets go his grip.

Grendel snarls, then vaults over the railing...

...but drops only a few feet before the rope snaps taut, his
full weight wrenching down on the shoulder joint. A
sickening POP as the arm dislocates from the socket. He
SCREECHES pain...

ON: Beowulf wincing at the scream... *

CLOSE ON: the shoulder muscles, already cut, continue to
shift and TEAR from the strain...

ground.

Beowulf brings up a spear, is trying to line it up for a *

EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 106

As the Geat warriors spill out through the doorway, they are
just as quickly mesmerized...

fiercely jams the spear point back in — this time, at the

muscle and sinew of his distended shoulder.

The spear—gouge does its work: the flesh finally shreds, the
arm tearing off from the shoulder...

...and Grendel drops in a heap to the ground.

The warriors freeze, staring.

Grendel struggles to his feet, turns on them — SCREECHES —

charges through the standing warriors — bowling several over —

Grendel comes through rocks, out onto the pebble beach. He
staggers forward, tumbles to his knees, rises... staggers
several blind steps more... until his feet reach the water,

and only then does he let his legs come to rest.

He's almost falling as he stands, blood draining into the
water.

Hrothgar roars with LAUGHTER, Beowulf laughing as well.
Tears start streaming from Hrothgar's eyes.

HROTHGAR

I tell you... I tell you... if he

More hysterical laughter and tears... and gradually the mask

gasps... the fear climbing back into his eyes.

Beowulf pats his shoulder.

It's over now. The troll's dead.

Wealhtheow comes up, sees Hrothgar's state.
WEALHTHEOW

So... is this more or less as you

hundreds of figures frozen in the light...

SELMA
We'd all heard tales when we were

in the spring... or clear of
icebergs when they were calving.
The wilds were harsh, you could

told us trolls lived there...

A shape in the middle distance abruptly turns, rises: it's
Grendel.

122 INT. SELMA'S HUT [FLASHBACK] —— NIGHT 122

Selma — half—a—dozen years younger — lies in bed, edging to
sleep. Only the sound of the WIND and the SEA...

Then the CREAK of her door edging open. Selma turns, sees...

...Grendel slowly fill the doorway, enter the hut, sniff
around, eye her.

SELMA
One night Grendel found my hut.

Grendel crosses the room, huge, hulking... and MUTTERING a
low apology.

Selma, petrified, closes her eyes, mutters prayers, curled up
beneath her blanket.

Grendel reaches out and pulls back the blanket, pulls Selma
up by the hips...

Grendel is methodically thrusting into Selma from behind.
She is crying quietly, gasping, her eyes wide in confusion...

Grendel climaxes with little apparent emotion — just a few
breaths heavier than previously — then he places Selma back
on her bed, face—down, and pulls the blanket back up over
her.

Selma remains where she is, in shock... but no longer crying,
only softly panting from the effort, and the fear as it ebbs
away... her eyes wide...

...and, as Grendel's breathing also softens, there comes the
CREAKING steps of his exit...

...the door opening... SOUNDS of the wind and sea...

Thing is, he never took me again.

SELMA
Keep the Danes away. The ones
who'd fuck me then cut my throat.

Beowulf sees her now in profile, her eyes wet, her skin
shimmering in the flicker of fire—light. Her beauty. He
edges up to her.

She turns, studies him, then backhands him hard in the face.
He staggers back a step, more stunned than offended.

BEOWULF
Where did that have its birth?

SELMA
You thinking you can tie me up and
drag me like a dog.
(beat)
Don't forget. I know how you die.

Beowulf is jolted. Almost as much as when she rises up to
him and kisses him — hard.

They tentatively reach for each other.

She abruptly pulls him to her, driving her face along the
sides of his throat, feeling his hair against her cheek.

He kisses her face and she swings her mouth to his — kisses
him hungrily.

As their hands explore each other's bodies...

Selma works her way across his chest — the first time she's
had this control in years — if ever at all.

BEOWULF
(wry).
Been a thle?

SELMA
With men... yeah.

Beowulf gets it like the slap. She laughs.

She steers him back onto a bench, then raises her skirt and
straddles his lap.

He kisses back — finally getting the picture — and they tear
into each other... fiercely, rather like animals.

I'm tellnya, Christ, y'thought the
Celts were work... But these — it's

one hand on their sword, the other
on their dick... Which hand they'll
use to cross themselves, I almost
fear to ask...
He looks up from the ground just as...
...a huge HAND sweeps out from the dark at him...
...and slaps his face... SNAPPING his neck.

He spins a step or so in a deadman's dance — then collapses
to the ground.

And a great SHAPE moves over him.
INT. MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 127
The oak doors edge open, and a [two—armed] troll edges in.

CLOSE ON: the shadowed face as it SNIFFS. Fierce black eyes
scan.

As the troll moves into the light from the fire—pit embers,
her breasts are discernible beneath her hide—shift, as is her
wild and grizzled mane: it's Grendel's mother — the SEA—HAG.
She's the same genesis as Grendel, slightly smaller — but
with greater vengeance. Bronze snaking arm—rings encircle
her powerful forearms.

She edges between the sleeping warriors, more cautious than
her son, till her eyes alight on...

...Grendel's arm nailed to the rafters.

Grief is quickly overwhelmed by fury. She tears the arm down
off its spike. As she turns...

...the WARRIOR nearest to her stirs and looks up. She grabs
him by the throat, SHRIEKS, and throws him into the fire—pit.

A SECOND WARRIOR rises.

As the warriors now struggle out of sleep, she strides
purposely for the door, her son's arm clutched under her own.

As she nears the door, Aeschere steps in front of her, sword
drawn, blocking her path.

AESCHERE
Learn from your child, hag!

He swings his sword with all the strength he can muster...

...but she blocks it with her son's arm, the blade lodging in
the flesh. She snatches hold of Aeschere, and pulls him to

her in a lethal hug... the SOUND of his bones SNAPPING as she
does...
EXT. DANISH VILLAGE / MEAD HALL —— CONTINUOUS 128

LS: of the Sea—Hag lurching out of the hall, one arm carrying
Grendel's arm, the other dragging a corpse by the hair.

As she disappears into the dark...

rocks.

He pulls back and scurries away...

immediately.

He bends, reaches for the arm...

...and that is entirely what he gets: Aeschere's arm torn
from its socket... and no body in sight.

Hrothgar gasps horror, drops the arm, and staggers back, his
eyes glazing in shock.

Breca shakes his head, then indicates Unferth.

BRECA
But they did.

Unferth strides about the clearing, torch in hand, fiercely
staring into the dark.

He turns to the hut and starts setting it afire.

As the fire rises, Beowulf and Breca share a weary look, roll
their eyes.

Unferth vigorously swings the torch in the sign of the cross.

The warriors come down to the beach on which they previously
found the bloody signs of Grendel's death—throes. This time
they come upon...

...a blood—caked HEAD, propped on a stick. Breca rides up,
looks it over, turns back to Beowulf.

BRECA
It's Aeschere.

Unferth bolts forth on his horse, dismounts hurriedly, draws
his sword and waves it at the beach.

UNFERTH

Aeschere! We will right this

wrong! God will burn this devil—

bitch—fiend!

He bends low, peers along the water's edge. He climbs down
into the water.

BRECA (CONT ' D)

Beowulf?

BEOWULF
Cave doesn't end here. There's
outflow...

descends into the water.

EXT. UNDERWATER / CHANNEL —— CONTINUOUS 139
Beowulf makes his way along the murky channel, the ceiling at
most a foot above the water, in many spots entirely

submerged...

...the only light filtering up through the water from the
cave.

A wash of water smacks him against the rock.

He gulps water — chokes — gasps for air.

Clinging to an outcrop, he regains his breath. Continues on.
The ceiling now descends a foot into the water.

But — through the murk — he can make out some form of BLUISH
LIGHT bleeding through the water from beyond the next rock.

He steels himself, takes the deepest breath he can, then
dives down into the water, legs furiously kicking...

INT. SEA—HAG'S ICE—CAVE —— CONTINUOUS 140
Beowulf bursts up out of the water...

...into an ice—cave, through one wall of which the outside
light faintly glows.

Cautiously he edges out of the water, onto the sand.

Against one wall is a pile of treasure, gilded weapons,
shields, and the skeleton heads of humans...

He continues on into the semi—dark of a rock passage and
almost stumbles over...

...Grendel's corpse. The arm—socket wound has been sealed
with pitch... but too late for Grendel. Blood saturates the
sand.

A few feet away lies the great torn—off arm.

Beowulf turns the head by its hair, peers into the face...
...when a SHRIEK comes from behind. He wheels...

...and the Sea—Hag is upon him.

She wildly claws at him with one hand, while trying to stab
him with the knife she holds in the other.

Beowulf breaks free of her, swings with his sword, but it
hardly cuts through the walrus—hide.

She strikes out and her fingernails tear across his ribs. He
falls into the water, and she leaps upon him.

They wrestle, twisting under the surface...

...then rise, Beowulf having slipped behind her and taken
hold of her hands...

She lurches backwards, smashing him against the rocks...

As his grip loosens, she swings him partway in front of her,
slashes down one arm with her knife... and his blood pours
from the wound...

Beowulf stumbles clear of the Sea—Hag, eyes...

...a giant's sword in the treasure pile, of which he takes
hold.

She SCREECHES pain, twists about, eyes going blind, and
collapses into the water...

...blood gushing from her and staining the water...
...as Beowulf collapses in the sand.
Beowulf trudges back to Grendel's corpse, stands over it...

...when he hears a sound — a living GASP — from behind him.
He wheels around...

...but the Sea—Hag lies where she was, half her body in the
water, the other half in the sand.

Beowulf leaves Grendel, edges past the fire—pit toward the
darker recesses of the cave. Edging around a rock, he
sees...

...the GLIMMER of a blade, and raises his own, prepared to
strike. As he moves another step forward, he's confronted
by...

CLOSE ON: the feral boy, hiding in the rocks, holding a
dagger out at Beowulf, terror in his tear—ridden eyes...

...but the boy then charges wildly, slashing with his dagger.
Beowulf shifts clear of the charge...

...and the child continues over to the body of Grendel, where
he wheels around, squats down, dagger extended, protecting
the corpse.

Beowulf studies him a beat, Beowulf's sword still raised.

BEOWULF
Your father.

It's unclear if it's a challenge or only confirmation.

The child, sensing it's the former, swallows, then defiantly
nods, preparing to be attacked.

Beowulf, eyes still frenzied, blinks through the blood on his
face. Shakes the dizziness from his head.

He stares dully a long beat... his mind twisting around on
itself. Finally he softens, sighs, lets his sword drop to
his side.

BEOWULF (CONT'D)
Then you can be proud.

The two study each other a beat...
...then Beowulf turns, starts back toward the water.
A GASP to one side of Beowulf. He twists around to find...

...the Sea—Hag, eyes blood—blinded, trudging slowly toward
him. He raises his sword, point held outward.

The Sea—Hag slows to a teetering stop several feet from him.
Her bloody hands vaguely explore the air before her.

Beowulf's expression softens...

...and, in that moment, one of her hands snaps out, and grabs
hold of the extended blade.

Beowulf, transfixed, holds his ground.

The Sea—Hag then — incrementally — edges forward till the
blade—point touches her abdomen. She lets out a painful
breath.

And then, teeth clenched, she edges forward again.

She lets out a GASP as the sword penetrates her skin.

Her head falls back, the wild hair shifting off her face,
revealing features of fierce beauty.

Beowulf — overwhelmed and transfixed — lets go of the sword,
and shifts out of the way.

The Sea—Hag continues forward. Finally, the sword—hilt meets
the wall of the cave. She feels the resistance...

...drags in a breath...

...then pushes forward, the sword moving through her, and
emerging out her back.

She sighs, staggers a couple steps, then falls back dead,

Beowulf & Grendel — 10th dr. — Berzins — July 12/04 — 118.
CONTINUED: 149

Beowulf looks across to the shore, and sees through the
fog...

...the feral child following along the rocks.

Beowulf watches as...

...the child comes to the end of the rocky spit. The fog
clears enough to reveal, on the rocks several feet above
him...

...Selma standing, driftwood in hand, also watching them go.

CLOSE ON: her face... and the ghost of a smile.

The fog thickens, mother and child disappearing into the
land.

Beowulf blinks, his eyes now watering. He wipes them, looks
again...

...but there's nothing visible but rock and water.
Beowulf turns his grim gaze back to the sea.

BEOWULF
By Odin's will...

Unexpectedly to Beowulf, a chorus of voices of the other
Geats rise in the prayer:

UNISON
...let us find our way home.

Beowulf looks out over the others, all of whom are fixed on
him.

He nods, and turns his gaze...
...back out on the sea.
FADE OUT.

END END END
