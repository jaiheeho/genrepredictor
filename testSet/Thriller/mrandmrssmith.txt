John finds his parked sedan. A black Benz. In a mass of other
sedans. Almost in unison, commuters climb into cars.

INT. JOHN'S CAR — DUSK

While other sedans rumble to life, John performs a ritual: he
SHELLS his hands. Pulls out air—freshener. Sprays his wrists.
Wrings his hands together. Then smells. Good.

Under the wheel, he slips his wedding RING out of a pocket,
onto his finger. He checks pockets. Petting himself down
fast. Be STOPS when he sees what looks like red lipstick on
his cuff.

He checks his neck in the mirror. A smear of blood red
lipstick. Hmmm. Having an affair...?

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS — DUSK

John drives at the back of an endless line of sedans. He
drifts into the driveway. The garage door opens.

John spots Jane through a window. His HEADLIGHTS splash
across her face. They wave, smile. But as John pulls into

A hint of edge in her voice.

Jane smiles weakly, trying to win the Baby over. A heat.
And the Baby.........emiles. Even giggles.

MON #4
She likes you.

Jane smiles‘back. A real, relieved smile. Through a haze of
cigar smoke, she sees...John. They look eyes. No real
passion. A long way from their first glance. They both look a
little disgusted with each other. Suburban suckers.

looks like a CAR GRAVEYARD.

Moving across the highway, John reaches the median, where he
sees Jane: a small figure emerging from.the avalanche snow—
pile down the road. She heads into a tunnel. John pursues.

INT. TUNNEL w NIGHT

Lit with the crackle and flash of downed electricity cables.
John enters a service corridor off the main tunnel.

John looks around. No sign of the figure. Then suddenly... a
SHADOW drops down BEHIND him from above. JANE's eyes blaze
through the darkness as she attacks like a tiger.

A graceful spin and John's down from a reverse spinning
roundhouse. He goes for a gun but she hooks his hand between
her ankles in midwair, FLIPPING him, sending the gun flying.

John tastes blood, raises his fists. They circle each other.
Feints, sudden moves. Black belt vs. Golden Gloves. Testing

for weaknesses. Jo jitsu kicks at ankles, knees. John throws
punch after punch, getting closer. She dodges but can’t stop
his onslaught. She drops, cracks both his shine with a halfs
brick. He gasps in pain and falls to his knees.

Moving behind him she executes a neck hold, drags him towards
a ragged steel pole sticking out of a discarded road sign.

John is choking. Jane pushes him towards the sharp metal
point, inches from his eye. John spots his gun five feet
away. Reaches behind and grabs the crotch of Jane’s pants.
Squeezes. No effect. What?

He twists his shoulders and relaxes his arms. They both fall
towards the spike but John angles himself, missing it and
SLASHING THE BACK OF JANE'S SHOULDER. She gasps in pain.

Suddenly free, John crawls towards his gun. He spins and
aims. Nothing. He looks around the silent darkness. Turns on
his head lamp: something disappears back into the tunnel.

He is met by the blinding light of a NIGHT SUN and the wind
and noise of A CHOPPER. He just catches a glimpse of his
adversary on a ROPE LADDER swinging under the huey before the
CHOPPER opens fire with a minigun, forcing him back into the
tunnel.

really looking at his wife, for the first time in years.

INT. SMITH HOUSE — NIGHT

Jane leads into the front hall. Shifting sideways, checking
mirrors. Never fully turning her back. John unzipe hie coat.

INT. SMITH HOUSE — DINING ROOM — NIGHT
The room is decked out. Candlelight. Romantic.

JOHN
You did all this for me?

JANE
I missed you.

JOHN
I missed you too honey.

Jane holds the chair out for John. He site. She takes the .
napkin, gives it the tiniest of whiporacks and lays it on his
lap. John looks at her.

JOHN (CONT‘D)
Why thank you.

JANE
Don’t mention it.

She walks around his back. He tenses. She skips out through

the kitchen door. John is left uncomfortably alone for a few
seconds before she reappears suddenly with a steaming roast.
She stands beaming. Behind her through the swinging kitchen

door John sees a bottle of Draino on the counter.

JOHN
Mmmi Pot roast. My favorite.

The carving knife lifts into View as Jane sharpens it. John
watches her every move. The KNIFE glints in her hand.

John pauses, forkful in hand, sees Jane watching, swallowe.

JOHN
So the problem's...eolved?

JANE
Not yet. But don't worry. It's
nothing we can't handle.

Jane sees a BANDAGE ON JOHN‘S EAR. HIS KNUCKLES: faint
ABRASIONS. A MEMORY FLASH: John throws PUNCHES in the TUNNEL.

BACK TO THE TABLE. John motions to the pot roast.

JOHN
Mmm. This is great. You do
something new?

JANE
You always ask if—

JOHN
1 always forget how good it is.

An intensity to his words. New meaning now.

JANE
You sure you don‘t want any salt
with that?

John shakes his head. Eyes narrow, swallowing. Jane reaches
out toward her glass. A clean, straight line. A MEMORY FLASH:
A MATCHING MOVE FROM THE FIGHT IN THE TUNNEL. A perfect line.

 

RETURN To DINNER. John swallows hard. Thinking.

JANE (come)
So tell me, how was your day?

JOHN

Had a problem with some figures.
Something didn’t add no.

Jane distruste. Covers.

JANE

She opens the package, maybe expecting a trick. But what she
finds is: a beautiful sleek black dress.

JANE (CONT'D)
It‘s beautiful.

JOHN
Why don’t you try it on?

Jane slips her clothes off and slips the dress on. She looks

for a second so he completely misses his chance to look at
her shoulder. She smiles.

JANE
So how do I look?

she stays close, pushing her body against his. Locking eyes.

JOHN
Like a whole new woman.

John holds her close. Behind her back, he looks at the
retlection in his wine glass. The light catches it. And...

John drooe the glass. We zoom in to the glass as it falls. AN
AVALANCHE OF MEMORIES. LIGHTNIKG»S?EED, STYLIZED FLASHES span
three seconds:

FLASHBACK: TEE HOTEL IN BOGOTA ~ DAX

John and Jane in the hall. Their first meeting. Apgroaching
each other. John tucks in his shirt.

And we SWIVEL FAST AROUND HIM...to see him tuck a tiny
revolver into his belt.

Jane smooths her skirt. We SWIVEL FAST AROUND HER...to see
her slip a thin blade into her stocking. And we’re back at——

THE STREET MARKET IN BOGOTA. REVERSE MOTION. The bullet PULLSIOBA
OUT of Sancho Varron. Flying backward high-speed into...

The barrel of a gun. A quick flash of an EYE EN THE
SCOPESIGHT. JANE’S EYE.

INT. BEDROOM — NIGHT

John looke into the same eye. Silence. Hie glass finally HITS

the ground. SHATTERING. Staining the rug BLOOD RED. John and
Jane push back.

JANE

JOHN
No. i’ll get it.

INT. DEN — NIGHT

He shuts the door behind him. Banting. Mind racing. A door
SLAMS shut 0.8. John flinohes. Bar to the door. Nothing. He
rips open his desk. Hidden compartment. Pulls out a silencer,
clipr pistol. THWACK. Gun assembled. on his hip.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Candles flicker. An empty room. John on high alert.

JOHN (SWEETLY)

He moves from room to room. Blood beating. He hears: THE
GARAGE DOOR OPENING.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD — NIGHT

A LIGHT SNOW FALLS. SCREEECHI Jane’s wagon broadsides round
the bend leaving a wake of snow. SCREEECHI John's sedan
slingshots around the corner, onto the interstate highwayw—

EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY — NIGHT

The chase is on. John and Jane weave through traffic. Jane's
wagon shudders at the speed.

JOHN
That‘s my wife. My goddamn wife.

John gains ground. 90,95 MPH. Trying to gather himself.

JANE (TO HERSELF)
You lied to me.

She drops a gear and floors it. The engine roars.

John PUNCHES the gas harder. Weaving. He catches up to her.
They SWERVE toward each other.

JOHN
Don’t dent the Honda. Don‘t dent
the fuckin' Honda.
Fighting for a lane. Their CARS hump and grind. SPARKS FLY.
JOHN (CONT'D)

Great. Trash every car we own why
don’t oha?

John swerves around a van and draws level. Jane sees the
silenced gun in his hand on the wheel.

JANE
Shit. He’s armed.

She reaches under her seat and pulls out a Sig and high
capacity clip. She locks and loads. John looks across.

JOHN
Shit. She’s packin'.

He PUNCHES the brakef swerves in behind her. She stamps on
the brakes.

John, tailmgating, sees the "KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!" sticker fly
toward him. On impact, he accidently squeezes off a round. A

Smill slug ZINGS through his windscreen, through ten feet of

freezing country air, and through the Honda’s rear window.

JOHN (CONT‘D)
Now look what you made me do.

Jane flinohes as a round passes her ear, out the windshield.

JANE
You bastard!

She swivels in her seat and empties Ten Massive .45 calibre
rounds behind her which SING into John's car. John eats
passenger seat, showered with broken glass.

JOHN
That's it. Over—react.

John accelerates and moves into her lane. His car is bigger,
stronger. She BOUNCES away.

JANE
Get out of my lane goddamn it.

Jane opens fire again. John ducks down again.

JOHN
That's it. That's the tin lid.

He reaches over and pulls a plastic GAS CAN from the
footwell. He tears off his shirtmarm, stuffing it in and
screwing the lid back on.

JOHN (CONT'D)
See how you like it.

John puts pedal to metal. 115, 120. Edging ahead, he lights
the fuse on his makeshift gas~bomb and hurls it out the
window. It hits the center of Jane's windshield EXPLODING on
impact, wreathing her hood in flames.

Jane can’t see for fire. She stays cool, hunching down in her
seat, swapping her hand for her foot on the gee. She braces
both feet against the windshield and KICKS, it neatly pops
out.

John sees the flaming glass cartwheel toward him. He BRAKES
HARD, as it catches his side door. Jane smiles.

Frustrated, John FLOORS IT. Side by side, they lock eyes at
lZSMPH. A flicker of...electricity...attraction? John shouts.

JOHN (CONT‘D)
We need to talk!

Jane SLAMS HER BRAKES, as John SWERVES TOWARD HER. So... John
SWERVES PAST THE FRONT OF HER CAR at 130MPH. He looks ahead
to see: AN OFF-RAMP INCOMING. He fishtails. SMASH! He SLAMS
INTO THE RAMP WALL. CRASHING through the concrete.

He swallows hard, shutting his eyes. As his car goes
AERBORNEI FLYING OFF THE RAMP. SOARING THROUGH THE NIGHT.
NOSE—DIVING into the Hudson. IMPACT. SPLASH!

The car sinks fast. LEGHT hits the water. Jane stands on the
bank: police maglight on her left shoulder, pistol in her
right hand sweeping the river. No sign of John. A heat.

Still no John. No bubbles... She hears SIRENS. COPS incoming.
With a last glance at the river, Jane drives into the night.

EXT. RIVER — NIGHT

Water swirls. Beyond the waves...on the other side of a rusty
old buoy... John bobs. Alive. His eyes flash. Not so much
angry as... IMPRESSED. Impassioned. Ready for war.

We hear a DING DONG on the CUT TO—«

touching the top of the bin. Trapped.

John tries to pull his gun. CLANGL His gun is in the OUTSIDE

Jane spots this, grabs his hand and applies locking pressure

Oh so this is a trap?

Jane gives a little sliver of smile. Cat with mouse.

John checks the emergency hatch again. Too high.

JOHN
So what you got up there, a shaped
charge on the counterweight cable
and two more on the primary and
secondary brakes?

JULIE
He knows.

Jane smiles. Slightly...impraesed.

the leather smoke. Below we see the severed counterweight
cable unravelling and SNAKING ITS WAY UP THE SHAFT. John
braces himself. As the tip of the parted cable passes like a
wire ball, it catches his belt, pulling him up.

HE SCREAMS IN PAIN AS HE EXPERIENCES MASSIVE GwFORCE. Having
dropped nearly 30 floors he now flies upwards 40.

But John HOLDS TIGHT, RIDING the snaking cable UP through the
shaft as the elevator falls away beneath him, filling the
darkness with the sound of WHISTLING METAL. As he nears the
top he sees the cable ripping through huge smoking pulleys.

He braces as he reaches the pulley. The belt gets pulled

drape it into his lap and Wedges it under the table.

Time freezes. The barrel shakes on his gun.

John looks into his wife‘s eyes. And he cannot pull the

Listening to Bing Crosby. In a minivan. Jane considers.
Spooked. Shaking her head softly.

JANE
Who was that guy? A pro?

JOHN
If he isn‘t, then he sure takes his
hobbies seriously.

JANE
He was a pro.

JOHN
Fuckers get younger every year.

John checks the rear-view mirror.
JOHN (CONT'D)

close to you?

A SLEEK, SILVER BMW SEDAN CHARGES toward them!

CONTINUED:

Assassin works the wheel, shiting the clutch brilliantly. He
reaches out with an AUTOMATIC, FIRES at the minivan, SHREDS
the back door.

Jane grabs John’s 45. She climbs into the passenger section.
AND BING CROSBY CROONS OVER THE FOLLOWING ACTION:

Jane crawls on her stomach, POPPING down two rowa of
RECLINING SEATS. She sloooowly RECLINES THE LAST ROW. USING
THE SEAT~BACK AS A SHIELD. She aims over the seat at...

The Assassin's BMW. Jane FIRES! But John SWERVES wildly,
darting around TRAFFIC. Jane's BULLETS miss high and wide.

JANE
JOHNS HOLD STEADY!

John struggles to control the minivan. A.heavy load.

JOHN
Transmission's terrible: How the
hell do people drive these things?£

Jane sees...A BLACKED—OUT EXPLORER swing into lane, joining
the hunt. TWO YOUNG KILLERS in the front seats. More suits.
Jane’s eyes narrow. Thinking. She crawls back to the front.

JANE
Give me the wheel. John...

He pauses. He wants to be in control. Jane reasons:

JANE (cont'd) {CONT’D}
I drive a station—wagon and a van.
; know how to drive these things.
(extending the 45)
And this is what yon do.

John looks at her. Motions to the wheel.

JOHN
Take it.

As John and Jane shift positions, their bodies BRUSH. Flesh
twisting, turning. Intimate, sexual. For a splitnsecond...
They get caught up in the heat. And WHAM! The Assassin SLAMS
into the minivan. SNAPPING John and Jane back to action.

John crawls into the back. Jane adjusts the rearwview mirror
to her height. Her eyes narrow, focused. Ready to battle with
her suburban tank. She SPEEDS up the ON—RAMP to—m

EXT. In95 HIGHWAY — DAY

John AIMS over the back row of seats. Heavy machineeGUNFIRE
explodes from the Explorer. Eating windowg from the rear.

The Assassin switches gears, RACING up the DRIVER~SIDE.

JOHN
Incoming! YOUR SIDE!

Jane checks her side—view—mirror.

JANE
Hold oni

John grabs a seat belt. Jane reaches back over her shoulder.
She hits the SIDE—DOOR LOCK. She PUNCHES the BRAKES.

And the SIDE—DOOR SLIDES OPEN. Giving John a CLEAR SHOTE

 

John FIRES pointmblank! Bullets SHOOT through the Assassin's
passenger«side windows. WHIZZING by his head.

In one fluid motion: the Assassin HITS his brakes, SWINGS
around the back of the van, and HAMMERS the gas. Speeding up
along the other side of the van. But he finds a surprise:

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VAN HAS A SLIDING DOOR TOO. JOHN IS
WAITING. DOOR OPEN. GUN HIGH. ELAN! The Assassin VEERS HARD!

Fuming, the Assassin SWERVBS at the minivan. But the van is
too strong. His BMW BOUNCES off. Jane’s eyes narrow.

JANE (CONT‘D)
Buckle up, John.

John straps on a seatbelt. And Jane SWERVES HARD! SLAMMING
into the SIDE OF THE BMW! The BMW doors BUCKLE. The minivan’s
doors hold STRONG! TOTALLY INTACT.

JANE (coum'n)
Steel—reinforced side—imoact
intrusion-beams. Standard on all
'99 minivans.

John looks at her. How the hell did she know that?

 

JANE {CONT'D}
Those dinner~perties are starting
to pay off.

CONTINUED:

The Assassin tries to PUSH OFF the minivan. But the van is
too heavy. Jane is PLOWING the BMW ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. TOWARD
THE EDGE OF AN OVERHANG. Suburban is beating urban.

 

The Assassin is trapped, helpless. He reaches out with his
gun, FIRING at the minivan's wheels. BLOWING out a FRONT
TIRE:

But Jane HITS THE FOUR—WHEEL—DRIVE FUNCTION. And her BACK-
WHEELS smoke into motion. PUSHING the BMW all the way to...

THE EDGE OF THE OVERHANG. WHAM11 The Assassin‘s car SLAMS
through the low stanchion. Flies off the overhang!

THE BMW PLUMMETS FIFTY FEET, TWISTENG AND TURNING IN THE AIR.
The Assassin looks over his shoulder as...BOOOM£ The BMW
crashlandss EXPLODING into chunks of churning, burning metal.

BAN!!! THE EXPLORER is attaCking. AUTOMATIC CHATTER BLASTINGE

Instantly, Jane stomps on the brake and swerves left before
swerving right and SIDESWIPING the Explorer. But the EXPLORER
HOLDS STRONG. Built for off—reading.

A Killer reaches out toward the minivan and OPENS the sliding
side door of the van.

JANE (CONT‘D)
We got more company John! Incoming!

John moves fast, as the Killer JUMPS from his car into the
back of the minivan. John simply pushes open the opposite
door and SHOVES him straight THROUGH the van, out the other
side. He FALLS off an overhang. FIFTY FEET! SPLAT.

JOHN
And...outgoing. God, these doors
are henérl

The Killer left in the Explorer RAMS them. Jane RAMS back.
John is knocked off his feet and nearly falls out.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Whoa there ned.

Jane smashes into the attacker, RIPPING her steel bumper into
the Explorer, destroying the entire side of the SUV.

JANE
Eat bull bars bitch.

John hangs onto the floor of the van for dear life. Road
rushes past both open rear doors. The Explorer Killer FIRES
full breach at John.

JOHN
Danger. I’m in danger here.

Jane starts to RAM again. The Explorer swings toward the van.
But Jane SLAMS HER BRAKES! A signature move. And the Explorer
SWERVES straight PAST the minivan, into the divide.

 

The Agent slams his brakes, but WHAME SMASHES INTO A CONCRETE
STANCHION. EXPLODING into flames. Jane drives past him.

John and Jane drive off into the horizon. In a beat~up
minivan. Bing Crosby's song comes to a resounding climax.

JOHN (CONT'D)
We have got to get one of these.

As they drive away from the FLAMING WRECKAGE, we FADE OUT.
A heat of SILENCE. Darkness. Peace. And FADE IN:

EXT. HIGHWAX — DAWN

The shoulder. We hear a plaintive SQUEAK. The sound of metal
on concrete. And...the MINIVAN rolls into frame. Tires
shredded. Rims destroyed. Just beat to shit.

The minivan slows to a stop. Dead. Bing Crosby fades out.

INI. MINIVAN — DAWN

John and Jane sit in silence. The quiet after the storm.
They stare into the distance.

The sun rises over the road ahead, leading to wilderness,
suburbs. Behind them, the city skyline looms large.

John and Jane sit, with cars whooshing past. Awkward, silent.
John slowly looks at Jane. He puts his toe in the water:

JOHN
You were pretty good. Back at the
house.

Jane is a little defensive. Holding tight.

JANE
What did you expect?

John shrugs.

JANE

"Pretty good.” Yeah... Where are
you going with this, John?

He shrugs. Not ready to dive in.

JOHN
I mean, they’re after both of us.
And you know, strength in numbers.

She slowly turns to him. Eyebrow cocked slightly. She needs
him to say it. He swallows.

JOHN (CONT'D)
We just try it... You know.

She looks out the window, considering. John watches her.

JANE

For now.
John plays it cool.

JANE
Yeah, see how it goes.

A beat. John and Jane look out their windows. And...
The trial begins.

Jane looks from.customer to customer. Paranoid. She knows the
next attack could come from anywhere.

John site still, trying not to say the one thing he wants to
say. Finally, he cracks:

JOHN
So how many?

JANE
John, please.

JOHN
I just want to know—

JANE
We're on the run from countless
aesaseins right now. It’s really
not the best timem

JOHN
Just give a number. Then I won’t
ask anything else, I promise. How
many? How many before me?

Jane looks away. Checking the crowd. All suSpicious. The Lady
with the Christmas sweater? The Old Man with the cane?

JOHN (CONT'D)
How about if I go first?

Jane knows this ie the only way to move on.

JANE
Fine. Go ahead.

JOHN
I don't exactly keep count. But I’d

bystanders in that?
Jane shakes her head, annoyed. And we CUT To:

John and Jane stride across the lot. Jane is ten yards ahead.
JOHN

Cold, professional. Got it.

JANE
We need a plan.

John slowly looks at her. His eyes are dark, hopeless.

JOHN
A plan? We'll let's see. We've got
countless gOVernment assassins
hunting us down. We got no house,
no job, no office. And my wife has
killed enough people to fill a
small village. You want to hear my
plan? We go to Coney Island, ride
the Cyclone, and call our parents
to say goodbye.

JANE
My parents are dead.
JOHN
What?
JANE

They died when I was ten.
This news hits John harder than everything else combined.
JOHN

So who Was the kindly fellow giving
you away at the wedding?

, JANE
He was a paid actor.

John sits rocked.
JOHN
I feel so naive. I feel so naive
for bringing my real parents to the
wedding.

John looks at Jane, realizing how little he knows. This is
the single lowest moment of his life. He croaks:

JOHN (CONT'D)
I said, I said I saw your dad on
"Fantasy Island.”

Jane in trying to stay professional here.

JANE
Sorry.

They drive a beat in silence. No eye Contact. And then:

JANE (CONT‘D)
All we need is something to trade
for our lives. Something the boss
wants more than he wants us.

John keeps his eyes out the window. Distant.

JOHN
Where we gonna find that kind of

saying. It sends a mixed message.

JANE
Trust me, I don’t need to

good job of that, all on your own.

John tightens. He holds out his gun. Think you can do better?

JOHN
Nice. Go ahead.

John can't help but smile. She looks at Hector. Her eyes

Hector swallows hard. He’s struggling to hold tight. John is
struggling too. He grips his gun tighter.

Jane's hand is on his shoulder, rubbing softly.

Hector is sweating. Jane is so close he can taste her.

JANE
Hector Danz.

She lights up. A drag.

JANE (CONT’D)
His name's Hector Danz. He was an
accountant for the CIA. Ran all the
booke for freelance hitters. They

on domestic targets.

Another drag. John just stares at her.

JANE (CONT‘D)
FBI was onto the operation. They

Horner. And he's got access to the
top fifty hitters in the United
States. Who are all after ﬁg now.

I’m not talking about your job. I'm
talking about you. And you always
blow go what you can't fix.

John roils, emotional.

JOHN
Where is this coming from?

JANE
where is this coming from? How
about the fact that you fired a
ballistic missile at mei You shot
up our wagonl You tried to run me
over with a monster trucké
{a beat, real)
All you do is wreck things.

JOHN
And you think you're so much
better? Your neat little boxes.
Everything tagged and filed. What
happened to my car?2

JANE
You ran it into the river. while
trying to attack me.

JOHN
Egg slipped out of the house. Not
me. That's you. Always avoiding
things.

JANE
John. I didn't blow up the one
thing that could save us.

JOHN
Jane. It wasn't my idea to get
Hector.

JANE

So this is my fault?! This is my
fault now?

. JOHN

(snapping)
No. it's my fault. It's all my
fault. It's my fault we met. It’s
my fault we moved in. And it's
definitely my fault we got married.

Fuck. Right away, he wishes he could take the last sentence
back. But it’s too late. It’s out there. Jane hardens.

JANE
No, John. That was both our faults.

 

A hard beat. 0n the edge of the dark highway. John stands
frustrated. He wants to stop the bleeding.

JOHN
Look. Husbands and wives lie to
each other all the time. It doesn’t
mean they don’t know each other.

JANE
Doesn't it?

A beat. A challenge:
JANE (CONT‘D)

So tell me one thing that's true.
One thing you really mean...

(CONTINUED)

lll.
CONTINUED: (5)

She needs something meaningful here. John opens his mouth.
But nothing comes out. He doesn’t know what to say. Jane

shakes her head, disappointed.

JANE (CONT'D)
You were right... I don't know you
at all.

She turns around. A beat. Miles away. John searches. Finds:

JOHN
I'm sorry...

Hold on John. And we CUT TO——
INT. ANONYMOUS ROOM
A phone rings. A hand picks up.

VOICE
Identify.

JANE (ON PHONE)
3146578.

VOICE
Your contract has been rescinded.

JANE (ON PHONE)
I have a package for the Boss.
Something he wants.

VOICE
(a beat)
Where would you like to make
delivery?
JANE
Somewhere public, covered, no clean
shots.
VOICE (ON PHONE)
Name it.

EXT. MOTEL — PAYPHONE ON HIGHWAY — NIGHT

Jane hangs up. No sign of John. She looks at the horizon. The
sun rises, blood red. A.cold wind bIOWS. Jane drops her
cigarette, and stomps it out. Hard.

And we CUT TO... AN EPIC SWEEPING AERIAL SHOT OF.......

 

 

 

112.

EXT. IKEA SUPERSTORE - DAY

See the Christmas shoppers. Smell the new saint. And enterwe
INT. IKEA SUPERSTORE. DAY.

John enters ALONE. His eyes shift from customer to customer.

Potential assassins everywhere. That guy over there looking
at the bunkbeds. The couple paying for garden furniture.

 

John walks slow. Wary. Eyes shifting. Hands running through
soft furnishings. And then...

VOICE (0.3.)
Mr. Smith.

John turns to face MR. BURNER: a very ordinary man carrying a
very ordinary basket of goods. He smiles broadly. Terrifying.

JOHN
Mr. Horner.

His smile tightens, realizing John knows his name. John‘s
eyes keep moving, checking the customers, sightlines.

MR. HORNER
Looking for your wife?

A hanging beat.

MR. HORNER {CONT'D)
She tell you she'd take the back
route? Meet you in the middle?

John stays quiet. He looks at Mr. Horner. That scary smile.

MR. BURNER (CONT'D)
I don‘t think she'll be joining us.
Except to pick up her payment.

JOHN
What are you talking about?

MR. HORNER
We always knew she was the better
hitter. Of course, it took her a
little longer than usual to clean
the scene this time. But at least
she finished what she started.

John looks gutpunched. His eyes scanning. He sees the store
filled with suspicious moves, bulges. Quiet:

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 

113.
CONTINUED:

JOHN
Looks like the gang's all here.

Mr. Horner smiles, nods good-naturedly.

MR. BURNER
You know, I had a wife once...

He trails off. We can only imagine what happened to his wife.
JOHN
How much? How much did she get for
serving me up?

Mr. Horner pats a BAG in his basket.

MR. HORNER
Class one contract, John.

John shakes his head, digesting. Horne: gives a cruel smile.
MR. HORNER (CGNT'D)
Don't tell me you thought this
would all have a happy ending...?

John looks up. Intense. Remembering Jane’s words:

JOHN
Happy endings...are just stories...

VOICE (0.8.)
That haven’t finished yet.

And we see...JANE steps out from behind Mr. Horner. He turns,
a little surprised to see her. John’s eyes remain level,
giving away no emotion, nothing.

JOHN
Perfect timing, Jane.

JANE
Perfect as always.

CUT TO:
MAN IN MOCK BATHROOM
The Man sits on mock toilet. Speaks into a wrist mic.

MAN ON TOILET
Status cheek.

CGNTINUED:

CUT TO:
MAN PUSHING PRAM

MAN PUSHING PRAM
Stay in position, on my mark.

BACK To:
Mr. Harmer keeps his eyes on Jane.

MR. HORNER
You here to collect early?

He motions to the bag. she takes it.

JANE
Yes. I am.

She opens the bag, checking the cash.

MR. HORNBR
Any last words, John?

John keeps his eyes on Jane. A flicker of...connection...?

JOHN
In light of the seriousness of the
situation, and since I may not have
the chance later, I want you to
know I married you because I loved
you.

Jane looks at John.

JANE
Likewise. I wanted what I wanted
and I lied. I apologize.

Mr. Horner looks slightly confused. Hie smile creases.

JOHN
Me too. Alec, you‘re the only girl
I ever loved. Nobody made me feel
the way you did, before all the
whatnot got in the way.

JANE
Ditto. Guy with the trolley?

Okay, now Mr. Harmer is seriously confused. What the fuck is
going on? He looks back and forth between John and Jane.

( CONTINUED )

 

 

 

115.
CONTINUED: (2)

JOHN

Got him. Couple by the lamps?
JANE

Check.
JOHN

So. You ready?

And...Jane steps BESIDE JOHN. Facing Mr. Earner together.

 

JANE
Yeah. I'm ready.

Mr. Horner’s smile finally fades. Dead serious.

MR. HORNER
If this is some kind of plan, it
can't possibly work.

JOHN
No, it's not a plan. See, we tried
to come up with a clever plan. But
we couldn't agree on anything.

JANE
We had a few ideas, but they never
really gelled into anything.

There is something different about their bickering now. A
rhythm. As if they are in on the same joke. Their eyes keep
moving, casing. The customers slowly shift positions.

JOHN
(buying time)
I thought maybe we should all meet
at the Wollmen Memorial.

MR. HORNER
What are you talking about?

 

JANE
The ice rink in Central Park. From
all the movies.

JOHN
But turns out Jane can’t skate.
(to Jane)
Guy on the forklift.

Jane sees the forklift. She continues. Eyes moving. Riffing:

JANE
Then John wanted to meet and stage
our deaths in front of the Statue
of Liberty.
(to John)
Shooter on the shelves.

JOHN
But Jane said you’d probably kill
us soon as we got there.

JANE
And it is the ending of The Sting.

Mr. Horner loses patience:

MR. HORNER
SHUT UP.

 

John and Jane look at Mr. Horner. He gathers himself.

MR. HORNER (CONT'D)
Do you have any idea how many times
you're outnumbered here?

JOHN
Well see, we didn't before. But we
do now.

MR. HDRNER

so you know for a fact you’re not
walking out of here alive.

JOHN
That's more than possible. Wouldn‘t
you say, honey?

JANE
More than possible. I’d say
"likely”.

FATHER
I don't understand. What on earth
made you think it would work?

They look at each other. Shrug.

JOHN
This is us, you know. This is what
we do.

The Truth. They look back.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 

117.
CONTINUED: {4)

JANE
Plus, we have very, very big balls.

Without turning.

JOHN
See you in the next life Jane.

JANE
Likewise John.

Jane pulls a gun and time turns to syrup. John throws the bag
into the air, covering Jane’s head. She FIRES at the BAG, so
money explodes into the air, buying them precious cover.

A TELESCGPIC SIGHT SHOT is obscured by the cloud of bills.
Mr. Horner steps away, disappearing down the aisle.

A fully armed TEAM sit up in the KIDDIE FOAM BALL PIT where
they had been hiding. They OPEN FIRE on Jane and John.

Jane aims at a man drawing his gun and blows him backwards
off his feet. The MAN ON THE TOILET get off one shot at them
before John takes him out. John and Jane SMASH through the
paint cans, into the massive shelving unit.

They roll GRENADES across the floor spewing colored smoke.
Another grenade spins further out. As Killers swarm the area,
the grenade goes off with a flash, BANG! A percussion
grenade. It takes out the four nearest guys.

John and Jane, now inside the shelving unit, crouch—run
behind the paint cans as shots rain in, SPATTERING them with
multi—oolored PAINTS. They roll out into the opposite aisle.

John skids across the floor on his back, FIRING continuously,
DROPPING two agents with rifles. Jane covers the other angle
FIRING at multiple targets pouring into her end of the aisle.

The aisles are working in their favor, they only have two
directions to cover. Baokmto-back, they BLAST their way
through a chipboard wardrobe into another shelving unit where
they fluidly reload under cover as they spin into the next
aisle. Swapping directions, they cover opposite angles.

Agents pour into each end of the aisle but they have no
cover. Jane and John Work through them methodically, soewing
hot lead, raining brass casings. More and more Agents appear.

But Jane and John have found an unstoppable RHYTHM. Like Fred
and Ginger.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

118.
CONTINUED: (5)

Covering each other, reloading under shelves, crossihg into
aisle after aisle, covering each other again and again.

The Agents quickly realize they are at a disadvantage on this
terrain. They hang back, FIRING more carefully. John and Jane
have to be more careful now, more observant. Reacting to the

smallest movements. They burst out of the warehouse area and

into the SHOWROOM .

Eerily, John and Jane move through living room mock ups,
kitchens, stalking through studies and immaculate bedrooms.
Like a HAZE, they encounter Agents round corners, firing at
John and Jane from hidden vantage points.

Two Agents are dug into a BATHROOM, laying down fire. The
cover is more readily available here, the ground broken. John
and Jane’s progress is slowed in a mocknup of the ideal
suburban LIVING ROOM. They continue to shoot it out.

JANE (CONT’D)
Ammo?

JOHN
Low. Can’t get stuck here. We need
to reinforce.

Two Agents incoming. Jane gets low, grabbing CHRISTMAS
LIGHTS off a pillar, whipping out the lights, SWEEPING the
Agents to their feet. As they fall, she snatches their guns.
She tosses the reinforcements to John. On the move...

JANE
The other side of that wall,
through soft furnishings and we're
home free.

John looks at his wife, fucking impressed. They jump up and
lay down a withering FIRE on the bathroom, which gets blown
to bits. One agent ICED, the other dives into the BATHTUB.

John and Jane run through the final few rooms and into SOFT
FURNISHINGS. It seems quiet. Too quiet. Suddenly a SHOT hits
John in the leg and he goes down. Jane drops with him.

They hit the deck and start CRAWLING through acres of beds in
rows. Jane pops up and takes out the shooter through a
venetian blind. She looks to John. "You okay?"

John node and they’re off, crawling under beds hopping up now
and again to look around.

TWELVE AGENTS run into the section. They split up and stalk
through the beds.

(CONTINUED)

 

119.
CONTINUED: (6)

Suddenly John pops up and takes one out. Just as they react.
Jane pops up on the other side twenty feet away and drops
another. They attempt to react to Jane, but John pops up,
twenty feet further on and HITS again. It’s impossible to
tell where John and Jane are. The remaining agents hit the
deck, adopting the Smiths' technique and...

A name of deadly hide—and-seek ensues in the WORLD'S LARGEST
EEDEQQﬂ-

More Agents spill into the room. No one seems to be able to
locate where or when the Smiths will pep up next. John and
Jane separate. They shoot and fight their way toward the
door. Taking guns off fallen enemies for ammo. Their progress
seems inexorable. A bloodbath. .

Then... Silence. Panting, they both listen. No sounds of
life. They are the only two people left in the world.

John and Jane slowly stand up and walk out. John leans on
Jane for support. As they pass Mr. Horner, without looking:

’ ' JANE (CONT'D)
We're the only game left in town.

JOHN
You know where to find us.

EXT. IKEA — DAY

In slow motion: John and Jane, both streaked with blood and
colored paint, walk out of IKEA, weapons still drawn. They
pass SHOPPERS cowering behind cars. Kids cry. People pray.

A WOMAN runs out in front of them trying to get to her car.
John lazily raises his gun but Jane touches his arm. It's OK.
She's real. He lowers it. A nuclear FAMILY are on their
faces behind their Range Rover.

John and Jane get in their car and slowly drive away. As they
head into the hills, we hear the swell of SIRENS. And...

A convoy of CARS speeds toward IKEA. We recognize the FBI
sedans. And...

INT. IKEA SUEERSTORE - DAY
CRUNCH! FBI AGENTS in flak~jackets swarm the store. Guns out.
Familiar faces. They see the FORTY KILLERS layed out. with

Christmas wreathes and blinking lights strewn everywhere, the
bodies almost look like...Christmas presents.

John and Jane drive away. Jane at the wheel. She reaches
over, and puts her hand on John's hand. Blood mingling.

DR. WEXLER (V.O.)
So I’m pleased to see you back here
as a couple...

INT. DOCTOR WEXLER'S OFFICE e DAY
John and Jane sit next to each other on the love seat.

DR. WEXLER
I’m interested to hear what
progress you feel you've made, it
any, over the past two weeks or so.

JOHN
Well, I think we made a little
progress, don't you honey?

JANE
I'd say 50..

JOHN
I can't speak for Jane but I feel
we've got to know each other all
over again, our good points, our
bad points...

JANE
Our really bad points..

JOHN
Right. I mean it’s early but I’d
say we've brought a whole new level
of honesty to our relationship.

JANE
We realized we were depriving each
other of who we really were.

JOHN
I feel free for the first time
since we met. I feel like
there's...there’s...

(CONTINUED)

JANE
...room for us to grow, to become
more like us rather than shrinking
into some idea of who we should be.

DR. WEXLER.
You know, a lot of couples I meet,
the biggest block is trust.

JANE
You know that is go true.

DR. WEXLER.
It seems you’ve refound the trust
in your love. John, Jane, I'm
pleased for you. What you’ve
discovered is very special. 30 on a
scale of one to ten how happy would
you say you are now?

They smile at Dr. Wexler.

JANE
Eight.

JOHN
Nine.

They look each at each other. SNAP To BLACK.
REALLY LOUD DEATH METAL.

FADE OUT.
