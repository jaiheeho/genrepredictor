AERIAL SHOT ---THE GULF. OF HEXICO.- NIGHT

The full moon glitters on the water far below,
highlighting oil rigs, tankers, shrimpers, etc. studding
the vast expanse. '

We hear a RADIO 0.3.

DJ (0.5.)
It's two ayem on Crescent City
Radio, wwoz, and we're stirrin'
up the gumbo....

BEGIN MUSIC 54 BEAUSOLEIL: "ZYDECO GRIS-GBIS”

An uptempo-Cajun stomp that sets the syncopated beat of
the coming sequence._

BEGIN rm: sequence
IN A seams or sac-rs

CAMERA sweeps down over the- mouth of the Mississippi, and
up the river, getting lower and closer. The lights of
New Orleans twinkle in the distance.

Now we are on the river, moving upstream, under the
Greater New Orleans Bridge, past huge container ships
from all over the world, docked along an endless line of
warehouses.

Now we are moving toward.the river bank. A light blinks
twice on shore.

We are closing in on a.huge, dark warehouse. A man,
FREDDIE ANGELO, 37, a sharply-dressed hard guy, waits in
the shadows at. the end of the dock; waves a greeting with
his flashlight as we close in en him.

END TITLE SEQUENCE

Suddenly, Freddie hears a. NOISE; whirls, looks up.
CAMERA pans up to reveal

TWO FIGURES framed in the warehouse doorway. They are
wearing large, papier-mache Hardi Gras head-masks. They
OPEN FIRE with silenced HAC 10 machine pistols.

FREDDIE goes down in a spray of bullets.

The Figures turn and FIRE two more BURSTS straight at
CAMERA. .

MUSIC CONTINUED OVER
CUT TO:

EXT. POYDRAS STREET - NIGHT

HARCELLINE ARDOIN, a soulful black nurse is hopping down
the street to the same music on her Ralkman. A toy
poodle pulls her by the leash into the shadow of an
archway. She- turns at the SQUEAL OF BRAKES nearby.

HARCELLINE’S’POV - THE STREET

A chromeless late-model Ford pulls up to the curb. Two
Figures pull a THIRD FIGURE out of the back seat and
stagger drunkenly into the Piazza D'Italia, leaving the
car~doors'open.

HARCELLINE tugs the leash, dragging the poodle down the
street past the Ford." She glances inside the car,
pauses, noticing something we can‘t. see, glances back
toward the Figures in the piazza. The poodle WHIMPERS,
-tries to jump into the car. Harcelline pulls the dog
away, boogie-ing on to the- music in her head, then
disappearing into the shadows of some fake-Roman statuary
that borders the piazza.

Two Figures run out of the piazza, jump into the Ford,
PEEL OUT. .

Marcelline turns-the corner, past.the office of the-WNew
Orleans Italian—American Society". The poodle is tugging
at the leash. Harcelline stoops,-unhooks the leash, and
the little poodle makes a bee-line for the fountain in
the center of the piazza.

OVERHEAD ANGLE - PIAZZA D'ITALIA - NIGHT

Freddie's body lies sprawled, half-in-half—out of the-
illuminated, Italy-shaped pool. The square is deserted.

IN A SERIES OF CUTS, we SEE two SQUAD CARS arrive,
ONLOOKBRS gather, an AMBULANCE pull up, a FORENSIC UNIT,
PHOTOGRAPHERS taking pictures of the body and the scene,
hunting for clues, COPS setting up barricades, etc., etc.
Finally, a beautifully waxed Chrysler LeBaron convertible
pulls in through the fake-Roman arch.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The- LeBarcn, radio blasting out WWOZ backbeat, turns into>
the square.

. PATROLMAN'
Closed, pal.
(then)
Oh, sorry, Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT REMY McSWAIN gets out of the convertible and
walks toward the crime scene. Remy is a marked contrast
-to the other detectives on the scene with their beer
bellies and sloppy suits; Remy is trim, very fit,
carefully-barbered and -- even at.this hour -- very
expensively_dressed. Eels a dude.

KELLOM“
Remy! Over here.

A uniformed Police Captain, JACK KELLOM, waves Remy over
to the body. He's big, beefy, jolly; sports a big red
nose.” He has a.doting, paternal tone with Remy.

KELLOM
Where you coming from? Don‘t
you ever Sleep?

' REMY
(grins)

Only when the music. stops, cher.
(walking over to the
body). _

What.do we have here?

KELLOM
You make him?

REMT
Sure. Freddie-Angelo, a.wise'
guy.. Works for "The Cannon". _
Handles Mexican imports for the
Family. .

KELLOM
Ah, Remy, you've a good eye for the
cops. To me they all look alike. .

Detective McCabe leaves off examining the masonry of the
Piazza with a flashlight and comes over to the Captain.
She-' s a short-haired, tom—boyish redhead, 20' s. In the
man' 5 world of the Homicide Bureau she holds her own with
the boys. She greets Remy with a punch on the arm. '

MCCABE
Can't find any bullet hits. spent
shells, nothing like.that. Very
little blood. We figure they smoked
him someplace else, then brought his
body here. He had twelve hundred
cash in his money clip and a Piaget
watch, all untouched.

REM?
(impressed)-
Piaget?

McCABE
Here's:the walletr they just got
through lifting the prints.

REM! , ,
The-driver's license is missing.

MCCABE
I figure the killer took it for
proof of the hit. Standard wise-
guy procedure, right, Remy?

REM!
Standard if they were gonna wrap
him in.a concrete overcoat and
drop him in Lake Pontchartrain.
But here's Freddie in all his glory,
right in the middle of the Piazza
D'Italia. What-does that tell us?

McCabe shrugs.

REMY
(looking-around)
Given the surroundings, Ild say it
was a message to the esteemed
president of the Italian-American
Association. .

McCAEE
Vinnie "The Cannon"Di Moti

IRemy pinches McCabels cheek.
REMY

Bring Mr. Di Moti in for questioning
first thing tomorrow. ‘

McCABE

(gulps)
Suppose he won't come!

_ REM?
' Arrest him as a material witness.
You'll find him at the barber shop.
He's always there around ten.

Captain Kellom puts his arm on Remy’s shoulder and pulls
him away from the others.

'KELLOM
Forget the Cannon: your father
never got him. I never got him,
and your're never gonna get him.

. REM? '
Gotta keep trying cher. Itis like
a family tradition.

It's her office. She's a lawyer, 27. There's a great

ON A CARTOON CUT-OUT_hanging on a wall: a grinning
vulture. As the shot-RIDERS, we see the vulture's
perched on a blow-up of the brass, crescent-shaped
shield of the New Orleans Police Department. As
camera WIDENS FURTHER we see that the whole thing
is hanging over the doorway of the Homicide Squad.
Remy enters through the open doorway, dressed in

a very well-cut business suit.

There are about a dozen desks occupied by DETECTIVES.
In the back are two glassed-in offices, one.small,
one large. Anne sits waiting in the small office -
Remy's. ~

In the larger office Captain Kellom is bowling out
ED DODGE and ANDRE DE SOTO. They are both about
Remy's age -came.out of:the-Police Academy together,
but neither has fared as well as Remy. De Soto has
eaten himself into a mountain. Dodge is thin, always
needs a shave, and wears a cheap toupee. '

As soon as Kellom spots Remy, he bursts out into the
squad room, leaving Dodge and De Soto standing there,
hangdog.
REM!
I What'd they do now?

KELLOM
(exasperated)

Impounded a boat...spent half
their shift down at the goddam
Police Dock! What am I gonna
do with these guys?

;' REMY
Why don‘t we shoot em?
' KELLOM
Nah, they're fun to have around
for Mardi Gras.

Dodge.and De Soto brighten up, saunter out into the
squad room. Remy notices Anne sittingIby his desk.

Ram's P.0.V.-ANNEZ

' REM?
Who‘s that in my office?

KELLOM
That's Anne Osborne. She‘s an
Assistant’D.A.

REM!
I've heard about her. She's with
the strike force investigating
corruption.

KELLOM‘
Yeah, but she‘s here about the
Angelo murder. We got written '
orders to co-operate. Make nice.

REM!
(grins)
She’s in good hands, cher.

INT. REMY‘S”OFFIGE-DAY

Remy enters, all.smiles, sticks out his hand to Anne
Osborne, perches on the corner of his desk, hovering
over her, turning on the charm.I ‘

REM!

ANNE-
Eow do you do, Lieutenant. IFve...

Lieutenant. I'm here to find out
what progress you've made on the
Angelo murder. - V

REMY
(big smile) .
Whatfs your hurry? The guy‘s not
even stiff yet;

ANNE
(sardonic)
He is dead, though, isn't he?

REMY
Last time I saw him.

ANNE '
Is that it?‘ No clues, leads?

REMY

(grins)
Not.so far. Lock, I’ve seen dozens of
these wise-guy jobs. We usually find
out why the hit went down; sometimes we
find.out.who did.it; we even make an
arrest once in a while, but we never
have enough to take to court.

Anne who has been writing furiously on her legal pad,
suddenly breaks the point.o£ her pencil. »As-Remy
deftly hands he: a new one.from his desk top, McCabe
taps on Remy's office door and.opens it;

McCABE;
He wasn 't. at the barber shop, so
we had. to go pick him. up at his
house. .

REMY
Bring.him in.

Remy rises as Vincent "The Cannon” Di Moti enters.

he wears a dark pin-striped suit: his cane is in

You know, .Preddie Angelo, the

THE CANNON
You know, kid, your father
would never have dragged me
down here like this. He
knew a little_scmething about
respect. Can I go now?

The Cannon strides out of the office,
McCabe. Anne turns to Remy, steaming.

~ ANNE. .
I can't believe you were so
obsequious with that man.

REMY
What.does obsequious mean?

ANNE
It means you had a high ranking
member of the Mafia in your
office-and you kissed his ass.‘

REMY .
Well, first of.all, nobody uses
word "mafia” anymore. Down here,
we call.‘em "wisezguys". I only—
mention this to save.you
embarrassment-

ANNE
Iill bear that in mind-..
Anything‘else?

REM!
Actually, I learned.a lot from

.that*little.interview.

. ANNE
Oh yeah? You read Tarot cards?

REM!

(laughs) .
I'read.people. For instance,
after seeing The Cannon, I
can probably tell you why Freddie
sprung a leak last night. Hey,
you like spicy food? Why don't
we have dinner tonight? I know
a'place...

A beat.

ANNE
Just tell me what you found
out from two minutes of ass-
kissing.

Remy is beginning to realize that Ms. Osborne

is quite capable of holding her own.

REM?
Freddie-Angelo was one of the
Cannon's top men, see? Killing
him and dumping him in the Piazza
d’Itaila--that was a message to
Vinnie.

ANNE
And the message was...?

REMY
I think somebody' s telling him
it.'s time to retire. Last time‘
I saw him he didn't have a hearing
aid or a cane, either. He's

' gotton old. Some of his people

may be.getting restless,

ANNE
This all sounds pretty flimsy
to me.

REMY

There's more. Normally, he goes .
to his barber every morning_for

a shave. and a manicure. Today,
he stayed home.

ANNE

'Meaning what?

REMY‘ .
Meaning the message.is coming
through loud and;clear;

ANNE
I.suppose you-know who the
killer is, too?

REMY
No, but in a week or so, I bet

"we find his body.

ANNE
Then what.will you do?

REM?
Nothing. We'll never get
anything we can take to court.
Hell, I'd close.the case right
now except for-one thing.

ANNE
What's-that?

m
I'll.tell you over dinner.
ANNE

EXT; K-PAULFs.- NIGHT . “

Remy's LeBaron pulls up to a fire hydrant in front of
this funky, but world-famous restaurant.. Remy flips
down his sun.visor so that it shows an official placard:
"Police Business2"‘ Anne notes this,disapprovingly.

There is=a line of people half a block long waiting

_ outside the door which is guarded.by a uniformed copt
MAURICE. He opens the-door as Remy and Anne approach.
The crowd.whistles as they are ushered insider

ANNE .
This is.embarrassing.

REMY
Nah, this is what's great about
being a cop. ‘ '

INT. K-PAUL'S - NIGHT

The joint is jammed and jumping, crowded with people
tables packed around a small dance floor where Little
Queenie and the Radiators crank out the quintessential
New-Orleans ”Second.Line" backbeat. The din is so
loud you have to shout to be heard.

The bar is absolutely packed, people standing three deep.
Perched.on a stool strategically placed between the
cash.register and the kitchen door sits the gargantuan
black-bearded Patron, CHEF PAUL, taking little taste
from the overflowing plates the waiter carry. out. He
waves to Remy holding up five fingers.

REM?
(to Anne)
It'll be five minutes...

Anne looks around agog at all this activity- The
music is-infectious, starting her foot to tapping.
Remy notices.

REMY
Dance with me...We'll  work up an
appetite.

ANNE

.I thought we were here to
discuss business?

REMY
Not at the bar...Never know who
might be listening...

Anne smiles as-Remy leads her out onto-a dance floor
filled.with bouncing} sweaty people.

Anne is a little intimidated,,having a hard time
picking up the idiosyncratic beat.

REMY
Didn' t they dance where you
come from?
They didnft dance at all.

Remy leads her, into-it, showing her the steps.

REMY
Well, this is New Orleans, Cher.
Down here, dancing is. a way of l.ife.

Anne does her best to pick up the beat as we...

The-dancing is over, the room has cleared out a bit.
Anne and Remy are seated at a table in the back,
picking over the remains of a sumptous meal crawfish
etouffee, file' gumbo, blackened redfish. Anne is a
little bit disheveled tipsy, sweating and flushed

from the spicy food, laughing at Remy' s put-on Cajan
accent.

REM!
My people-on my Nana’s side, dey

Very briefly.

Would.you like.me to tell you why
I’m not closing the Angelo case.

ANNE

Remy touching her) _
That's-supposed to be why I‘m here.

REMY

Suddenly'Remy is very much a-oop.

How come an assistant District

suddenly interested in a routine
Mafia hit?

"Wise-guy". A.routine wise guy hit.

What.gives?
ANNE.
(business-like)

Our office has jurisdiction to
investigate any crime we see fit.

Is there some police corruption
angle on this case?

Not for the first time-Anne realizes that she's
underestimated Remy.

ANNE
No comment.

EXT. TCHOUEITOULAS ST.-NIGHT

Remy' s LeBaron turns a corner and finds the street
blocked by a group of TRANSVESTITES, staging an
impromptu "Southern. Decadence-" _parade.

INT} REMX'S'LEBARDN-SAME

_A- portable blue police light sits in the well between
Anne's and Remy' 5- seats, along with a two-way radio
and. a box of shotgun shells. Remy takes the light,
puts in on the dashboard, flicks it on. The flashing
blue light disperses the Transvestites. Remy steers
the LeBaron through them. Anne looks disapprovingly
at the array of.police-paraphernalia.

. ANNE'
' Does- the police department
outfit all of the detectives'
private cars like- this?.

REMY
It‘s a ”spook car”... confiscated
in a drug bust-.. makes for good
cover;

ANNE
Nice jobe-free car, free-food...

You honestly don't.5ee the harm
in-any of this?

REMY
No,-Iidon't see the harm-..
these=are.the.perks.

ANNE
But the restaurant is going to
expect extra protection in
return, and expect-the.officer.
to overlook any code violations.

REMY
If all the codes were enforced
you wouldn' t.have a restaurant in
this city that could stay open..

ANNE
So what you're doing here is
defending corruption.

- REMY
I'm not defending anything. This
is New Orleans, darling. Folks
have-a.certain way of doing things
down here. People like to show
their gratitude.

Anne snorts, offended'by his.smugness-

ANNEi . .
So how does it work? You.get free
suits? An envelope from Chef Paul
every week?

'Remy pulls up to a red light, gives her an amused,
incredulous look. He plucks open the lapel .of her
blouse, looks down.

REM!
You got a wire in there?

She. smacks his hand. away. Remy looks down the street,
then drives Straight thrOugh the red light. Anne
rolls her eyes.

. ANNEZ‘
I' m serious, you know. How far
does this stuff to? Is everything
for. Sale? What does it cost to
beat a murder rap?

REM?
(genuinely insulted)
Is that what you think about
cops? You got a real bad
attitude, lady...

ANNE
This evening hasn't done much to
improve it.any. I've never see
one person break so may laws in so
short-a.space of time.

REM! I
Forget about the law for just a
minute. When you get out-on the
street it's very simple—~there
are the good guys and.the bad
guys...

parting shot. '

ANNE
Don't think that I'm naive.
I know the way the system
works. But things can change.

‘ 'REMY
Yeah? You gonna change 'em?

She turns, starts away. Remy hops out of the car.

REMY
Is this your building?

ANNE
No, I live up the street- I.just

REMY
II'll wait and drive you
the rest of the way.

Hen Pantry.

EXT. ANNEFS STREET --NIGHT.--LITTLE LATER ”

Anne is walking up her street burdened by two plastic
shopping bags in addition to her briefcase. Suddenly,
behind her, a woman SCREAMS:

I

WOMAN(O. S.)

My-pursel

Anne turns.around to see a MUGGER running toward her,
clutching a woman's purse. Instinctively Anne swings

one of her shopping bags at.the mugger‘s legs, and the
' muggerItakes a nosedive into the pavement.' But Anne
doesn't see...

THE SECOND MEGGER who plows;into her, and she-smashes

into the pavement with. a sickening crunch. The wind's

-been. knocked out of her but. still she- grabs the Second
Mugger' s ankle. He tries to twist away but....

ANNE won' t let go even though. he' s dragging her along
the pavement, trying to kick. his foo.t out of her grip.

' But now the....

. FIRST MUGGER has gotten. up and has pulled a knife on
Anne, either. to threaten her or to stick her, but just
then....

REMY‘S LEBARON bounces up onto the sidewalk, knocks
the First Mugger flying. In a flash. Remy’s out Of
the car, gun down and shouting.

REM?
Police!

The Second Hugger tries to_dodge past and Remy slams
him on the side of the head with the pistol and he
sinks to his knees. Remy levels his gun right at the
First Mugger's face no more than four feet away.

REMY
(continuing)
Don‘t screw up!

The First Mugger drops the knife. Anne—e dazed-—
starts to get up, but Remy stops her.

- REM!
(Continuing)
.Stay down for a second.
(to First hugger)
Get down flat on your face.
Right.there. That‘s right.
(to-Second.Mugger)
You, too, face down on
the sidewalk there.

SECOND MUGGER
Me?

REMY
No, the Pope! Face down.

Very cautiously Remy frisks his prisoners, one at a
time, his gun covering them closely. He flings the
contents of their pockets out into the gutter.

Anne gets to her knees. Her dress is torn, her knee
is scraped. She crawls a couple of feet to one of
her shopping bags and is trying to put the contents
back in the bag.

REM!
(continuing; to Anne)
Just sit.there a minute. Good
thing I'm such a pushy guy, huh? _

A dumpy, 55-years old WOMAN, the victim of the mugging,
.runs up, gasping for breath. Remy picks up the woman' s
purse from the sidewalk and hands it to her.

WOMAN
You a- cop? Thank God you were
here., I just cashed my paycheck.

The Woman checks through her purse, then, satisfied that
the contents are intact, starts to hobble away. '

REMY
If you'll stay a moment, a
patrolman will.take your
statement.

ignores her. He handcuffs the prisoners together,
running the chain of the handcuffs through his LeBaron‘ s
bumper so the prisoners can 't get away.

Remy crouches close to the Muggers. and pitches his.
voice low, so that Anne cannot hear him.

He sees her shoulders shaking. She tries to wave him
away. She. s embarrassed by the wracking spasms that
shake her whole body.

Remy takes over, pulls open some cabinets, finds a
bottle of vodka and. pours- her a- stiff shot. He holds
it.for her, half forces her to drink it; she gags

on the warm liquor. Remy takes a stiff belt for
himself straight out.of the bottle.

REM?
Everything's.all right now.
You’re-safe. Nothing's
gonna bother you.

She blunders into his-arms, he holds her and rocks her
back and forth. Remy strokes her hair, kisses her _
cheek, then kisses her lightly on the lips. She steps
back form him, turns away.

Anne enters at a fast pace into the darkened
warehouse. Captain.KeIlom is puffing to keep up
with.her.

This is.where they keep some of
the floats for Mardi.Gras. Look
at this one over here. .Ain‘t it
beautiful?

But Anne isn't interested. She's barrelling her way .
toward the lit-up scene of‘the crime.

ANNE'S POV’-JTHE.CRIME SCENE

The usual Photographers and Forensic Technicians are
doing their work. Someone is crduched.over the body,
blocking it from our view. As he rises and turns,
-we see-that.it's.Remy. He grins.

ANNE
(to Kellom, outraged)
What is this man doing here?

KELLOM
(to McCabe)
What:is:this man doing here?

Before McCabe can answer, Remy comes up to them.

REM! .
More.to the point, what.are
you doing here?

KELLOM
Yes, what are you doing here?

ANNE
I got an anonymous phone call.

She brushes past.Remy to look at the body.
SHOCK CUT ° CARMINE TANDINCfS BODY

All charred and blackened. Thereyis'a gaping hole
in the chest-

MCCABE
(with glee) -
They ripped. the heart. right
out of his chest.

Anne starts to get dizzy. Remy catches her, tries.to
put his arms around her. She angrily shoves him away.
Pulls herself together.

ANNE
(to McCabe)
Why-would.they do a thing
like~that?

' ANNE
Daddy Mention? The black

And voodoo priest.

 

' ' MCCABE
Black magic. Gris-gris. That's
Daddy Mention's thing.

REMY ‘"'“
"The heart of your enemy makes
you strongf.

ANNE
So you're saying that Daddy
Mention killed Carmine Tandino.

(Remy-nods)

Supporting your theory that
Tandino killed Daddy Mention's
men inthe projects the.other
night? ' .

REM!
So what we got a nice little
gang war going here.

KELLOM
(noticing Anne's
skeptical look)
Doesn’t it satisfy you,
Ms. Osborne?
ANNE
Not*particularly.
(to Remy)

I‘ll see you in court tomorrow,
Mr. McSwain.

She turns on her heel.and stalks off. Remy throws an

arm.over Kellom's shoulder. McCabe punches Remy in the
am .-

CUT' TO:
INT. COURTROOM - DAY

The spectators, almost all Remy's family, watch as Anne
cross-examines Remy on the-witness stand.- Mama, prominent
in the front row, is sitting on the edge of her seat, her
face registering ever emotional shift as the drama unfolds.

' ANNE
You.have testified that you
went to the tavern to see an
informer.

v REM!
Yes-ma'am.

ANNE
If it is true that you were
engaged in your duties as‘a
policeman, why did you run
away from the Internal Affairs
Officer?

REMY
He did not identify himself

as a.cop. I thought he was
a mugger.

ANNE
were you armed?

REMY
Yes.

ANNE
And you ran away from a
mugger? -

REM!
I was trying to call for
assistance, which is proper
police-procedure-

Mama nods with approval, nudges Aunt Emmeline beside her.
They why did you-chew up and
swallow the envelope?

. REM?
That’s ridiculous. I did
no.such thing.

ANNY .
Then where is the envelope?
‘Rm
What envelope?
ANNE

The envelope that George Joel
gave to you. The envelope
that contained eight.fifty-
dollar bills - ' '

(interrupting)
Objection, Your Honor! Counsel

is-drawing conclusions --

ANNE
(continuing)
--the eight fifty-dollar bills
that you-threw into the air!
The envelope that you ate!

Mama-clutches her heart, stung by the vehemence of
Anne's anger.

LAMAR PARMENTEL
Objection!

Sustained! ‘

Anne suddenly shuts up. A murmur goes through the
courtroom.

ANNE _
No further questions, Your Honor.

. JUDGE NOLAND
Thank you, Mr. McSwain. You
may step down.

Remy steps down and returns to his.seat, never taking his
eyes off Anne. She won't.look at him. But finally, she
does. Mama, sees.this.

LAMAR‘PARMENTEL
Your Honor, the defense at this
time moves for dismissal-

The.spectators become silent: they know this is the key
moment-

ANNE
May Iibe heard on the motion,
Your Honor?

JUDGE NOLAND

- ANNE
Your Honor, the State has shown
that the defendant was present
at the place and time the crime
was committed and has presented
testimony by police officers.
linking the defendant to the
crime, in- addition to eyewitness
testimony.

MMAR PARMENTEL
By a convicted felon.

. ANNE
The credibility of the witness
is not.at issue in a preliminary
hearing -- that is-for a jury
to decide.

LAMAR PARMENTEL
May I be-heard, Your Honor?

JUDGE NOLAND
-Mr. Parmentel.

LAMAR PARMENTEL
.The State has failed to establish
any crime at all-. All that's
been proven is that.the defendant
was present in the Toulouse Bar 8
Grill which was open for. busine.ss
at the time.

. JUDGE NOLAND
It is the-ruling of this court
that there is no prima facie
case against the defendant- The
charges are therefore.dismissed.
The-defendant is ordered released
and hail is vacated.

LAMAR PARMENTEL
Thank you, Your Honor.

JUD'GE NOLAND
Court.is adjourned.

The family engulfs Remy, Uncles, Cousins, pumping his
hand, pounding his back. Wplants a big kiss on Lamar
Parmentelis cheek.

Remy watches. Anne alone at the counsel table, packing her
briefcase, disgusted. She squeezes through the crowd,
throws a sidelong glance at Remy as she goes.

He' 3 staring: right at her. She turnes quickly away,
hurrying out.

Remy is whispering to UNCLE SAL. They are both watching
the departing figure of Anne. Uncle Sal. is nodding.

CUE TO:

EXT. LEVEE BY THE RIVER - LATE AFTER - DAY

_Anne is running. In well-worn sweat-clothes, on top
of the high levee that separates the river from the
city. Running purges her demons. As she runs, all
the anger and humiliation of the courtroom begin

to disappear from her face.

She glances over her shoulder, notices a police car,
pacing her from behind on the road below. She keeps
running in long, loping strides. Then looks back
again.

ANNE'S POV - THE POLICE CAR

Suddenly its flashing blue light goes on, and the car
veers off the road and accelerates up the grassy incline
to the top of the levee.

Anne stops, frightened. The police car pulls up beside
her- Uncle Sal. steps out.

‘ UNCLE SAL
Miss Osborne, would you. please
come with me?

ANNE
What?‘ Where?
UNCLE SAL

I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm not
at liberty to say.

He takes her gently by the elbow, starts to lead her-
toward the car.

ANNE

What's this supposed to be,
a joke? '
UNCLE;SAL
No.mafam. '
ANNE

Am»: under arrest?
Uncle Sal shrugs.

ANNE
Whatfs the charge?

UNCLE SAL
(looks around)
Well, you jaywalked on the way
over here.. you've been trespassing
since you went through that.hole
in the.fence...

She yanks her elbow from his grasp.

UNCLE SAL
(continuing)
And that could be construed
as resisting arrest.

Ann glowers at him.

' ANNE '
Haven't I seen you before?..
Is your name, by any chance,
McSwain?

Uncle Sal smiles, nods, guides her into the car.

ANNE

to Uncle.Lafayette's redition of "Ma Negresse". People
are.dancing on a big piece of linoleum spread out on the
grass.

Remy's brother, Bobby, is dancing with McCabe, who looks
like a girl for the-first time. Kellom is presiding over
(the barbeque, wearing a.chef's toque, and a t-shirt
emblazoned with a flaming bottle of Tabasco sauce. Several
dogs watch him expectantly. The song ends- Everybody
cheers. Dodge hands Kellom a beer, and Kellom steps up
onto the porch to make a speech.

KELLOM
Boy, these Cajuns know how to
throw a party, donlt they?
' ‘ (cheers)

' KELLOM (continued)
Lemme get serious for a minute.
Those of us on the force know
' that injustice is often a part

Everybody joins in the toast Kellom gives Remy a big bear
hug. Remy's embarrassed, squirms out of his grasp. The
band starts up again.

A-pair of headlights crosses the bride and‘parks on the
road in front ot the house ---it's Uncle Sal's police car.
Remy starts-across the lawn toward the car. Anne comes
bursting out of the back seat and storms up to him.

ANNE
So now you're.adding kidnapping
and false arrest to the list of
your‘crimes.

‘ REM! .
Why you’re not under arrest.
Did Uncle Sal here give you

In the house. Come on,
Illl show you.

ANNE
I can find it myself.

'She brushes past him,. suddenly finds herself facing a
swarm of dancing, drinking cops and Cajuns. She takes
a deep. breath and starts through them toward the house.
Familiar faces from the courtroom glance at her - —
some benignly curious, others hostile.

What's she doing here?

Remy starts to follow her, when he is sidetracked by his
nepher, Justin, 7, tugging at. his trousers.

REM?
Hey. Justin. ‘

Remy, playing in the band, watches Anne emerge from the
house. Mama follows her, and carries the bucket of
crawfish to a big lawn table, where she dumps it into
a bright red mound.

Anne-watches from a few yards off as people gather around
and dig in. Captain Kellom and DeSoto are eating
.voraciously, their mouths and hands dripping with sauce.
Kellom spots Anne and he and.De Soto carry a serving of
crawfish over to her.
KELLOM
Never eat crawfish before? Here,

I‘m-Irish, so I give it to DeSoto.

DeSoto and Kellom laugh as DeSoto sucks the-crawfish's
head.

ON THE PORCH:

Remy,-playing with the band, looks across the crowd
toward Anne. He Steps to the front of the porch and
sings to her. '

REMY -
“You used to call me_in the
morning. You used to call.me
late at night...Now you.don't
call me anymore.’ Why, oh why;
Why, tell me why, why don't

friends. Her.cheeks burn as all.call bn.her to dance.
with Remy, literally shoving the two together.
Finally, against her-will, and only under the joyful
pressure from those assembled does she agree. The
music strikes up once again. A cheer rises from the
crowd, and Remy escorts Anne out to the makeshift
.dance floor. Remy is at.his most charming. Anne
glares- When the band.finishes..- ‘

ANNE
Satisfied?

REMY
Still.mad at me, huh?

You don't.get it, do you.
I.hate everything you stand

Anne turns and walks away. Remy watches her go.

His face frozen. A taxi comes over the bridge and
pulls up in front of the house. Anne trots toward
it, and quick jumps in. Justin appears from behind
a-parked.oar, staring at.Remy, having heard it all.

a wiretap on these two guys.

Right. And we know that_Freddie
Angelo went to veracruz three
days before he was killed.

DESOTO
Narcotics says Freddie never
dealt personally with less
than twenty, thirty keys.

REMY .

Now, that.could'explain.a-gang
way. One kilo of heroin always
seemed.too small-time for eight
people to get killed over. But
twenty, thirty keys makes a lot
more sense.. So where's.the rest
of it?

Anne drops down from the tree. Remy grabs her by
the shoulders, shakes her.

REM!
What's the goddamn secret? No
bullshit now Anne. Whatls this
evidence you people have of police
involvement in the Freddie Angelo
killing? '

Anne is startled by his intensity but not shaken by
it; she thinks for a.second. '

ANNE
I gather you're beginning to
think that the cops were

involved.
Yes.

ANNE
Why?

REM!

That was an unmarked police
car--a.piece-of-shit four-door
with no chrome. Besides, you
know anybody that can.drive like
that? The only way to learn those
kind of moves is years of pursuit
driving-.- Now, what do you know?

ANNE
We have an eyewitness who saw
two men in an unmarked police
car-dump Freddie Angelo's body
in the Piazza d'Italia.

REMY
How did they know it was an
unmarked police car?

ANNE
She saw the blue light and
the radio on the seat.

REM!
Why did you withhold that
information from the police?

ANNE
Because the police are the
suspects.

‘Remy's face is a map of devastation, as this
information sinks in.

. REM!
(to himself)
There is.no gang war, is there.

Remy looks around, coming out of his daze. Band
members are picking themselves up. One or two
people are.down and.hleeding. The WAILING of Daddy
Mention’s family pours over the wall. A police

car pulls up on Basin Street; we hear other sirens
approaching.

. ANNE:
So what are you going to _
do.about‘it?

Remy rubs his eyes and forehead. .The more he thinks
about this, the more painful it is.

REME.‘
I don't know. The Police .
Department is my goddamn
family.

ANNE
These_people are killers,
Remy.

Remy looks at her intensely. He replaces his
pistol.in its-holster. He's.shaken, thinking

hard. Two more police cars.pull up. Remy

watches the boys in blue jumping out of their cars,
guns drawn throwing their weight around--all murder
suspects, for the first time.

REMY
(almost a whisper)
What do you want me to do?
Go undercover in my own
precinot'house...?

ANNE
I‘ve got a better idea...

Remy looks at her curiously. A fourth police car
pulls up near the mouth of the alley. A UNIFORMED
COP recongizes him-

Sal pushes.him away, turns to DeSoto. DeSoto
immediately pulls up his trouser leg, revealing a
small pistol.in an ankle holster, and a hunting
knife strapped.to his calf.

He starts pulling things out of pockets and hidden
recesses of his clothing; a small.automatic, a tiny

are affixed to the rail. They-read: "SEALED BY ORDER --
NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT".

"INT. “LA MORDIDA"'--CABIN - DAY

Hands pull up the carpet, revealing a.seemingly unbroken
teak deck. They feel around and find a soft floorboard.
Using a knife, they pry up the board. Underneath are'
stacks-of tightly-wrapped clear plastic packets of
brownish-white powder, sealed with waterproof tape.

INT. REMY'S LEBARON - TRAVELING - SUNSET

Remy's at the wheel, careening along an endless row of
empty-and filled warehouses that line the Mississippi.

ANNE
How do you know where this boat
is?‘ V

REMY

Dodge and DeSoto impounded a
boat the night Freddie Angelo

was killed.

ANNE
You mean they're the killers?
Those two clowns?

CUT TO:
EXT. BISSO'S MARINE SALVAGE 9 NIGHT

The CAMERA moves across the salvage-strewn yard, through
the half-open gate, and creeps slowly toward "La Mordida".

Kellom appears in the doorway of the.oabin, coming up the
stairs with an armload of'plastic packets of heroin. He
looks up, straight at.the CAMERA.

DODGE:(O.C.)
Rey, Captain, you're under
arrest.

The deafening-BLASTS of two shotguns fire.from behind the
CAMERA. Kellom is knocked backwards down the stairs.
Plastic packets of heroin explode, throwing clouds of
white powder in the air.

Remy and Anne come down the gravel road and step onto the
dock.

EXT. “AUTHORIZED PER$ONNEL ONLY" GATE - SAME

Remy sees the gate is open, pulls his gun, motions Anne
to stay there. 'As soon as he steps through the gate, she
follows. ' ‘r’”‘ ‘

EXT. "LA MORDIDA" --SAME

‘ It's.deadly quiet. Remy cautiously approaches "La
Mordida", slips down onto the deck, gun poised. He hears
a SOUND behind him, whirls, pointing his gun -- it's_
Anne.‘ He angrily waves her away, but she Jumps down
beside-him onto the boat.

ANNE
(whispers)-

Don't tell anybody, but I'm
afraid of the dark.

Remy slides along the wall.of the cabin, peeks cautiously
around the corner.

REMY'S POV - THE CABIN ENTRANCE

A thin cloud of white powder lingers over the entrance.
Broken and shredded packets and.mounds of brownish-white
powder cover the-deck.

Remy steals up to the-doorway, kneels, scoops up some

heroin, examines it- WE HEAR a GROAN-from below. Remy

spins, the adrenalin pumping through his veins, pointing
the gun down the stairs.

REMY'S POV'— THE CABIN

Kellom lies inert at the foot of the steps, covered in
blood and brownish-white powder. His_eyes flutter-open.
He sees.Remy. He tries to speak.

DODGE:(O.C.)
Put dewn the gun.

Anne turns around, her heart clenching -- Dodge and
DeSoto have their shotguns trained on her and Remy. Remy
puts down the gun but doesn't otherwise move. He's still
staring at Kellom.

KELLOM'
I‘m sorry...
He dies. I
DESOTO
{to Remy) '

Now the other one.

Remy does exactly as he’s told; takes out his'Second gun,
drops it,_rising to face them. His left fist is
clenched; Hglﬁ carefully holding onto the heroin.

DESOTO
(continuing)
We had a perfect situation, and
you had to screw it up.

. . DODGE- .
Youjiuzned on.us Remy.

REM}
Maybe we can make a deal...

Anne looks at him, shocked.

ANNE
Remy!
REMY
Shut up!
.. DESOTO .
_(laughs)

That's the old Remy!

. REM!
What do you say?

. DODGE _
(motions with shotgun)
Climb up on the dock.

Remy takes Annefs arm to help her Jump across-the foot of
black water between the boat and the-dock. Suddenly he_
flings his handful of heroin into Dodge and DeSoto's
faces, shoves Anne down into the water and jumps for the
dock; Dodge and DeSoto recover quickly and fire into the

dock just behind Remy who rolls across the dock and into
the water. .

- DESOTO
YOu get him? .

DODGE
I don't know. They're both in
the water.

DESOTO

Shi 1:1.

IN THE WATER _
Anne catches hold of the canvas cover of’a dinghy hung

behind a big Chris-Craft. The black water of the river
is freezing cold and Anne is terrified.

UNDER THE DOCK

Remy has swum under the floating dock; he's hanging on to
a line.dangling from a slip on the opposite side from the
point he dove into the water. Cautiously poking his head
up, Remy sees... -

ANGLE ON POLICE‘DOCK - RENY'S POV

...Dodge and DeSoto, their back to him, Split up to hunt

for Remy and Anne. Dodge starts down slip 11 while
DeSoto takes slip 15.

ANNE

raises her head above the-stern of the Chris-Craft, to
see...

DODGE
less than ten feet away.
ANNE

drops down into the water Just as DeSoto's shotgun blows
a great chunk out of the boat's transom above her head.

SLIP 1O
Remy has climbed on board a.30' sailing yacht; he freezes

when he hears the SHOTGUN BLAST, then with numb fingers
tries to wrench open the cabin hatch. It's no use.

IN THE WATER

Anne is trying to swim silently below the dock. She
hears footsteps. ‘

ABOVEiHER

Dodge is on the dock, looking into the black water to the
right and left-

EXT; POLICE DOCK - SLIP 10 - NIGHT
Remy uses a winch handle to break into'the yacht's

cabin -- the hatch cover lock gives way with a LOUD
CRACK.

DESOTO

' three slips away,'spins around at the SOUND of the crack.
‘He starts to walk in the direction of the noise.

SAILING YACHT --IN THE CABIN

Remy scrambles around in the dark cabin of the boat. His
groping hands locate the radio, but there's no power.
Right beside the radio Remy discovers a flare gun and a
box of shells.

BELOW-THE.DOCK

Anne knows that Dodge is directly above her, but her
teeth are chattering, she can't help it. She clamps her
teeth down on the sleeve of her coat.

SAILING YACHT

Remy, armed with the flare gun, throws the. winch handle
onto the dock. .

DESOTO
‘fires at the SOUND-
RENT

pops up out of the hatch and fires his flare gun
carefully at DeSot.o.

DESOTO

catches the flare in his stomach. He screams.
REMY

jumps from the motor-sailer to the slip and from there he.
jumps on board the next boat, a 35— foot cabin crui.ser
with a flying bridge.

DESOTO

is on his knees, screaming in agony, as the magnesium
flare burns.at 2000 degrees in his belly, glowing
hellishly so that his abdomen is lit from within.
DODGE

-sprints toward his partner, shotgun ready.

DESOTO

slumps backward, unconscious and dying; the grotesque
flare still burns in his gut.

BELOW THE DOCK

Anne.can't hear anyone above her now. She swims toward
the side of the dock and starts to climb up onto it.

REMY

swings out from behind the bridge of the cabin cruiser
and tries to get off a shot at Dodge, but...

DODGE'

sees the movement and fires at Remy.
THE SHOTGUN BLAST

tears a chunk out of the lower bridge of the cabin
cruiser; it just misses Remy, who climbs up...

THE FLYING BRIDGE

right at the.top of the cabin cruiser. There's a
movement in the corner of his eye; Remy twists and fires.

THE FLARE

ricochets off the dock and arcs up over the small boat
harbor, bursting into a red star pattern before hitting
the water.

SLIP 16

Dodge-fires again.at the cabin cruiser, and...

REMY'I '

leaps down off the flying bridge.

DOWN‘THE DOCK

Anne has now crawled up out of the water onto a slip. She
hesitates; should she run for help, stay out of sight,
what? .Then she sees DeSoto's body and crawls toward it.
DODGE

leaps on board the bow of the cabin cruiser and fires
twice at the rear of the'boat, where he knows Remy must

be-lurking. With his pump action shotgun and plenty of
shells, Dodge has a big advantage over.-.

VREMT

who tries to reload the single-shot flare gun with frozen
fingers as the SHOTGUN BLASTS send splinters flying past
him. As soon as it's loaded Remy jumps up and fires.

WIDER.ANGLE.-- THE FLARE

smashes through the windscreen of the cabin cruiser,
flies over Dodge, caroms off a metal fitting and lodges
in the hold of "La Mordida". A fire starts at once.

DODGE
leaps up onto the bridge, firing his shotgun;

ANOTHER ANGLE"

...Dodge has.plenty of time to bring the shotgun up to
his shoulder for a clear shot at Remy.

ANNE

fires the-dead man's shotgun at Dodge; the recoil knocks
her flat on her back and she misses.

DODGE_

. whips around, and in that instant...
REMY

fired his flare gun, and...
THE‘FLARE

smashes into Dodge's back, through the ribs; the white—
hot metal instantly vaporizes Dodge's 1ungs.. Dodge
pitches forward off the flying bridge, bounces off the

railing of the lower bridge, and falls from there into
the water. He's dead before he hits it. .

WIDE ANGLE

The fire on "La Hordida" is Spreading fast; flames leap
up the masts, Anne stands on the dock, still holding the
shotgun, water streaming off her. Remy Sprints toward
her, grabs her hand and they run for shore.

REMY AND ANNE
sprint up the main dock and LEAP toward the shore as
”LA MORDIDA"

EXPLODES with a low WHUMP, sending flaming debris up and
out two hundred feet. ‘

CUT TO:
INT. ANNE‘S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Remy and Anne fall onto her bed (as if they had leaped
from the dock to here) -- roll together into an embrace.

ANNE
You really had me worried back
there... when you offered to
make a deal with those animals.

RENT
(grins)
I told you, chere -- we're the
Good Guys!

He moves to kiss her.

Suddenly the sounds of TWO BEEPERS go off. Anne and Remy
instinctively reach for theirs.

EXT. ANNIE'S'APARTMENT - BEDROOM WINDOW ~ NIGHT

Two beepers come flying out_the window. CAMERA FANS with
them as they SPLASH into the river and are carried away
by the current. '

pulling away from the city, to the tune of ROCKIN' SIDNEY
singing "Alligator Waltz".
