THE PUNISHER

by

Robert Mark Kamen.

First Draft March 1, 1988

OPEN TO:

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT * NIGHT

On a deserted rain slicked street, FRANK CASTLE watches a
heavy equipment warehouse thirty yards down the road through
the windshield of a non-descript vehicle, parked in the
shadows. His partner JAKE BERKOWITZ, slightly rumpled,
slightly older, dozes next to him. Castle extracts a
package from a paper sack and begins to unwrap it. Inside
is a beautifully prepared meal, complete with napkin and
utensils. Mischievously Castle crumbles the wrapping paper
loudly. Berkowitz wakes and squints over at him
malevolently as Castle pretends to go about his business.

CASTLE
Good morning Princess.

Berkowitz grumbles, looking at his watch.

BERKOWITZ
Three o'clock. They were supposed
to be here two hours ago. I don't
know why they call them organized
crime. The assholes are never on
time for anything.

He looks at Castle eating, not with a little envy. He pulls
a soggy paperbag out from under his seat and extracts a
leaky cup of coffee and a soggy sandwich.

CASTLE
Why do you eat like that?

BERKOWITZ
Because I'm a bachelor, that's
why. I don't have someone in
my life who loves me enough to
prepare gourmet fucking meals
everytime I go on a stake out.

_ CASTLE
Yes you do.

Castle takes another package out of his bag and hands it to
Berkowitz. Berkowitz beams and tosses his soggy fare out
the window. He bites into a wedge of pie.

BERKOWITZ
she's too good for you. You
know that.

CASTLE
(warm)
Yeah. I do.

A car pulls up to the warehouse. Two men get out and enter
the warehouse. One carries a suitcase.

CASTLE
Rockenwroll.

Castle is out of the car in a flash, gun in hand. Berkowitz
stuffs the rest of the pie into his mouth and follows.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE

Heavy machinery stands like dinosaurs in the shadows. In a
small lit area in the middle of the room seven men stand
around a table on which the open suitcase sits, filled with
clear plastic bags of white powder. The two men who brought
the bag, visibly anxious, watch as the CHEMIST checks the
powder for purity with a test kit. Their eyes flick from
the test to the four men across from them. Three thugs, BIG
LOU,.TOUGH TONY and FRANKIE THE FIST, flanking their boss,
an extremely stylishly dressed, impeccably coiffed hood,
DAPPER DINO MORETTI. The Chemist looks at Moretti and
shakes his head.

CHEMIST
Only sixty percent pure.

COURIER NO. 1
That's impossible. Do it again.

Moretti's expression doesn't change.

MORETTI
Where's the other forty percent?

COURIER NO. 2
This thing is off.

As he goes to grab the test kit, he accidently gets some
white powder on Moretti's suit sleeve. Everyone freezes.
Moretti stares at the spot as if it were an anathema to his
very soul.

COURIER
(nervous)
Sorry Mr. Moretti.

Moretti looks at his thugs. In a flash they grab the two
men and force their right hands onto the table.

COURIER
Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

Moretti picks up a steel bar and viciously smashes it across
each man's hand twice. The men shriek. Moretti wags a pipe
under their pain contorted faces.

MORETTI
(calm)
Monday a hand. Tuesday an arm.
Wednesday a head. I want my
other forty percent. Understand?

He taps the first man's chin with a pipe. The man nods.

MORETTI
And if you ever get me dirty
again you son-of-a-bitch, your
wife's a widow.

CASTLE (V.O.)
Don't move, police!

Everyone turns to Castle on one end and Berkowitz on the
other end of the room, guns raised, jumping from behind the
heavy equipment. The thugs pull their guns and start
firing. Castle and Berkowitz take cover and fire back. Two
thugs go down, the others head for cover. Moretti grabs the
suitcase of dope.

The gun battle ensues, with shots ringing off metal. Castle
is stalking around a piece of equipment when he sees two
thugs sighting up Berkowitz, who has the couriers and the
chemist cornered. Thinking quickly, Castle notices that the
men are moving in front of a frontloader. Castle hops from
where he is perched right into the driver's seat. He hits
the starter button, the thugs hear the sound, turn just in
time to see Castle bearing down on them with the
frontloader. Castle scoops them up and tosses them into the
dump truck. He smiles and waves at Berkowitz. A shot pings
next to his head. Berkowitz fires shooting an assailant who
has snuck up behind Castle. Castle jumps down.

CASTLE
Where's Moretti?

BERKOWITZ
I don't know.

A noise across the way turns Castle. His P.O.V. Moretti,
with the suitcase, running into a maze of machinery.

CASTLE
Stay here.

Castle rushes off. He races through the maze of machinery,
trading shots with Moretti trying to cut him off from the
rear door. The two men duck and dodge, using the machinery
to their best advantage. Moretti circles around behind
Castle and hits a switch. A derrick drops its bucket just
above where Castle is standing. Castle jumps out of the way
not a moment too soon, losing his gun. The bucket hits the
floor missing him by inches as he springs back up. His
P.C.V. Moretti about to reach the door. Castle looks
around. He cannot reach Moretti in time and his gun is
lost. Thinking quickly he grabs a block and tackle and
swings it for all he is worth. It misses its mark but not
by much, hitting the suitcase which flies apart. White
powder rains on Moretti. He glares at Castle and runs
through the exit door. By the time Castle exits, the
streets are deserted. He stares up the streets, a hunter
thwarted; the rain running down his resolute face.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE'S HOUSE

Berkowitz is dropping Castle off.

BERKOWITZ
So did we do good tonight or
what?

CASTLE

We could have done better.

BERKOWITZ
We nailed thirty ki's of smack
and six wise guys. What more do
you want?

CASTLE
I want to nail the man.

BERKOWITZ
who, that sleaze bag Moretti?

CASTLE
The other sleeze bag. His boss,
Franco.

The house door opens. A woman appears on the porch in a
robe, silhouetted by the light inside.

BERKOWITZ
Shift change.

Castle goes to exit.

CASTLE
I'll see you tomorrow.

BERKOWITZ
Yeah. Listen Frank you want to do
yourself a favor? Tomorrow's your
birthday. Give yourself a gift.
Cut yourself a little slack.

CASTLE
I will.
BERKOWITZ
(warmly)

Bullshit. Kiss the kids.

Berkowitz drives off. Castle mounts the steps to his wife
JULIE, who greets him with open arms and adoring eyes.

JULIE
How‘s my hero tonight?

CASTLE
Okay.

JULIE
Just okay?

she kisses Castle softly.

CASTLE
Well, better than okay.

She kisses him again, with full passion. Their eyes come
away sparkling with each other. Castle scoops Julie up in
his arms and enters the house. P.O.V. someone else. A
moment later the light goes off.

PULL BACK TO:
The SOMEONE ELSE

Dapper Dino Moretti watches the house from behind the wheel
of his car. His anger etched in stone on his face.

CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE BEDROOM * MORNING

PAN a sunwdappled room. On one wall pictures and citations:
Castle as a karate black belt. Castle and Berkowitz
graduating from Police Academy, clowning, Julie standing
proudly between them. The Castle family, with Berkowitz at
Halloween, all in costume. Frank and Julie on their wedding
day. And the citations: Detective of the Year. Patrolman
of the Year.

PAN past the door as it opens a crack. Two gun barrels
appear. The unseen gunmen's P.O.V. As they enter the room,
Frank and Julie asleep in each other's arms. The P.O.V.
moves closer, closer until it is right on top of Castle.
Castle opens his eyes. They fill with terror.

CASTLE
No! Please don't! No:

The sounds of shots-ring out. Castle grabs his chest and
falls off the bed. Giggling erupts as the Castles' two
daughters FELICE and ANNIE, six and four, flags saying Happy
Birthday, sticking out of the barrels of their toy guns,
jump on the bed and look over the side with Julie. Castle
lies very still on the floor. The girls look at each other,
when suddenly Castle springs up.

CASTLE
Urrgh! Super-Cop.

He pounces on the girls, kissing them furiously amidst gales
of giggles.

CASTLE

Kissing the enemies of law and
order into submission.

He looks up at Julie.

CASTLE
No one escapes his vengeful lips.

He grabs her, subjecting her to more of the same. The whole
family falls off the bed. A gleeful jumble of arms and legs
tangled in the bedding.

CUT TO:

INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM

Castle is tying the bow into the back of Annie‘s party
dress.

ANNIE
Daddy, what's divorce?

CASTLE
Where did you learn that word?

ANNIE
From Katherine in school. Her
parents are getting it.

CASTLE
Divorce is when a mom and dad
don't live together anymore.

ANNIE
How come?

CASTLE

Lots of different reasons,
sweetheart.

ANNIE
Are you and mommy going to get
divorced?

CASTLE
Never.

ANNIE
Good.

She turns and hugs her father for all she's worth.

BERKOWITZ (V.O.)
Hello.

Annie runs off.

ANNIE
Uncle Jake!

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN

Berkowitz is in the kitchen. Both kids pounce into his arms
and smother him with kisses.

BOTH
Did you bring them?

BERKOWITZ
what?

ANNIE
Our presents .
BERKOWITZ

It's not your birthdays. Why
should I bring you presents?

FELICE
Because you love us.

BERKOWITZ
Ah, the magic words.

He takes little watches out of his pocket. The kids squeal
with delight as Julie enters and kisses Berkowitz
affectionately.

KIDS
Mommy, look._

The kids show off their watches.

BERKOWITZ
That pie was the high point of
my night.

JULIE

That's not what I heard. The
rest is in the fridge.

Berkowitz makes a beeline for the refrigerator and digs into
the pie, at home. Castle enters wearing a sport jacket and
a fish tie.

BERKOWITZ
Don't we look nice.

FELICE
Do you like the tie?

ANNIE
We bought it with our money.

BERKOWITZ
I love it. It‘s so him.

CASTLE
Your mother-in-law makes lasagna
dinner in your honor, the least
you can do is look nice. By the
way in case you forgot, we're
eating in an hour.

Berkowitz continues to gobble pie, ignoring him.
BERKOWITZ

I didn't forget. I'm warming up
for the main event.

The phone rings.

JULIE
Hello.

Her smile dies a bit as she hands the phone to Castle.

JULIE
The Captain.

CASTLE
Yes Sir.

Castle's mouth tightens.

CASTLE
We’re on the way.

He hangs up and looks at Julie apologetically.

CASTLE
Franco's leaving the country in
an hour. The judge just issued
a subpoena.

BERKOWITZ
I'll go.

Julie looks at Castle reading his conflict correctly.

JULIE
Go.

CASTLE
The party.

JULIE

The party will wait. This won't.
You've been working on him two
years. It means something to you.

10.

CASTLE
Not as much as you do.

He takes her in his arms and kisses her tenderly.

BERKOWITZ
I'll be in the car.

CASTLE
I'm coming. Meet you at your
mother's.

JULIE
Good luck.

Castle runs out.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOUSE

Two cars are parked in the driveway side by side. A station
wagon and a Camero. Castle and Berkowitz hop into the
Camero. Castle inserts the key when he notices the front
tire of the station wagon is flat.

CASTLE
Come on, we'll take your car.

The two men exit and hurry towards Berkowitz's car at the
curb.

CASTLE
Jules.

JULIE (0.5.)
What?

CASTLE
The station wagon has a flat,
take my car. The keys are in
the ignition.

JULIE (0.3.)
Okay, thanks.

Berkowitz and Castle enter the car. Castle begins to remove
his fish tie.

BERKOWITZ
Hey, what are you doing?

ll.

CASTLE
Can you see Franco's face if I hand
him a subpoena in this.

BERKOWITZ
(smiles)
Yeah. Keep it on.
(beat)
You know, you got a nice family.
CASTLE
I keep telling you. You should
have one.
BERKOWITZ

I already do. They just live
someplace else.

CASTLE
Oh yeah, where's that?

BERKOWITZ
Your house.

Castle smiles warmly and knots his tie up again. Berkowitz
puts the car in gear and drives off.

CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT

Two limos pull up to the entrance. Moretti and a half a
dozen henchmen exit from one, and form a protective squadron
around the other. Moretti opens the door and an ENGLISH
GOVERNESS steps out followed by five year old TOMMY, excited
to be at the airport.

TOMMY
Come on, Dad!

A moment passes, and then GIANNI FRANCO emerges; impeccable
tailoring, perfectly cut hair. A man exuding confidence.
Power. Control.

FRANCO
Was it taken care of?

Moretti nods, with a cruel smile.
TOMMY

(impatient)
Dad: The planesl

12.

Franco smiles, takes his son's hand and allows himself to be
pulled into the terminal. The bodyguards follow him
closely.

CUT TO:

INT. BERKOWITZ'S CAR

Stuck in traffic across two dividing islands and a walkway,
Berkowitz and Castle see Franco's entourage enter the
airport. Berkowitz hits his horn. Castle springs into
action, jumping out of the car.

CASTLE
Meet me in the front.

Castle dashes across the roadways, dodging traffic, hurdling
dividers, heading for the terminal.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLES' HOUSE
Julie and the kids head for the Camero.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRLINE TERMINAL

Franco strides down the corridor towards the gate talking to
Moretti.

FRANCO
With that son-of~a~bitch out of
the way everything should run
smooth until I come back. You
keep it the way I set it up and
we got no problems, just profits.
Right?

MORETTI
Right.

TOMMY
Hey Dad, look.

Franco stops and joins his son at a window. Their P.O.V.
A 747 lifting off.

13.

TOMMY
Do you know how they make planes
fly dad?

FRANCO

It has to do with the air.
He takes a model plane Tommy is holding and demonstrates.

FRANCO
See as the engine pushes the plane
forward, the air gets underneath
and lifts the wings. When the
wings lift, the nose lifts then
the power from the back pushes
here and off we go.

TOMMY
You know everything, don't you,
Dad?

FRANCO
I wish.

MORETTI
(anxious)
Hey boss, we ain't got time.
Franco scoops Tommy up and continues down the corridor.
FRANCO
I ever tell you about the first
time grandpa took me to Europe?
TOMMY
You mean when you throwed up on
him?
Franco smiles. The entourage hurries on.

CUT TO:

INT. TERMINAL
Castle consults the flight board and runs down the corridor.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE’S HOUSE

Julie seatbelts the kids in the rear of the Camero. She
buckles herself in and goes to turn the ignition.

CUT TO:

14.

INT. CAR

Berkowitz pulls up to the curb outside the terminal. His
radio crackles. He picks up the mike.

BERKOWITZ
Yeah?

CUT TO:

INT. TERMINAL

Castle runs through the metal detector which goes off. He
flashes his badge, sprinting down the hall. His P.O.V.
Franco saying goodbye to his men at the gate. Castle turns
on the speed, reaching Franco as he is about to enter the
airplane. Castle hurdles a barrier, ending up right in
front of Franco who looks at Moretti surprised.

CASTLE
Going somewhere, Gianni?

FRANCO
It appears that way.

CASTLE
Not anymore.

MORETTI
Hey, what do you want?

TOMMY
Are you a real policeman?

Castle looks down at Tommy eyeing the shield on his jacket.

CASTLE
That's right.

TOMMY
Well where's your gun?

CASTLE
This your boy?

Franco nods, Castle bends down.

CASTLE
(conspiratorial)
I keep it hidden so I won't scare
people.

15.

TOMMY
(serious)
Oh. (beat) That's a good idea.

CASTLE
Is that your Nanny?

TOMMY
thhuhl

CASTLE

Why don't you go over to her
while I talk to your dad.

TOMMY
Okay.

Tommy scampers over t0 the governess.

FRANCO
Thanks.

CASTLE
I did it for him. Not you.

He pulls a subpoena out of his pocket and stuffs it in
Franco's pocket.

CASTLE
_See you in court.

Moretti steps between them.

MORETTI
What are you trying to pull?

Before Castle can react Berkowitz's voice turns him.

BERKOWITZ
Frank.

Berkowitz comes running up.
BERKOWITZ
You gotta come right away. There's
been an accident at home.

Castle is stunned. Caught unawares.

BERKOWITZ
Come on, it's serious!

Castle turns, and then something strikes him. He turns
again, to Franco. The two men lock eyes. Castle runs off.

16.

FRANCO
I thought you took care of it.

MORETTI
I did. Personally.

Franco's mouth draws tight. He takes the subpoena out of
his pocket and throws it on the floor.

FRANCO
Deal with it.

Franco boards the plane with his son and governess.

CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE'S BLOCK

Berkowitz's car, with Castle at the wheel, comes racing down
the street, screeching to a halt in front of a growing
crowd. Castle and Berkowitz rush out.

Their P.0.V. through a crowd being held back by police.
Castle's Camero in flames. The flames licking perilously
close to the propane gas tanks on the side of the house.

V.O.
Get back! It's going to hit
the gas tanks.

CASTLE
(frantic)
NoI

Sirens sound in the background. Castle rushes forward.
Berkowitz restrains him.

BERKOWITZ
Frank, it's too late! There's
nothing you can do.

CASTLE
Let go.

Castle tries to pull away. Berkowitz holds on.
BERKOWITZ
Frank, the tanks! The flames
are almost at the tanks!

People start running. Castle punches Berkowitz in the jaw.
He breaks free and rushes toward the burning car.

l7.

v.0.
Watch out!

The flames reach the tanks. The entire screen explodes in a
massive fire ball.

The flames die. The screen goes black. Castle's voice
seared by anger and tremendous loss speaks from the
darkness.

CASTLE (V.O.)
People say when a man begins to
talk to God he‘s either found his
way or lost his mind. I talk to
God all the time. I'm not looking
for the way and I don't care if
I've lost my mind. I just want to
know if what I am doing is right
or wrong but no matter how many
times I ask I get no answer. Does
that mean there is no God or just
no answer?

A low bass pulses on the soundtrack filling the screen.
SUPERIMPOSED. Five years later.

CUT TO:

EXT. COURTHOUSE

The courthouse doors fly open. Flash bulbs pop. T.V.
cameras roll as DAPPER DINO MORETTI, dressed to the nines,
flanked by his henchmen, sweeps out triumphantly.

ANNOUNCER
This is Larry Silvers at the
Courthouse where moments ago,
after deliberating for ten
weeks, a jury has declared Dino
Moretti, the Dapper Don, innocent
of all charges including the
murder of Detective Frank Castle
and his family nearly five years
ago. Mr. Moretti, how does it
feel to be finally acquitted?

MORETTI
Great! Just great.

ANNOUNCER
The government says it's going
to appeal. How do you feel about
that?

18.

MORETTI
Let 'em appeal, a hundred times.
I'll still win. This is America.
If you're innocent, justice prevails.

ANNOUNCER
Are you worried about the Punisher?

Moretti's smile fades.

MORETTI
Let me tell you something about the
Punisher, whoever he is. If he
ever shows up within one thousand
yards of me, he'll learn just what
the word punished really means.
Now, if you’ll excuse me.

Moretti and his entourage pile into two limousines and pull

away.

The mikes shut

There you have it. The Dapper Don

styled vigilante in the last five

ANNOUNCER
Let's go.

off after the media caravan.

CUT TO:

19.

INT. MORETTI'S HOUSE

Moretti enters to a big victory banner strung across the
luxurious foyer of his elegant home. There is a cake
decorated with a picture of Moretti in flamboyant icing,
kicking a figure of justice in the ass. The three body
guards, MIKEY, JOEY and DANNY, give Moretti a round of
applause.

MORETTI
So enough with the applause.
Where’s champagne?

TONY
I'll get it.

Moretti stops him.
MORETTI
You check the house. I'll get
the champagne. And let's get
some music going here.

He hits the switch on the wall. Music blasts throughout the
house. The bodyguards spread out.

CUT TO:

INT. INTERIOR ATTIC

A louvered window opens. Two black boots hit the floor.
CLOSE UP one boot, the stylized skull. A hand reaches up
and pulls the skull up. A thin blade comes out of an
invisible sheath built into the boot.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM

Mikey hears steps across the ceiling. He unholsters his gun
and opens the door. He takes one step. A leather-jacketed
arm swings down like a sledge bearing the skull dagger deep
in Mikey's chest. Mikes falls back into the room.

CUT TO:

20.

ANOTHER BEDROOM

Joey hears sounds outside. He rushes into the hall, gun
drawn and looks around. He looks down from the landing over
the railing, seeing nothing, he turns back around as two
boots thud into his chest. He falls over the railing. His
screams drowned out by the music. Danny, another bodyguard,
comes running out of the den down below. He sees Joey's
body.

DANNY
Jesus, Joey.

He bends over Joey. A nylon noose descends from the landing
and falls around Danny's neck. Too late, the noose cuts
into his neck as he is yanked off the floor, his feet
kicking frantically in the air.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN

Moretti is topping off the last of the champagne glasses,
singing to the music. Moretti lifts the silver tray with
five glasses and exits the kitchen, pushing the door open
with his backside.

_ MORETTI
Okay, party time.

He turns into the floyer and stops, mortified, the tray
crashing to the floor. His P.O.V. Joey dead on the floor,
Danny hanging by his neck ten feet above him. Moretti grabs
Joey's gun.

MORETTI
Mikey! Tony!

There are no responses. Moretti stalks through the house,
his heart beating, sweat dappling his brow.

_ MORETTI
Hey, quit fuckin' around.

Moretti moves down a hallway, opening doors, leading with
his gun. He hears a noise behind and turns ready to fire.
Nothing is there. Momentarily off guard, he turns, again
his eyes open wide at what he sees confronting him.

MORETTI
You!

21.

He raises the gun and fires.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOUSE

The news teams, loitering across the street, jump with the
shots. They spring into action, grabbing their cameras,
running for the house. They barely make the other side of
the street when the house explodes from within. The
reporters hit the deck. As the front door opens, they look
up. Their 9.0.V. Smoke pours out the door. A moment
lapses and Moretti, his clothing in tatters, singed, his
eyes glazed with a far away stare walks out of the smoking
house. His gun hangs limply at his side.

REPORTERS
Where are those cameras? Get
them rolling.

Moretti stands for a long moment and then keels over face
first.

CLOSE UP
HIS BACK
The skull dagger plunged to the hilt.

REPORTER #1
The Punisher! It's the Punisher!

REPORTER #2
Look!

P.O.V. all. Through the smoke and flames a spectral figure,
an apparition, stands staring out through the inferno.

REPORTER
It's him! Get the goddamn
cameras going!

The flames leap higher. The figure disappears. A moment
later, the whole house blows up.

FADE TO:

EXT. MORETTI HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is a smoldering ruins. Police cars and fire
engines illuminate the scene. The press is kept behind a
cordon. A car drives up. Berkowitz, a little worse for the

22.

wear of the last five years, exits and heads for the house,
scouring the ground with his eyes for clues. The press,
seeing Berkowitz, break through the cordon and track with
him. He ignores them.

REPORTER #1
Lieutenant, is it true you're
being pressured to step down as
head of the Punisher Task Force?

BERKOWITZ
No comment.

REPORTER #2
Lieutenant, do you have any leads?

BERKOWITZV
NO comment .

Cold, dry, noncooperative, Berkowitz goes to enter the
house.

REPORTER #3
Lieutenant, do you still stick to
your theory that the late Frank
Castle and the Punisher are the
same person?

Berkowitz turns.

BERKOWITZ
Absolutely.

REPORTER
Despite the fact that the official
police department's statement is
that Castle died with his family.

BERKOWITZ
Don't you have anything better to
do at two o'clock in the morning,
Santana?

Berkowitz enters the house to Chief of Detectives O'Banion.
O'BANION
(sarcastic)
That was smart. Very smart.
Berkowitz ignores the barb.
BERKOWITZ

To what do I owe the honor of
the visit?

23.

The Chief hands Berkowitz the skull dagger. Berkowitz
peruses it, feeling its balance.

O'BANION
I have a message from the mayor.
I quote. Frank Castle is dead.
No more talk about him being
otherwise. You toe the line or
you get the boot.

Berkowitz fixes O'Banion with a stare.

BERKOWITZ
And you'd go along with that?

O'BANION
Jake, we can't let the public
think there's some psychotic
ex-cop running around wacking
out wise guys like he's got a
hunting license.

BERKOWITZ
Why not?

O'BANION
Berkowitz. I'm tired. It's
late. You're warned.

(pause)
What the hell ever happened
to you?

with the wagging of his head, the Chief exits. Berkowitz
continues to look for clues.

WOMAN'S v.0.
Lieutenant Berkowitz?

Berkowitz turns to SAMANTHA LEARY, a-young, bright detective
with something on her mind.

SAM
I'm detective Sam Leary.

She holds out her hand. Berkowitz ignores it.

BERKOWITZ
Sam?

SAM
Samantha.

Berkowitz rolls his eyes.

Berkowitz goes
for his car.

24.

BERKOWITZ
What can I do for you?
(sarcastic)
Sam.

SAM
I'd like a shot at being your
partner.

BERKOWITZ
I don't work with a partner.

SAM
I know, but you used to.

BERKOWITZ
Right. Used to. Past tense.

SAM
Look, I'm not after a free
ride. I can pull my share of
the load.

BERKOWITZ
I'm sure you can.

SAM
No you're not. You're not even
listening to me.

BERKOWITZ
That's right, I'm not.
SAM
Why?
BERKOWITZ

Because I worked with the best,
and anything else is a waste of
my fucking time. What do you
think, you're the first person
to apply for the job?

SAM
No, but I'm the most qualified.

BERKOWITZ
Based on what?

25.

SAM
I graduated first in my class at
the academy. I scored in the
top one percent of all officers
on the target. I made detective
first time up, second youngest
member of the force ever to...

Berkowitz cuts her off by getting in the car.

Have you already said to the world
here is justice. Here is punishment.

The camera tracks down a large pipe. At the end, a candle

The camera circles slowly to the front.

Here in me.

CLOSE UP CASTLE'S FACE

Eyes closed, sweat beading his forehead matting his hair.
His eyes open. The depths of pain and anger revealed. A

until the throbbing threatens to explode.

CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT

Reporters are gathered around a terminal exit. At the curb
a black limo waits, the door held open by JIM TARRONE, 28,
the mafia gone Yuppie via Versace. Tarrone scowls at the
reporters. The terminal doors swing open and three burly
bodyguards, carrying luggage, exit, followed by Franco as
self-assured and strongly handsome as ever; and Tommy,
nearly twelve, beside him. The same self-assurance in his
eye.

REPORTER
Mr. Franco, how does it feel to
be back home?

FRANCO
It's 30 minutes since I've landed.
So far, so good.

REPORTER
Have you come back to take over?

Tarrone intercedes.
TARRONE
Come on fellows, it was a long
flight. The man's tired. Let's
give him a break.

Tommy scrambles into the car. Franco is about to enter.

27.

REPORTER
Aren't you afraid of the
Punisher?

Franco stops, turns and smiles.

FRANCO
Punisher? You know what they
think in Europe? You guys made
that up to sell papers. There's
no Punisher.

REPORTER
Then what's been killing your
associates for the last five
years?

FRANCO
Too much red meat in their diet
maybe. Thanks for coming.

Franco is about to enter the limo when a car backfires. He
crouches, on edge. His bodyguards go for their guns. The
action doesn't go unnoticed by the news crew. After a
moment, Franco straightens up and enters the limo. Tarrone
follows, slamming the door behind him.

TARRONE
Let's hit it.

TOMMY
Hey dad, I didn't know you were

FRANCO
Neither did I. You remember your

TARRONE
I used to pull you around in that
wagon.

TOMMY

Oh yeah, hi.

28.

TARRONE
So how were those fancy European
schools we heard you were going
to?

TOMMY
All right.

FRANCO
Just all right! I got the next
Einstein here. Go sit in the
front. I want to talk to Jim
here.

Franco tussles Tommy's hair with real affection. Tommy
squirms through the partition into the front seat. Franco
raises the glass.

FRANCO
So how bad is it?

TARRONE

How bad? If you didn‘t come
home, I would be head of the
family. Is that a joke or what?
The only consolation is all the
other families are in the same
boat because of this psycho.
I mean Freddie Deleo is a capo,
a thirty year old mongoloid
with a driver's license and
he's in charge of 200 guys.

(beat)
None of us know what we're doing.
We're not experienced enough to
run a family.

FRANCO
There's not going to be any such
thing as families anymore, Jim.
It's old thinking, dead thinking.
The world’s changed and we haven't.
But we're going to.

TARRONE
What are we going to change into?

FRANCO
A corporation. There'll be no
more territories, no more wars.
Each group will be responsible
for one area of work. These

We're all going to work together

TARRONE
How are you goin' to convince
anyone of this?

FRANCO
With an act of good faith, so
generous, even Freddie Deleo
will see the light.

A week from now, I've arranged
for six hundred kilos of pure
junk to come in.

TARRONE
Six hundred kis?

FRANCO
Five hundred million dollars
worth. And everyone gets to
share. Provided they work
together to make it happen.
One group on security, one on
transportation, one on receiving,
one on distribution and one on
collection. That shouldn't be

too hard.

TARRONE
And what do we do about the
Punisher?

FRANCO

One thing at a time, Jim. First
we consolidate, then we obliterate.

INT. BAR

A room full of hustlers. Tough guys in sharp clothes,
drinking and carousing. SHAKESPEARE, a down and outer,
whose shabby clothes and five day stubble border on
dereliction, is trying to cadge a drink. He approaches a
flashy thug and speaks in rhyme with a florid theatrically
English accent.

SHAKE
Excuse me, kind sir, but I
can't help but see in you a
man far luckier than me.

MAN
(confused)
What?

SHAKE
What ever you can spare would
be sufficient I think, to
stand this thespian a very
stiff drink.

MAN
What the hell's a thespian?

SHAKE
(dignified)
An actor, sir.

Realizing this is a performance the man laughs.

MAN
Sure.

He goes to his pocket and hands Shake a dollar. Shake
removes his beat up hat and bows graciously.

BARTENDER
Hey!

Shake rises startled.

BARTENDER
What I tell you about buggin'
the customers? Ritchie, throw
this trash out.

Before Shake can escape, a huge black bouncer grabs him by
the collar and the seat of his pants and rushes him toward
the door.

SHAKE
You can't treat me like this,
it's a lousy, bad plan. I

Shake sits up, he looks at the dollar bill ripped in half.
His spirits sink. He hears a sound. He turns right. His
P.O.V. A bottle of scotch atop a small remote control toy
dump truck, turns from the alley and heads toward him. The
bottle comes right up to him. The truck flashes its little
lights twice, turns and heads back towards the alley. Shake
can't believe his eyes. He follows on his hands and knees.
The truck turns the corner, Shake follows getting closer and
closer until the truck goes between two legs and stops.
Shake's P.O.V. A stylized brass skull sheathed in a black
boot. Shake looks up and gulps. He stands, smiling weakly
at Castle who looks at Shake menacingly. The truck’s remote
control unit in his hand. Shake stands, obsequious.

SHAKE
Hi there. Nice weather we're
having for this time of year.

CASTLE
You were supposed to meet me
four hours ago.

SHAKE
(self-pitying)
I know, I know all about it.
Been hearing it all my life.
Shirks responsibility, can't

Castle steps within a hair's breath of Shake.

CASTLE
Almost everyone.

SHAKE
Right, just what I was about
to say. There are a select few...

CASTLE
I don't have all night. Where's

SHAKE
The dope, the dope. Oh that.

Castle fixes Shake with a hard stare, hands him the bottle
of scotch from the dump truck, and turns around to mount his
chopper.

SHAKE
But the location's not the
big story.

Castle turns.

SHAKE
Who'll be there is.

CASTLE
Who'll be there?

SHAKE
Everyone. They're all working

EXT. PIER THIRTY ~ NIGHT

There are two vans and four cars on the pier along with
several members of the "new mafia". All under thirty, a bit
anxious about each other and the situation. Equipped with
the latest communication and surveillance gear, they are
trying to be professional. Bill fiddles with a hand held
radio.

BILL

Tim takes it out of his hand and pushes the power button.
He hands it back condescending.

Very difficult.

Tim pushes Bill. Bill pulls a gun. Tarrone jumps in.

TARRONE
Hey, hey. We got five hundred

Everything's okay?

The young hood gives a perfunctory look out the windshield.
Tarrone's car drives by and heads-up the street.

Samurai sword thrusts through the windshield, through the

Through his squint, he only sees the outline of the Cutter

CUTTER CAPTAIN

We have to pull into dock, our
hull is leaking. Here take a
look.

The Cutter Captain steps forward. He is Japanese.

FRENCHMAN
Regardez-la.

He points to a spot above the water line. The Cutter
Captain looks down then up. The Frenchman smiles. The
Cutter Captain pulls out a pistol and shoots the smiling
Frenchman dead. The French crew is stunned, when three
thumps from behind startle them. Their startled P.O.V. The
three black garbed figures landing on the deck. The two
bigger ones spring into action, decimating the six crew men
with throwing stars, Okinawan hand sickles and their deadly
karate hands and feet. Their work is swift, brutal. They
are invincible.

ANGLE ON the wheel house. A Frenchman with a pistol
stealthily comes around the corner. He aims to fire when a
foot flies out and hits his wrist. His hand, pistol still
in it, is severed clean. His terrorized P.O.V. The
smallest figure in black slices with the other foot, kicking
him in the throat. When the foot comes away, a deep gash
spurts blood. The black figure takes a handkerchief out of
the man's pocket and wipes the side of the bloodied shoe
clean.

CLOSE UP a silver blade forms the side of the shoe. The
smallest black clad figure gives orders with hand signals to
the other two who, unmasked, are shown to be Japanese. On
cue, the Coast Guardsmen come out of the shadows, pouring
onto the French boat. They too are Japanese. They begin to
dress themselves in the hats and coats of the dead
Frenchmen, tossing the bodies overboard. At a signal from
the smallest, the three black clad figures disappear over
the side of the boat.

EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF

Castle comes across the roof in a crouch, an auto shotgun
slung over his back, a steel cross bow with a brace of black
arrows in his hand. A length of nylon cord hanging from his
belt. His P.O.V. on the pier. The trawler pulling to
dockside. The vans are backed up and open ready to be
loaded. All the Mafiosi face the trawler, their backs to
the warehouse. Castle loads an arrow in his cross bow and
hooks the nylon cord through a loop in the back. He raises
the bow and takes aim when something catches his eye. Three
black clad figures rise from the water onto the pier and
sneak up on the unsuspecting Mafiosi. Castle lowers his
cross bow and watches.

CUT TO:

EXT. PIER THIRTY
Bill steps up to the trawler, flanked by two other men.

BILL
You're fifteen minutes late

A knife hits him in the back, he spins around, stares
bugeeyed and falls at the startled feet of his companions
who pull their guns and turn to the three black figures.
Before they can fire, they are subdued. The tall black
figure neatly slices one man's head open with a sickle

attached to a long chain. The stout black figure throws
two, three—pronged sai which catch another Mafioso high and
low simultaneously. The third is dispatched by the smallest
figure, who with a flick of the wrist sends a stiletto—thin
blade through the man's throat. The Japanese on the boat
jump off and begin to unload crates of heroin into the vans.

ANGLE ON Castle. Watching. Perplexed. He hears the
faintest noise from behind and rolls to his right, swinging
his shotgun around as a spray of silencer bullets fired from
an uzi hits where his head had been. He lets go a blast,
wasting the Japanese assassin who had snuck up behind him.

ANGLE ON the Japanese loading on the pier. Looking up as
the blast sounds. An arrow whistles through the night and
pierces one of the Japanese with such force, it pins his
body to the side of the van. A nylon cord extends from the
arrow to the opposite warehouse. A figure comes sliding
down the cord. It's Castle. He scatters the Japanese, as
he rushes towards them, with a deadly spray of uzi fire.
Castle hits the ground right in front of the pierced
Japanese. He yanks the body off the van.

CASTLE
Let's stick together.

He uses the body as a shield. Not a moment too soon. The
Japanese recover and start to fire their weapons, riddling
their dead companion's body. Castle opens the van door,
yanks the parking brake, and pushes the van towards the end
of the dock. As it goes over into the water, Castle sprints
for the safety of the wharf building. The Japanese charge.
Castle blasts two, three dead.

ANGLE ON the three black clad figures. The smallest
hand-signals to the other two. They split up, disappearing
into the shadows.

CUT TO:

CASTLE BEHIND A PILLAR

Reloading his shotgun, he looks up. The tallest black
figure springs out and throws his sickle and chain. Castle
raises his shotgun and catches the sickle's deadly blade.

He twists down blowing the chain apart and blasts again at
this attacker. The black figure dives into the shadows.
Castle hears an engine start up. His P.O.V. The second
van, loaded with heroin, is leaving the pier. Castle runs
at an angle trying to cut it off, blasting two more wouldube
assassins to early graves who get in his way. Out of
nowhere a sai is thrown, hitting Castle's shotgun out of his
hands. The stout, black figure charges with two sai raised.

39.

Castle ducks behind a pillar as a sai aimed for his head
hits. He ducks behind a second pillar as another crashes
into it. He grabs a block and tackle with a rotting netting
and swings it, entangling his assailant. The van is almost
past him. Castle scoops up his shotgun, slipping it over
his shoulder. He sprints, bullets grazing left and right.
He is on a collision course for the van. He whips a knife
out of his boot and leaps.

CLOSE UP

INT. VAN

Castle‘s fist crashes through the window. His knife imbeds
in the driver's chest.

ANGLE ON Castle hanging on through the window, steering as
best he can. The van veers towards the end of the pier. A
moment before it plunges into the brine, Castle jumps off.
He somersaults and comes up running, shotgun blasting away.
Another three Japanese assassins fall. Castle‘s P.O.V. in
slow motion. The smallest black figure steps out some ten
yards in front of him. Castle raises the shotgun to fire.
The black figure is faster. A flick of the wrist sends a
deadly stiletto slamming into Castle's shoulder. The
shotgun flies up shooting skywards. Castle falls back
clutching his shoulder and plunges into the dark water
below. Four Japanese with uzis rake the water with lead.
when they finish, the three black clad figures step forward
and peer into the still water below. Nothing surfaces,
neither body nor bubbles. After a moment, all the Japanese
leave except the smallest black figure, who still masked,
peers into the water a moment longer.

Castle sits, his shirt off, his body drenched in sweat. The

He steels himself, grabs the hilt of the stiletto and pulls.
His body shivers as the long blade comes out. The wound

TANAKA
No thank you. What I have to say

tracking your organizations for
quite some time. Your leadership
has been decimated. Your soldiers
are inexperienced. Our little

ample proof of that. You are

get to the heart of the matter.
What do you want?

Deleo towers over Tanaka. He stabs his finger in her face
as he talks. She listens calmly and then grabs his bear—paw
of a hand and twists. Deleo falls to his knees grimacing in
pain.

TANAKA
We are Yakuza. When your ancestors
were still shepherds screwing sheep,
ours were the crime lords of Asia.

She looks up to Franco still holding onto Delec‘s hand.

TANAKA
I am not offering terms, Mr. Franco,
I am making demands.

FRANCO
And what if we choose not to comply?

TANAKA
Steps are now being taken to ensure
that you will. You Americans have
a great capacity for violence.

She looks down at the still grimacing Deleo.

TANAKA
But it is wild, unfocused. You
will learn.

Her eyes glint cold. She squeezes hard, breaking Deleo's
wrist. He screams and drops to the floor in agony.

story about our Miss Tanaka. The
only person she was ever close to
was her twin brother. They grew
up in an orphanage in Tokyo after
the war. They were inseparable,
lived together their whole lives.
One day he stuck the Yakuza for
a lot of money, which he had no
intention of paying back. Nothing

Then other people started getting
the same idea. Before she was
allowed to become head of the

demanded an act of absolute
loyalty. So you know what she
did? She went home, cooked her
brother a beautiful meal. Waited

Shake descends into the sewer. He reaches the bottom and
lights a match.

SHAKE
Hello. Hello. Come out, come
out wherever you are.

The match goes out. Shake lights another. A rat scurries
across his foot. He yelps, dropping the match plunging
himself into darkness.

SHAKE
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble,
I'd better get out of here on
the double.

He lights another match, jumping back. Castle stands in
front of him, his mouth drawn in a tight line. Shake
screams, startled. Castle hits a switch on the wall. Dim
maintenance lights come one.

SHAKE
You know with your flair for
entrances you should consider
a career in theater.

CASTLE
I'll put it on my list of things
to do. What are you doing
here?

SHAKE
What would I be doing tramping
around the sewers of this great
metropolis?

CASTLE
Sightseeing.

SHAKE
Very funny. I bring you news,
you give me grief. You know
they all think you're dead.

CASTLE
Then let's not do anything to
change their minds. Turn off
the lights when you leave.

Castle turns and walks towards his motorcycle parked in the
shadows.

SHAKE
But, there's more.

CASTLE
Not for me. They'll kill each
other now.

SHAKE
And what will you do while the
carnage ensues?

Castle mounts his bike.

CASTLE
Maybe take a vacation.

SHAKE
Yes, I hear the sewers of Paris
are lovely this time of year.

Castle hits the starter on his bike.

SHAKE
And what about the children?

Castle stops abruptly at the mention of the word.

CASTLE
what children?

SHAKE
The children of the new bosses,
snatched out of thin air by
the Japanese. If their fathers
don't make a deal, the world
will not see their like again.

CASTLE -
Why are you telling me this?

SHAKE
Because you punish the guilty,
not the innocent.

Castle reaches into his saddle bag and pulls out a bottle of
liquor and hands it to Shake. Shake refuses.

INT. ELEVATOR

Sato and Tomio, carrying a suitcase, and several other
passengers watch the elevator go up. 38, 39, 40. The last
floor. Everyone gets out except for Sato and Tomio. The
doors close. Sato takes out a key and inserts it into a
slot. The elevator starts up again to an unnumbered floor.
The elevator stops and the doors slide open to a large,
traditional Japanese Martial Arts School, where dozens of
Yakuza soldiers are training. They all stop on cue as Sato
and Tomio exit and bow in unison. Sato and Tomio bow back
and then stride through the hall and out. The Yakuza return
to their practice.

CUT TO:

SATO AND TOMIO

Striding through a museum room of antique Japanese weapons
and suits of armor and down a shogi screened hallway. From
the door at the end of the hall comes the strains of a full
orchestra playing Beethoven, the piano solo begins played to
perfection. Sato and Tomio enter the room to Tanaka seated
at a concert piano. The orchestra is a tape played through
gigantic speakers. Tanaka's daughter turns the page of the
score. Tanaka finishes with a grand flourish. Tomion puts
the suitcase on the piano. Off to the side a stock ticker
tape hums away.

TANAKA
What's this?

Tomio snaps open the suitcase.

TOMIO

SATO

They have agreed to meet with

Tanaka closes the suitcase and pats it.

TANAKA
Luckily we do not.

Tomio removes the suitdase from the piano. He and Sato
kneel facing the piano. Tanaka nods to her daughter who
pushes the tape deck button. The concert begins. Tanaka
takes the piano solo grandly.

INT. ROOM

The mafia kids are huddled in the dim light, scared. Tommy
tries to break the wooden boards covering the windows. He
succeeds only to find metal shutters behind them. A little
girl begins to cry. Tommy comforts her.

TOMMY
Hey, don't cry. We're going
to be okay.

He gives her a candy from his pocket.

GIRL #2
We're not going to be okay.
It's 'cause of my father I'm

TOMMY
That's not true.

TOMMY

I don't know.

BOY
I do. We're being held for

rich gangsters.

TOMMY
Then why am I here? My father's
not a gangster.

BOY #2

father's the biggest gangster
and a coward. My dad said if
he didn't run away from his
responsibilities, there wouldn't
be this mess.

TOMMY
Bull shit:

BOY #1
You‘re bull shit.

Tommy jumps him. They start to fight. The door opens. Two
Yakuza break them up and hold them apart.

YAKUZA
No fight.

Tommy struggles.

TOMMY
Let go! Get off!

YAKUZA
Quiett

A third Yakuza slaps Tommy across the face. Tommy stops
struggling. A moment later, Tanaka appears at the door
followed by her daughter. Everyone falls silent. A little
girl starts to cry. Lady Tanaka bends down smiling and with
a tissue handed to her by her daughter, wipes the child's
tears. Tanaka picks the girl up in her arms.

TANAKA
Why are you fighting? Everything
is going to be all right.

CHILD
I want to go home.

TANAKA
And you will.

TOMMY
When?

Tanaka caresses the child's face. She walks over to Tommy
and stares at him.

TANAKA
Very soon. Here.

She gives the little girl a candy to suck on.

TANAKA
No more tears now.

She kisses the little girl on her cheek, puts her down and
exits. Some of the kids are buoyant.

GIRLS
We're going home. We're
going home.

Tommy Sifts around through some rubble. He picks up a short
dowel, takes a piece of splintered wood and starts tying it
to the end of the pole making a short spear.

What are you doing?

TOMMY
You believe her?

The other boys watch Tommy for a moment and then start
foraging for weapon material.

INT. DEN OF INIQUITY

The room is smokey and full of the devil's work. In the
center are gaming tables surrounded by frenzied players.
Along the walls are dozens of slot machines. In two dark,
cave-like rooms, people smoke opium, prepped by ancient
Chinese men. In other side rooms, prostitutes do business.
In a cashier‘s booth two Japanese take care of the cash.
Four Japanese brutes walk the floor as bouncers. All at

flying down onto one of the crap tables. He has a large
weapon on his back with a thick cylinder attached. The two
bouncers move to grab him. One grabs for his foot. Castle
kicks his lights out. The other bouncer draws a gun.
Castle's knife is faster. The man falls. Castle lifts a
third bouncer to his face after wacking him with a sack
kick.

CASTLE
Where are the children?

The bouncer just stares at him.

CASTLE
Every day the children are
gone is gonna cost you. Take
that message to your people.

Castle removes the gun from his shoulder and begins to pump
explosive shells into the slot machines one after another.
People start running and screaming. Slot machine after slot
machine explodes, sending coins in the air. A Japanese
tries to run from the cashier's booth with a suitcase.
Castle pumps his shell into the suitcase. Cash flies
everywhere. Castle shoots the gaming tables. Chips go
flying. He shoots the bar. Liquor bottles burst. He
shoots the water pipes. Water sprays on everything. Castle
keeps pumping shell after shell after shell.

FADE TO:

THE AFTERMATH

The entire room reduced to soggy debris. Police are wading
through the destruction looking for clues. Suspects are
being led out. The two Japanese bouncers are being held
handcuffed. Berkowitz and Sam come down the stairs looking
around at the destruction. Berkowitz eyes the glum
Japanese.

BERKOWITZ
Who are these happy campers?

COP
I don't know, I can't get
a word out of them.
Sam looks at them.

SAM
Take your shirt off.

The man looks at her surprised.

55.

SAM
I said, take your shirt off.

BERKOWITZ
Sam, what the hell you doin'?

Sam grabs the man, without warning, by his shirt front and
yanks hard. His clothes pull away. Everyone's P.O.V. His
whole body is covered with tattoos.

COP
What the hell?

SAM
They're Japanese Yakuza.

BERKOWITZ
who did this?

He is about to get aggressive with the Japanese when his
beeper goes off.

SAM
I'll get it.

Sam hustles for the door.

COP
Lieutenant?

Berkowitz walks over. The cop points to the floor. His
P.O.V. in a puddle of water and his own blood, the third
bouncer. With Castle's skull knife sticking out of his
chest. Sam comes running over.

SAM
You're not going to believe
this.

His eyes lead hers to the corpse and the knife.

BERKOWITZ
Try me.

SAM
The kids of all the new family
heads have been snatched.
They've named the Punisher as
the prime suspect in the case.

Berkowitz starts to walk away.

BERKOWZTZ
They're wrong.

SAM
It makes sense.

BERKOWITZ
It does, but they're still
wrong.

Castle and Shake pull up across the street on Castle's
chopper. Castle has his auto shotgun slung over his back
and a .09mm pistol stuck in his waistband.

CASTLE
You're sure this is the
place?

SHAKE

I'd stake my reputation on
it. If I had one.

Castle dismounts and checks his shotgun and the pistol.

SHAKE
Got a spare?

CASTLE
If they're holding the kids,
it's with an arsenal. You
move left instead of right,
you're dead.

SHAKE
The critics said the same thing
about my Hamlet.

CASTLE
Stay here. I wouldn't want to
get a ticket.

He looks up at a No Parking sign and pats Shake's shoulder.

CASTLE
You've done your fair share.

Castle disappears into the shadows. Shake looks around a
little nervous. To calm himself and pass the time, he takes
out a pair of bifocals and a tattered copy of Backstage and
begins reading the classifieds. A black~gloved pair of arms
grabs Shake from behind and yanks him into the shadows.

CUT TO:

INT. LUMBER YARD

Castle stalks through the lumber yard, cautious in the eerie
silence. His senses keen and alert. A slight noise from
behind spins him, shotgun at the ready. There is nothing.
All of a sudden a brace of lumber from above him comes
sliding off a second story shelf. Castle dives up a small
aisle. The boards hit the aisle supports, breaking them.
More lumber starts to fall.

Castle rolls and runs, losing his shotgun, staying only a
few inches ahead of the avalanche of wood. Bullets begin to
spatter all around him and hell breaks loose. Castle turns
the corner. Two Yakuza jump out with automatic guns.

.Castle hits a board sticking out of the pile, it swings back
into the Yakuza knocking them over. Castle pulls a pistol
out of his belt and pops up another aisle. Shots drive him
back. He spins and fires up. A body falls from above.
Castle runs. A Yakuza jumps him from behind. He flips the
man over and smashes his chest with an elbow crushing his
sternum. As Castle is about to head for the exit another
blazing gun blocks his way. He sprints up another aisle.

58.

As he turns the corner, a hand grabs his arm. He is flung
into a sheaf of boards. Tomio kiais loudly and attacks with
a large punch. Castle ducks. The punch smashes through the
beam behind him, cracking it with awesome force. Tomio
charges again. Castle blocks his punch and is cracked with
a backhand so strong it sends him spinning. Tomio jumps up
and goes to stop Castle. Castle rolls out of the way at the
last moment, grabs a 2x4 and rises to face Tomio.

His P.o.v. To the left a board holding back a stock of
2x4's. Tomio charges. Castle swings knocking the board
away. The 2x4's fall on Tomio, burying him. Castle runs
for the exit and almost makes it, but Sato jumps out and
fires an uzi across his path. Castle takes off running
through the stacks of lumber, drawing fire from all sides.
He swings onto a hoist and takes off sailing over the fence
landing outside the yard. He slams the door as the Yakuza
charge, firing, and bolts it with a thick board.

He runs for his motorcycle across the street. Shake is
nowhere to be found. The Yakuza across the way pound on the
door. Castle mounts his chopper and takes off.

CLOSE UP a hand swings a chain with a grappling hook. The
hook flies through the air and lands in Castle's spokes.

The bike upends. Castle flies off into a bunch of empty
wooden crates. when he rises, the smallest black clad
figure is walking towards him, masked but for the eyes.
Castle’s hand imperceptively grabs a wooden dowel. Waiting,
feigning incapacity until the black clad figure is almost
upon him. He springs, swinging with the dowel. The Yakuza
grabs his arm and flips him over effortlessly. Castle rolls
out. The Yakuza attacks. Castle barely gets out of the
way. He grabs the Yakuza by the shoulder and goes to flip
him around but a wheel kick spins before he can, catching
him in the jaw. Stunned, another wheel kick drives him to
his knees. Castle attempts to get up. He is kicked again
and again. The other Yakuza come bursting out of the
warehouse. Castle's vision blurs as the Yakuza come running

up.

His assailant spins again, kicking him in the head. He
falls to his knees. His P.O.V. before he fades to
blackness. The Yakuza removes the mask. It is Tanaka's
daughter. A final wheel kick sends Castle spinning into
darkness.

FADE OUT.

Castle's vision clears. His P.O.V. as the haze lifts. He

overhead and darkness beyond. Sato, Tomio and Tanaka's
daughter look down at him. A moment later Tanaka comes into
View holding a remote control device in her hand.

TANAKA

That was a very expensive
question you asked in our
place the other night. It
cost us nearly two million
dollars in cash. How much
pain do you think that buys
you?

CASTLE
Is the question true or false
or multiple choice?

TANAKA
Neither.

She hits a button on the remote control device. The rack
creaks back, stretching Castle's every body fiber to the
breaking point. She releases the button, the machine
relaxes. Castle goes limp, panting with the pain.

TANAKA
Who sent you?

CASTLE
Nobody.

Tanaka hits the switch again. Castle screams in pain.

TANAKA
Do you get the impression
I don't believe you?

Castle looks her in the eye hard.

CASTLE
Do you think I give a shit?

She presses the button again for an even longer time.
Castle seems about to come apart at every seam. She takes
her finger off the button.

TANAKA
You handle your own pain very
well. Let‘s see how well you
handle the pain of others.

Sato forces Castle‘s head to the side. Castle's P.O.V. A
light goes on ten feet away. Shake is tied to a similar
rack. Tanaka hits the remote control. Shake screams with
pain. Castle flinches. Tanaka observes.

60.

CASTLE
He has nothing to do with it.

TANAKA
Then who does?

CASTLE
I already told you.

Tanaka sighs. A very sadistic looking man, ITO, steps
forward. Tanaka hands him the remote control device.

TANAKA
I have an appointment. You'll
be in good hands with Mr. Ito.
He can keep you alive much
.longer than you'll want to be.
I hope it won't come to that.
Good bye.

Tanaka exits with her escort, leaving Ito and two other
Yakuza in attendance. Ito addresses Castle in Japanese.
Then hits the switch on Shake. The old man is pulled beyond
endurance. Blood begins to trickle from his mouth. The
Yakuza go over and examine him with a stethoscope. They
laugh. Ito stretches him again, slapping him awake.

CLOSE UP
CASTLE'S WRISTS

As he works them back and forth against the rope that binds
his hands to the rack. His blood starts to flow,
lubricating the bonds. After a tortuous effort, Castle
slides mostly out of the rope.

CASTLE
Okay. Okay. No more.

The Yakuza turn around. The power is turned off Shake who
slumps unconscious.

CASTLE
Come here!

Ito addresses the other Japanese. The two of them stand on
either side of Castle, their jackets off, their shoulder
holsters in the open.

CASTLE
(whispered)
I got somethin' to say.

61.

Castle pretends to be close to expiration. The two Yakuza
bend forward.

ITO
What you have to say?

Castle whips his hands out from the bindings and pulls the
two pistols out of the shoulder holsters of the two startled
Yakuza. He crosses his hands left over right.

CASTLE
Sayonara!

He pulls the triggers and blows both Yakuza away. Ito goes
for his gun. Castle shoots him in the arm with one gun and
shoots the rope binding his feet with the other. Castle
hops off the rack and hoists Ito onto it, tying him down.

CASTLE
I don't want to stretch this
out so why don't you tell me
where the children are?

Ito curses him in Japanese, getting a little nervous about
the rack. Castle picks up the remote control. Ito eyes it
nervously, steeling himself. Castle pauses and then hits a
button. Ito screams. Castle's face goes hard.

CASTLE
I know you understand me. You
don‘t tell me where the children
are, I hit this button so hard
they'll find you in pieces like
chickens at the supermarket.

Ito spits at Castle.

CASTLE
Have it your way.

Castle holds his finger on the button so long that Ito's
muscles start coming away from his bones. His flesh starts
to rend.

ITO
Avenue A! Avenue A!

Castle releases the button. He goes over to Shake and takes
the old man off the rack, examining him. Shake regains
consciousness.

SHAKE
Go. Take care of the children.

At that moment all the patrons in the restaurant rise and
pull out silenced, automatic weapons and drill the
bodyguards dead. Then they turn their guns on the bosses.

DELEO
You fuckin' bitch!

Deleo pulls out his gun. Awkward, left handed. Tanaka's
daughter whips her wrists forward. Two knives seem to fly
out of her sleeves, pinning Deleo's arms to the wall behind
him. He screams in agony. The other bosses freeze. Tanaka
does not move.

TARRONE
Come on. What are you waitin'

TANAKA

She raises the poison glass. Deleo raises his head and
spits in her face. Tanaka‘s expression does not change.
She puts the glass down and calmly wipes her face.

TANAKA

out of the room, Tommy leading. He now has a gun. A Yakuza
in the hall stands to confront them. Tommy blows them away.

gun lying by a chair. In the confusion he grabs it and
fires it in the air. Everyone stops and turns. He points
the automatic weapon at the Yakuza.

TOMMY
Okay, let them got I said,

takes Castle's hand. The touch of her hand brings back a
flood of memories and he smiles.

CASTLE
Come on.

He leads them back into the room.

CUT TO:

EXT. BUILDING

Sato, growing impatient, calls into his hand set. He gets
no answer. He heads into the building.

CUT TO:

INT. ROOM

The kids almost all filed out through the window.

BOY

They looked Tommy in a closet.
CASTLE

Where?
BOY

Out in the hall.

Castle runs out into the hall and begins opening the
different doors with increasing urgency.

CUT TO:

INT. BUILDING

Sato comes bursting in. He orders two of the Yakuza to
follow him up the stairs.

CUT TO:

CASTLE

Opening door after door in a long hallway until he comes to
one that is locked. He takes his knife and bangs the lock
open. Tommy falls out. He squints. His eyes adjust to the
light. Tommy looks into Castle's eyes. There is something
that looks familiar. The same holds true for Castle.

Castle hears footsteps on the stairs. He grabs Tommy's hand
and starts to run back toward the room.

CUT TO:

SATO

Hearing the noise, he sprints ahead of his escort taking the
stairs three at a time and sees Castle and Tommy run into
the room. Sato jumps into the room. Castle with Tommy half

out the window, throws his knife. Sato ducks. The knife
slams the door shut revealing one of the little children
behind it, scared, sucking her thumb. Sato's eyes go to the
child. He leaps. Castle leaps at Sato catching him broad
side. They fight furiously. Tommy grabs the little girl
and passes her down just as Castle is about to be stabbed by
Sato. Tommy turns, makes a decision and jumps hitting
Sato's arm deflecting the knife. Castle rolls out but
before he can save Tommy, the other Yakuza burst in and fire
their weapons, driving Castle out the window. He jumps down
the fire escape hitting the bus roof and swinging inside
just as fire starts raking the roof.

CASTLE
Get down:

Bullets pepper the roof as Castle takes off.

CUT TO:

EXT. BUILDING

Sato comes running out shouting orders to the drivers of the
three gray vans. A dozen Yakuza pile in the vans and take
off.

CUT TO:

INT. BUS

Castle barrels the bus down the narrow back alleys.
Slamming anything that gets in his way; garbage cans,
debris. His P.O.V. between buildings on the street running
parallel to the alley. The gray vans in hot pursuit.
Castle sees the end of the alley. A gray van suddenly skids
in front, blocking his way. Yakuza jump out and start
firing their automatic weapons. Castle hits the
accelerator. His windshield shatters. The Yakuza jump out
of the way. One goes through the open windshield as Castle
blows into the van and turns left onto the street proper.
The kids scream as the Yakuza runs toward Castle, a gun in
his hand. Castle turns a corner sharply as the man reaches
him leveling his weapon. He opens the door and with one
foot kicks the man out. He turns back to the road.

His P.O.V. through the rear View mirror. Two vans in hot
pursuit. The rear windows are shattered by gunfire. Castle
turns onto another street. It is larger with oncoming
traffic. Cars fly onto the curb hitting posts, running into
buildings. One of the vans pulls up alongside the bus.

72.

Through the side mirror, Castle's P.O.V. A Yakuza has
jumped from the van grabbing the side of the bus. Castle
swerves trying to knock him off but the man hangs on, trying
to climb up through a window. Two girls jump up and sink
their teeth into his hands. The Yakuza falls off screaming.
The van pulls abreast of Castle. A Yakuza, in the driver's
side, points his weapon. Castle hits his brake. The van
shoots past, the shots missed. Now the van is in front of
the bus. Castle hits the accelerator and hangs into the
van.

ANGLE ON the van's driver growing nervous as he loses
control of the wheel. Gunmen inside try to open the rear
door but the bus has them blocked closed. Castle pushes the
van hard off the street, and into a building. The van
explodes.

Castle spots the third van, coming at him from the right.

He turns the wheel sharply onto an even wider boulevard.

The gray van tries to pull alongside. Sato appears with an
automatic weapon at the open door. Castle turns the bus
just as the gun fires. Police sirens start to sound in the
background. The gray van comes alongside again. Sato sets
to jump through the open bus doors. Castle looks at Sato as
he is about to jump then Sato looks forward. He sees
something which makes him change his mind. The van turns
off sharply onto a side street.

Castle turns his head forward. His P.O.V. Two dozen police
cars, their lights flashing, block the street. Cops are all
around, guns pointed.' Castle hits the brakes.

CASTLE
Hold on!

The bus goes plowing into the police cars. A fire hydrant
bursts. Street lamps topple. Cops scramble for safety.

The bus finally comes to a stop. The cops surround the bus,
guns pointed at the entrance. For a long moment nothing
happens. Then the bus doors open. A child appears, then
another and another until all the children are out. The
cops keep their guns trained on the door. A moment later,
Castle appears with a little girl in his arms. He looks at
the wall of guns and stunned faces. He lowers the little
girl to the ground and slowly raises his hands in the air.

CUT TO:

INT. JAIL CORRIDOR

Triple security is in effect. Armed guards with bullet
proof vests line the corridor. Footsteps sound, followed by

73.

the clanking of one steel door after another. Berkowitz
appears before the last steel door. It opens. He is
accompanied by two heavily armed guards. They stop before a
metal cell door guarded by two more armed men. Berkowitz
nods. The door is opened. The two guards prepare to enter
with Berkowitz. He waves them off, steels himself and
enters.

CUT TO:

INT. CELL

The door closes. Castle manacled from head to toe sits with
his back to the door. Emotion plays heavily across
Berkowitz's face. He composes himself and walks in front of
Castle.

BERKOWITZ
(warm)
Hello, Frank.

CASTLE
Hello, Jake.

There’s no emotion in Castle's voice.

BERKOWITZ
How you been?

CASTLE
Keeping busy.

BERKOWITZ
I know. I'm in charge of the
body count.
(sincere)
What the hell happened, Frank?

CASTLE
I woke up one morning and I
found myself dead, Jake.

BERKOWITZ
And so you decided everyone
else had to be too?

CASTLE
only the guilty ones.

BERKOWITZ
Courts decide who's guilty, not
cops. I've been after you five
years. You know that?

74.

CASTLE
I know that.

BERKOWITZ
Then why didn't you come to me
for help?

CASTLE'
I didn't need help.

BERKOWITZ
You don‘t realize it. You do.
You're sick, Frank.

CASTLE
No I'm not.

BERKOWITZ
No! What the hell do you call
a hundred twentymfive murders
in five years?

CASTLE
Work in progress.

Berkowitz loses his temper and grabs Castle by the shirt
pulling his face to within inches.

BERKOWITZ
They were my family too Frank,
remember? This is no fuckin'
joke. They're going to
electrocute you and there's
nothing I can do about it if
you don't help me, goddamn it!
Now stop it!

In his frustration, he shakes Castle. Castle looks at him
with dead eyes. Berkowitz realizes the futility of his
plea. ,

BERKOWITZ
What the fuck am I doing. You
wanna die? Die! I don't give
a fuck. My friend died five
years ago anyway.

Berkowitz hangs on the metal door. It opens. He turns once
more to Castle's back. Castle does not move. With a sigh
of great sadness, Berkowitz exits.

75.

CLOSE UP Castle's face. Stoned except for one small tear
forming in the corner of his eye.

CUT TO:

FRANK CASTLE‘S FACE

Warped by billowing heat as he moves through a column of
burning flames. In super~slow motion he moves forward. His
little girls are in the back seat, screaming, pounding at
the window of a car. Castle reaches back and punches the
glass, shattering the window. He reaches into the car for
the girls. His hands filling the frame. Castle pulls the
girls to his chest only they are no longer in the burning
wreck but in a bright, sun dappled, grassy field. He spins
them around and around laughing happily as Julie watches,
sitting on the grass nearby. Castle puts the little girls
down. Their mother beckons to them and they go running into
her arms.

CLOSE UP on Julie as she smiles at her husband. Castle
smiles back and starts to walk towards her when suddenly a
wall of flames shoots up in front of his family and then
another, then another, until they are completely obscured by
the fire. Castle screams at the top of his lungs.

CASTLE
No!

There is a tremendous, blinding explosion.

CUT TO:

INT. CELL

Castle jerks up from his cot, his body soaked with sweat.
His chest rises and falls like a marathon runner's. He is
shaken to his very soul.

The door from the jail opens. The guards shift to high
alert. Castle emerges, heavily manacled and walks the
twenty steps to the van. Before entering, he stops to look
around. Not finding who he's looking for, Castle enters the
van. The doors are slammed shut and locked. The garage
door opens. The van, with an escort of two police cars,
pulls out.

REPORTER

Castle, chained to the bench, stares at Sam sitting opposite
him.

CASTLE
where's Berkowitz?

SAM
Hurting. What happened
between you when he came
to see you?

CASTLE
What do you care?

SAM
I care.
(beat)
I'm his partner.

Castle registers surprise.
SAM

You surprised he had a partner?
Or he had me?

CASTLE
Both.

SAM

I was in the academy when the
two of you were making headlines.
Everyone needs a star to set
their course by. I chose you.
I studied every case you ever
made. Every bust and used what
I learned to make myself as
good as you.

for a long time by himself.
He needed help. You weren't
there. I was the next best
thing.

Now I'm the only thing. He
resigned from the force after
he saw you.

Castle turns his face away.

SAM

You know you’re killing him.
He lived for the day he found
you so he could help you.
That's all he had and now
you're taking that away.

(beat)
I can understand punishing
those you hate, but not those
you love.

Castle's jaw tightens uncharacteristically. He avoids Sam‘s

gaze.

INT. VAN

The driver and guard in the front of the van turn at the

truck has pulled out in front of them, seemingly out of
nowhere. They hit head on and both go through the
windshield.

CUT TO:

INT. VAN

Sam is thrown against the wall and knocked unconscious.
Castle rattled around but chained down looks around
confused. The van doors are blown off. Three masked men
with guns appear. _Sam gets up feebly going for her gun.
One man wacks her with his pistol. She goes out again. A
fourth man steps forward and points a pistol straight at
Castle's heart.

MAN
Nighty, night asshole!

He fires a dart into Castle's chest. Castle's vision blurs.
FADE IN

Castle’s vision clears. His P.O.V. Franco stands in front
of him in a dark, empty room underneath a single glaring
light. In the shadows beyond, Castle can make out the
outlines of armed men. He focuses on Franco.

FRANCO
Surprised?

Castle says nothing.

FRANCO
Okay, I'll do the talking.
Five years ago I left this
country with a six year old
boy. You met him at the
airport. I never wanted him
to know what I was or what I
did. I sent him to the best
private schools in Europe,
got him the best tutors. He

the darkness leaving Castle alone, unchained beneath the

glaring light.

smirking at Castle. Franco nods in agreement. He

approaches Castle, his face and voice mirrors of sincerity.

_ FRANCO

INT. TANAKA'S PRIVATE ROOM

Tanaka and her daughter dressed in traditional Japanese
kimono are doing Ikebana, the art of traditional flower

TANAKA
Ah, Tommy. I just wanted
to say good bye to you before
you left.

TOMMY

I‘m going home?

TANAKA
To your new home.

Tanaka pushes a button on a remote control. A large black
glass descends covering a whole wall. She pushes another

button. The black glass is backlit turning into a map of
the world with red lights dotting large parts of Asia and a
few coastal areas of the Western Hemisphere.

TANAKA
This is our empire.

She hits another button. Green lights dot throughout the
U.S. and Canada.

TANAKA
Soon this will be too and we
will need someone to run it.
Someone who feels like them
but thinks like us. I have
chosen that someone to be
you. You will be sent to
Japan, where your mind will
be trained, shaped, molded
until here.

She taps her head.

TANAKA

We will be the same. You
will have more riches than
your father ever dreamed
of. More power than he ever
knew existed. You will be
the first American Yakuza
overlord.

What do you think of that
for a future?

Tommy regards her for a moment. Then picks one of the
Ikebana vases and hurls it through the entire glass wall.
The map shatters. Tanaka's composure does not. She nods to
Sato who grabs Tommy and leads him away.

Franco climbs up rungs leading into a tube going into the
building. Castle pulls an explosive device from his pocket
and slaps it onto a thick electrical power box whose wires
run up into the building. He takes two beepers out, hands
one to Shake and clips one on his belt.

CASTLE
When the first signal light
goes on, throw the first
switch. Second signal light,

Castle presses the beeper on his belt.. The red light on
Shake's beeper flashes.

CASTLE
Wait for my signal.

Castle goes to climb up the rungs.

SHAKE
Sir?

He holds out his hand. Castle regards him for a moment and
takes his hand and shakes it.

SHAKE
Just in case. It's been an
honor to know you.

CASTLE
Likewise.

Castle hands Shake a pistol and one of his skull-topped
daggers.

CASTLE
Just in case.

Castle disappears. Shake sits down placing the gun and
dagger on one side and the beeper on the other. He takes
out a pair of bifocals, a tattered copy of Backstage out of
his pocket and turns to the classifieds.

INT. VENT

Castle and Franco peer out a vent opening at two Yakuza
guarding the elevators in the empty lobby. Franco takes out
his pistol, screws on a silencer and goes to take aim
through the vent. Castle stops him. He removes a skull
dagger from his boot sheath and undoes the four screws on
the vent then he taps on the vent until the noise catches
the Yakuza‘s attention.

FRANCO
(whispered)
What the hell are you doing?

One Yakuza guard comes over to the vent to investigate.
Castle holds his dagger poised. The Yakuza peers into the
vent. Castle thrusts the dagger into his throat.

CASTLE
Now!

Castle thrusts forward pushing the vent and the Yakuza out
of the way. The other Yakuza, caught by surprise, does not
even get a chance to raise his gun. Franco drills a bullet
through his heart before he can fire. Castle and Franco
jump out and head for the elevator. Franco takes a set of
keys off the dead Yakuza. Castle replaces the dagger in his
boot. The elevator doors open. Franco enters holding the
door.

Castle stoops and activates another plastic explosive charge
on a pillar by the elevator bank. He runs into the
elevator. The doors close.

practicing Iaido, the art of the sword. Each man has a live

seize their swords and charge. Castle and Franco spray the
hall with silenced uzi fire. The Yakuza go down like cut
wheat. As the two men jump out of the elevator, their guns
spitting death, one Yakuza lunges from the side. Castle
drills him, grabs his sword and sends it through another
charging Yakuza. In a moment all the Yakuza are dead.
Franco looks at two doors one on either side of the room.

FRANCO
which way?

A door on the left opens and two Yakuza appear, startled by
the carnage. They sound the alarm drawing their guns.

CASTLE
Not that one.

He fires off a burst dropping the two Yakuza. Castle and
Franco exit on the run through the opposite door. More
Yakuza appear and charge after them. Castle and Franco run
down the hall, Yakuza bullets coming closer. A shogi screen
door opens, a Yakuza charges out. Franco drops him with a
shot to the head.

grabs the dagger and with the point pushes the first switch,
the electric box some ten yards off explodes throwing Shake

Castle and Franco come running around a corner and reach a

also turn the corner. Suddenly the lights go out. In the
dark there is tremendous shouting, shooting and confusion.
A moment later the emergency lights go on. The hallway is
bathed in red light. The Yakuza look around. Castle and
Franco are gone. The Yakuza's confusion turns to terror as
deadly fire rips through the shogi screens to their left and
right. Castle and Franco empty their clips into the Yakuza
then kick out the remaining shogi and meet each other over

with antique weapons and suits of Japanese armor. As he
passes two suits of armor, they suddenly come alive. Castle
turns as two sickles flash out stripping him of his uzi and
slicing into his Kevlar. The helmets come off revealing
Tomio and Sato. Sato attacks with his sai. Castle grabs an
antique sword from another set of armor and blocks the sai
without an inch to spare. He counters, slashing at Sato's
armor. The breastplate falls away. Sato spins and throws
his third sai from his belt stripping Castle of his sword.
Castle kicks Sato sending him off balance and crashing
through a glass display. The glass slashes through his
entire exposed body.

Tomio attacks, a whirlwind with sickles. Castle back
paddles, throwing a kimono rack in Tomio‘s path. Tomio
slices right through it and keeps coming. He slashes as
Castle twists away. The sickles cut the straps of the
Kevlar suit and the beeper belt. With another quick move,
the sickle points catch the Kevlar and rip it from Castle's
body. Tomio flings the armor away and charges Castle.
Castle grabs a staff and tries to defend himself swinging at
Tomio's feet. Tomio jumps up and comes down splitting the
staff with his sickles and cutting Castle neatly across the-
face. Castle swings a large metal weapon which knocks
Tomio's sickles away. Tomio spins at the same time and
kicks Castle with a back kick. Castle doubles over. Tomio
knees him in the face. Castle falls back. Tomio spins
again kicking his head left, then right. He punches Castle
hard. Castle falls into a wall filled with weapons and
sinks to the floor.

Cut the crap: I want my boy!

TANAKA
Yes. I get that feeling.

FRANCO
Let him go. You got everything
you wanted.

TANAKA
Not quite yet.

Franco has walked past where Tanaka's daughter is
camouflaged into the white ceiling. She makes her way down
behind him onya short rope and prepares to throw a knife
into his back, when Castle comes diving through the shogi
tackling her into the next shogi wall. Franco turns to see
the two of them locked in deadly embrace. Tanaka escapes
with Tommy. Franco hesitates one moment and then runs after
his son, leaving Castle to face his fate.

Castle grasps the woman's wrists. She twists around and
under and flips him through the shogi. He rolls and rises.
She flicks her wrists, a knife barely misses Castle‘s face

91.

and embeds in a beam. Before Castle can recover, she
jump—kicks right at him. Castle barely has time to get out
of the way as her shoe sides rip across his face leaving a
long gash. Castle falls back as she kicks again. He lets
it go past and then grabs her and tries to flip her but she
reverses on him, punching him twice, hard, sending him
reeling. Again she attacks with her feet, but this time she
sweeps his feet out from under him. He lands on his back
hard. She lifts a heel. Castle's P.O.V. Two sharp spikes
coming right out of the heel like spurs. The spikes come
down an inch from his head with such force they stick into
the wooden floor. Castle locks her foot in place and pushes
her forward. She tumbles in slow motion, comes up and spins
with another knife in her hand cocking her arm to throw it.
She releases. At the same moment, Castle yanks her shoe out
of the floor and throws it. Her knife catches Castle in the
arm and pierces through. His shoe catches her square in the
chest. The side embedding in her heart like a hatchet. She
falls over dead. Castle yanks the knife out of his arm and
hobbles off.

CUT TO:

INT. LOBBY

The elevator comes. Berkowitz and a dozen cops in riot gear
pile in.

CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR

Franco runs down a corridor towards the two doors to
Tanaka's private quarters. He bursts through the doors and
stops cold in the doorway. Tanaka stands in the middle of
the room with a knife to Tommy's throat.

TANAKA
Not another step, Mr. Franco.

Franco goes to move forward. Tanaka draws a head of blood
from Tommy’s throat with her knife. Franco flinches and
stops.

FRANCO
You can't win here. You kill
him, I kill you.

TANAKA
And who loses more? Certainly
not me.

92.

Franco realizes what she says is true. His shoulders slump.
The gun goes to his side.

FRANCO
What do you want?

TANAKA
Get on your knees.

Franco hesitates. Tanaka pulls Tommy‘s hair back tighter
and puts the knife up against his throat. Franco complies
and gets to his knees.

TANAKA
Put the gun in your mouth.

Franco is stunned.
TANAKA
You have my word. He will
live.

Tommy tries to shake his head. Franco's conflict is huge.

FRANCO
How do I know you'll keep
it?

TANAKA

You don't. But some chance
is better than no chance.

After a long moment, Franco makes his decision. Slowly he
raises the gun to his mouth. He puts the barrel to his
lips.

TANAKA
All the way in.

Franco inserts the entire barrel into his mouth. Tommy
tries to turn his head away. Tanaka yanks it back forcing
him to watch.

TANAKA
This is part of your education.
Watch:
(beat)
Goodbye, Mr. Franco.

Franco tries to summon up the courage to pull the trigger,
When Castle lunges from behind through the doors pushing
Franco over and simultaneously flinging her daughter's knife
into Tanaka‘s forehead. As Castle falls to the floor, the

93.

knife in Tanaka's hand falls away from Tommy's throat. Her
eyes go blank. She topples backward. Tommy runs into
Franco's arms. They hug fiercely. Franco kisses his face
over and over. His P.O.V. Castle sitting up, propped
against Tanaka's concert piano. Franco's mind goes to work.

FRANCO
Tommy. Wait outside for a
minute. Mr. Castle and I
have to tie up some loose
ends.

TOMMY
Okay Dad.

Tommy walks towards the door. Franco approaches Castle.
Castle's P.O.V. Franco's hard vengeful eyes, the gun in his
hand. There is no doubt as to his intent. Castle sits
bleeding, battered, seemingly exhausted. He does not move.
A man awaiting his fate.

FRANCO
You helped me. Now I'm going
to help you,
(beat)

to the next world. Have a
nice trip. You son of a bitch.

Franco raises the gun. ANGLE ON Tommy turning at the door.

TOMMY
Dad! NO!

Franco keeps his eyes on Castle. His gun leveled.

FRANCO
Wait outside, son.

TOMMY
He saved you. He saved me.

FRANCO
You don't understand what
is involved. Now get outside!

TOMMY
I do understand. You are what
they said.

Franco turns angry.

FRANCO
(scolding)
I said wait...

94.

He never gets to finish the sentence for Castle has thrust a
skull dagger, from his boot, into Franco's gut. Franco
falls over dead, the dagger sticking up. Tommy is stunned.
He and Castle look at each other for a long moment. Tommy
throws himself on his father's body, sobbing. Castle gets
up slowly, painfully. He picks up Franco's gun, sticks it
in his waistband and starts to leave the room.

TOMMY
I'm going to kill you:

Castle stops in the doorway and turns slowly.

TOMMY
I don't care how long it
takes. when I'm old enough
I'm going to learn how to
use a gun and I'm going to
find you and I'm going to
kill you.

Castle takes Franco's gun out of his waistband and slowly
walks towards Tommy. The hate in Tommy's eyes is unabating.
His chest heaves with it. He doesn't back down. Castle
takes the gun, raises it, points it at Tommy.

CASTLE
It's easy to learn. There‘s
nothing to it. You flip the
safety, aim and pull the
trigger.

He points the gun at Tommy and then turns it around, lifts
Tommy's hand and puts it firmly on the handle. He gets down
on his knees and places the gun barrel between his eyes.

CASTLE
Do it! Get it over with now.
Maybe if you do, you won't
grow up and be like him.

A thousand emotions play across Tommy's face. He bites his
lip, tries to steel himself to the task, but he can't pull
the trigger. A sense of satisfaction, a hint of softness
fills Castle's eyes. He rises and looks down at Tommy
kindly. Tommy breaks down and begins_to sob. Castle puts
his arm around his shoulder. Tommy leans on him, sobbing
into his chest.

CUT TO:

95.

INT. HALL

The elevator door opens. Berkowitz and the other cops pile
out. The carnage stops them for a moment, then Berkowitz
starts running.

BERKOWITZ
Frank! Where are you? Frank!

CUT TO:

INT. TANAKA'S ROOM

Castle hears Berkowitz. He steps away from Tommy ready to
leave.

CASTLE
You're a good boy, Tommy.
Grow up and be a good man.

He takes two steps to the window and turns.

CASTLE
Because if not,
(pause)
I'll be waiting.

He fixes Tommy with a look a young boy will not forget for a
long time, if ever, and exits through the window. Tommy
stands beside his father's corpse numb. Berkowitz and the
cops burst into the room, their guns leveled. Berkowitz
looks at Tommy, then at Franco, then at Tommy again.

BERKOWITZ
what‘s your name?

TOMMY
Tommy Franco.

BERKOWITZ
The man who did this Tommy,
which way did he go?

Tommy looks at Berkowitz plainly and points at a door to the
left.

COP
Come on!

The cops run out. Berkowitz is about to follow them when he
sees a trail of blood leading to the open window. He looks
at Tommy once more, suspiciously, and heads for the window.

96.

He looks outside left, then right outside. There is nothing
but the night. His frustration builds. He bellows into the
night.

BERKOWITZ
Frank Castle! I'm here Frank.
Did you hear me? I'm here.
Frank! Fraaank!

ZOOM OUT as his plaintive cry reverberates through the night
shrouded city. ZOOM OUT to the stars twinkling in the
heavens.

CASTLE (V.O-)
I still talk to God sometimes.

I ask him if what I'm doing
is right or wrong.

The screen goes to black.

CASTLE (V.O.)
I'm still waiting for an answer.

THE END
