"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE"

FADE IN

FULL ESTABLISHING SHOT - S. S. POSEIDON - NIGHT 1

A huge passenger liner built in the 1930's to carry a thousand passengers.

She-rolls, in agony as she plows through piling seas.
EXT.. MEDITERRANEAN SEA -‘ NIGHT 2
Titles and credits appear over a series of shots- of the great ship as she

fights her- way through waves of staggering height churning with furious
force. Titles continue through-the. following:

ANOTHER ANGLE wPOSEIDON — NIGHT . I 3

Her bow dips , then rises as though trying to catch her breath, then dips
again, exposing her four screws above the surface of her stern.

EXT. SHIP --SHOOTING UP AT THE BOW - NIGHT , 4

Again, the bow dips,.a1most burying itself underwater, and in the wash
of tons of. water as it rises again, we catch the ship's name: POSEIDON.

ANOTHER ANGLE - S. S ..POSEIDON - DAWN 5

A breathtakingly beautiful, blinding sunrise is now the background to the
continuing battle of the old ship against the overwhelming sea.

- EXT. DECK AREA - S.-S. POSEIDON - DAY ' 6--

It's now early morning on the almost deserted upper deck. No more
than three or four hardy passengers are daring the elements . -A boy of .
ten moves in darting fashion with the roll of the sea. He is ROBIN
SHELBY, a passenger, an awesomely informed boy with sun-streaked
blond hair and a wiry little body hardened by growing up in the surf of
Manhattan Beach, California.

ANOTHER ANGLE - DECK AREA - APPROACH LADDER TO THE 7
BRIDGE - DAY I

With the determination of a young man who knows where he's going,. Robin
reaches the wooden ladder leading to the top deck. Full of vigor, he
moves up .

INT. BRIDGE OF'POSEIDON - DAY 8

In thisrhigh place, the full effect. of. the heavy swells canbe felt.
Through-the windows of the bridge. we can measure their height, against
the rise and fall of the horizon. The HELMSMAN clings to his helm,
aIUNIOR OFFICER holds on to a stanchion, the FIRST OFFICER steadies
himself at the engine room telegraph, and a RADAR'QUARTERMASTER
guards his set with difficulty. The CAPTAIN is. a tall man in his late
fifties , elegant-looking but strong . Another MAN , dressed in a business
suit, watches the crew narrowly, missing nothing.

CLOSE. SHOT - THE MAN . 9

He is-LINARCOSS. He has the look of an accountant-bookkeeper, sus-

- picious- and mistrusting .

seeing a huge swell approaching. He braces himself. The: ship raises
in breathtaking fashion, then drops, wallowing. The. Captain crosses
to the loudaphones , and speaks into one of them, not in panic-but in
irritation and frustration.

CAPTAIN
Engine room!
(after a heat)
This is the Captain. Is theChief
still there ?
(beat)
Put him on.

.INT..ENGINE ROOM - DAY 11

This is the heartbeat of the ship. As far as the eye can see, in every
direction, huge gears interlockedwith other huge gears respond to the
power released by the generators . They groan with the agony of age
but the pulse of power is deafening. .AnAASSISTANT ENGINEER who is
at the loudaphone at the log desk, answers the Captain.

ASSISTANT ENGINEER
Aye, aye, sir.

He turns to a WIPER standing nearby and calls over:

ASSISTANT ENGINEER
The Chief’s working on the generator --
tell him the Captain wants him on the
phone.

'Robin enters the bridge. The gale-force wind and spray almost blows

him through the door. An OFFICER closes the door-shut as all hands
turn towards the boy.

Where did you come from?

ROBIN
(as though it‘s
no problem)
From my cabin, sir. You said come.

Remember?

Robin's obvious lack of fear serves as a catalyst among the tight-faced
duty—watch. The Captain looks around at his men, smiles s°lightly at
Robin. ‘

CAPTAIN
I must say,. Master Shelby, you
picked a particularly fascinating
moment to accept my invitation.
Those waves don't worry you?

ROBIN
I've surfed up to eighteen feet . . .

But these look more like thirty.

Thirty—five , matter of fact.

wretchedly seasick. She is LINDA ROGO, in her late twenties.

LINDA

The doctor opens his bag as though he's done it fifty-two thousand times
before and no surprises remain inside to startle him. He brings out a
bottle.

The doctor starts to close his bag. Rogo looks withoutunderstanding at
the. bottle, then reaches over, closes a big hand firmly around the doctor's
wrist. The doctor looks from his pinioned forearm up to the man's face.

ROGO
Hold it, hold it. You mean to tell
me we've been waiting all this time
for you to kiss her off with a couple
of pills-and some crap about staying

The nurse inserts the thermometer into Linda's mouth, feels her pulse.

You know, God's pretty busy. He's
got a long—term plan for humanity that
stretches far beyond our comprehension.
So it's not reasonable to expect Him to
concern Himself only with the individual.
The individual is important only to the
extent that he's a creative link between
the past and the future ~— in his children, '
or in the contribution he makes to humanity.
.Oh, that doesn't mean that God has forgotten
us. On the contrary he's given to each

, . gift ~— a part of Himself -- aspark from ‘ . -_ .
