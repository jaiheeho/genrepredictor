ESTABLISHING SHOT

EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING

We reveal a nondescript apartment complex in North Hellywood
California. It is not nice or ugly. It looks like every
other pleasant-looking apartment complex in the valley.

INT. APARTMENT - MORXING

ANDY STITZER, a boyish looking forty year old man, is asleep.
His clock_radio goes ofﬁ. it is playing oldies, which now
consists of rock ‘n' roll ﬁrom the mid eighties.

MUSEC U9: “Heat Of the Moment" by Asia.

Andy sits up in bed. Not happy, not unhappy, just another
day,

INT. LIVING ROOM ~ MORNING

Andy is doing his morning workout. He is doing bench
presses. He lifts an enormous amount of weight. His face is

very kind, and vulnerable, almost emotionless, but his body
is ripped.

On a book shelf Andy has an impressive array of action

figures and comic books, all in their original packaging.
None of his vintage toys have been opened.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Andy steps out of his apartment and unlocks his bicycle. Hi5
neighbors, JOE and SARA, in their mid—eighties, wave to him
as he pedals off.

EXT. STREET w MORNING

Andy. dressed in khaki slacks and a white dress Shirt. rides
his bicycle to work.

ESTABLISHING SHOT
EXT. CIRCUIT CITY w MORNING

Andy rides his bike into the parking lot of a miniwmall. The
mini—mall consists of a dozen stores on two stories.

2.

There is a Barnes and Noble book store, a Daily Grill
restaurant, a nail salon, a children's gym and a video store,
but the centerpiece is an enormous Circuit City.

INT. CIRCUIT CITY

Andy walks inside. He says hello to people as he heads

toward the stock room. Everyone politely says hello back but
it is clear he has no close relationships here.

He takes his place at a desk which is in an opening between
the showroom and the stock room. People come to him with

their receipts to get their items pulled from the stock room
and delivered to their cargo

INT. CURCUET CITY - LATER

Andy is stamping a female CUSTOMEE’S receipt. PUNJAB, an
Indian salesmanq is standing nearby.

PUNJAB
It has been an honor doing business
with you. Enjoy your new
television. Watch River Runs
Through It, it looks amazing on
this thing.

ANDY
Cal will you please help this woman
bring her stereo to her car.

CAL, a pudgy twenty two year~old white man walks out Of the
stock room.

CAL
(not meaning it)
I’d love to.

He picks up the customer‘s television and walks with the
woman to her car.

INT. CIRCUIT CITY

Andy is walking across the showroom floor, headed for the
bathroom. he is stopped by JAY, a tall, handsome 25 year-old
salesman, who is working a so yearwold black female customer.

JAY
Andy knows all about this stuff.
What is the main reason a flat’
Screen is better than a rear—
projection?

ANDY
The viewing angle is far better on
a flat—screen. Due to the liquid
crystal display, you can watch it
from any part of the room, and it’s
a much better resolution.

JAY
So sure, you’ll save a couple bucks
with rear—projection, but you have
more than two people over, they’re
gonna have to sit on your lap to
watch TV. But maybe you like that!

The woman laughs.

Andy keeps walking. A very attractive young woman steps in
his path. He looks terrified.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
Could you help me?

ANDY
No.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
But you work here.

ANDY
Year I'm not a salesman. I stamp
invoices.

ATTRACTEVE WOMAN
I just have a quick question about
CD players.

ANDY
(quickly)
Punjab or Abujay will be happy to
help you. They're very nice. I'm.
on a bathroom break.

DAVID; a young, shorter salesman quickly runs up to the
woman.

DAVID
May I heip you?

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
Are you Punjab?

Punjab walks over.

PUNJAB
I am Punjab. I am here to serve
you.
DAVID
I was talking to her.
PUNJAB
I am Punjab, I am here to serve

you.

Andy keeps walking. David and Punjab get into it.

INT. BATHROOM

Andy breathes deeply, recovering from the interaction with
this pretty woman.

ENT. CIRCUIT CITY — LATER

Andy is at his post. David, Jay, and Cal are a few feet
away, having a conversation.

CAL
What about Andy?

JAY
He doesn't have any money.

DAVID
Well, we can't play poker without
at least four guys.

JAY
Ali right. But he‘s gotta bring at
least 50 bucks, or it’s not worth
it.
(to Andy)
Hey Andy, are you busy tonight?

Andy is takes aback at the question. Although he’s friendll’
with them, they never invite him out to social engagements—

ANDY -
Do we have to break down the Sony
truck?

DAVID
No, we‘re gonna play poker. You
wanna play poker?

ANDY
Uh, yeah, sure, that'd be cool.

JAY
You know how to play?

ANDY
I play on—line.

DAVID
Well it’s just like that, except
with real people.

ANDY
(trying to be hip),
So, uh, where's this going down?

DAVID
My house. I'll get you the
address.

ANDY
Cool, very cool. Should I bring
some stogies? Some liquor?

DAVID
Could you stop off at Boston Market
and pick us up some chicken? Three
extra crispy, one original, two
with fries, and two with mashed
potatoes, extra gravy. Each one
with corn on the cob.

ANDY
Okay.

DAVID
I'm just fucking with you.

. ANDY
I know. You think E'll pick up you
losers chicken? I'll see you guys
at the game .,.. but do yOu need
food?

DAVID
No.

JAY
I hope he has money.

INT. DAVID’S APARTMENT m MIDNIGHT

The four are playing poker. Most of the chips are in front
of Andy, who is a little too dressed up for this event.

JAY
How much fuckin’ online poker do
you play?

ANDY

Just an hour or two a night. when
I'm not on Sims.

CUT TO:

INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT — LATER

DAVID
(throws down ONE chip)
Well, Andy, at least i feel like
I‘ve gotten to know you better,

since you spent the last three
hours fucking me in the ass.
They all laugh.

ANDY
(giggling)
E didn’t fuck you in the ass.
Guys, this has been fun. Give me a
call anytime, I'm wide open.

CAL
You know what a gentleman does
after he beats other gentleman? He
takes them out for liquor.

ANDY
I'm game.

JAY
E have to get out of here. I’m
meeting Ellen.

CAL
A little late night action.

DAVID
So you just go to her place at
night and bone her and leave? And
she has no problem with that?

JAY
No, she loves it.

DAVID
How come I can’t get one of those?

JAY
Do you really want me to explain it
to you? Because I will.

DAVID
Shut up.

JAY
This girl is the best. She will do
anything. There is no filter
between what she wants and doing
it. Everything is on the table.
She~is—game.

ANDY
Sign me up for that. I'm in!

CAL
I have got to get laid. It’s been
too long.

JAY
How long?

CAL
Like four months.

DAVID
Who was the last one?

CAL
Jill. She was awesome. She had
these huge titties. Oh, i used to
love to bite them. I didn’t even
want to have sex, I could bite
those titties all night.

DAVID
What happened to her?

CAL
She was an asshole. She was mean.
She was a miserable person, but I
so regret breaking up with her.

DAVID
Why did you break up with her?

CAL
I felt like we were in different
places in our lives.

JAY
Yeah, you were in this place where
you were having trouble getting a
job and she was in this place where
she hated your fat ass! '

CAL
Basically. I miss those titties.

ANDY
Titties are the best.

DAVID
I had this girlfriend, she love&
the fellatio. Anywhere we went,
she would want to do it‘

CAL
Why didn't you marry her?

DAVID
We went to see Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective. And she’s going for it,
and the guy who worked there saw
us, but he didn’t stop it, he just
watched. It was so gross. And then
i couldn’t finish‘..

JAY
Wait a second, was that Ace one or
Ace two?

DAVlD
It was the first one.

JAY
This story is over ten years old.
You don't have a sex story that
happened in this millennium.

DAVID
Fuck you.

CAL
That is lame.

ANDY
Ah, unbelievable. So lame.

DAVED
Then you give us a good sex story,
Andy.

Andy is stopped in his tracks.

ANDY
1 don't kiss and tell.

JAY
Come on, give us a good, dirty one.
The dirtiest thing you’ve ever

done.
ANDY

1 can’t. i’m a gentleman.
CAL

Give me a break. You're a freak.
I can tell.

DAVID
Lay one 01’). US.

ANDY
(after a breath)
Ok...well....1 went with this girl,

she loved having sex. She was so
into it. We would have sex and
she’d be screaming, “I love it.”

It was so dirty. We had sex in
every room in the house. The
bathroom. It was like you guys were
saying. She wanted to do it on the
kitchen table. I came home and she
was on the kitchen table naked
‘cause she just wanted me to nail
her...

DAVID
And did you nail her?

lO.

ANDY
I nailed her so bad. We were
swinging from the chandelier. She
was crazy. It was never enough
with her. Never enough.

JAY
What was her name?

ANDY
Tanwdra. Man it was so Crazy.

CAL
Sounds crazy.

ANDY
I am embarrassed to even talk about
it. God, I was really into it,
too. It was so much fun.

DAVID
Did you like to talk during sex?

ANDY
She was talking the whole time. I
was hitting it big time. Just '
hitting it. She could barely walk
the next day. Me so horny.

They all laugh, and look at each other, realizing Andy is
full of shit.

JAY
So you really used to do her?

ANDY
Oh, I did her so bad.

JAY
What were her tits like?

ANDY
They were good. Good tits.

CAL
Her nipples?

ANDY
Yeah. Nipples.

DAVID
What were they like?

ll.

ANDY
They were good ones.

JAY
Give us some details. Were they
long nips? Flat hips? Dark
areolas? Were they big silver
dollar hips?

ANDY
They were like a dollar. Like ten
dollars.
DAVID
What?
CAL
Huh?
ANDY

Like ten times a night.

DAVID
Ten times.

ANDY
Maybe twenty.

JAY
Do you last a long time?

ANDY
Oh yeah.

CAL
How long?

ANDY
An hour.

DAVID

Of screwing.

ANDY
Yeah. Sometimes a little less.
JAY
So ten times would take at least
ten hours. Do you rest in between?
ANDY

No. E don't need to.

12.
DAVID
-You start right up.

ANDY
why not. Why waste time?

CAL
So sex with you could take a whole
day.

ANDY
Yeah. More even.

DAVID

Do you use protection?

ANDY
Sometimes. I don’t really need to.

CAL
Do you use a rubber, or a sponge?

ANDY
I always use a soonge. Sometimes
two at a time. What do you guys

use?
ALL
Sponge.
JAY
Did you get a lot of back door
action?
DAVID

Come on. that‘s enough.

ANDY
That’s cool. We did back door.
Side door. We were doing all the

doors.
(joking}
And a couple of windows.
JAY
You have no idea what we're talking
about.
ANDY

Sure I do.

l3.

JAY
(laughing)
Oh my God.

ANDY
What?

JAY
You’re a fucking virgin.

ANDY
What? Shut up. Yeah, okay. Tell
Tandra that. If I’m a virgin
Tandra's a virgin, too.

JAY
You are.

ANDY
Not since I was ten, my friend.

JAY
Unbelievable.

ANDY
Ha. That's funny. This is fun.
When did you guys lose your
virginity?

JAY
No, no, no. You've never popped
your cherry.

DAVID
Leave him alone.

JAY
What?

DAVID
Don't be mean.

JAY
I’m not being mean. He‘s a virgin.
I want to help him. I want to get
him laid.

CAL
Yes. Let’s get Andy laid.

ANDY
Come on guys. Very funny.

14.

JAY
I am gonna make it my mission to
get you laid.

DAVID
Be cool.

JAY
I am gonna be Andy's best friend.
I‘m Andy’s pimp. We‘re gonna
change your life.

CUT TO:

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT

He is pacing around furiously. It looks like he is talking
to his unwrapped action figures.

ANDY
They know, they know, they know.
They'll forget by tomorrow. They
were just screwing around.
_ (beat)
Oh no! Dammit. Oh no. Oh no.

INT. CIRCUIT CITY » NEXT DAY

Andy walks in, hoping nobody remembers.

ANDY
Good morning. David.

DAVID
Morning, Andy.

ANDY
Good morning, Cal.

CAL
Good morning.

He sees Jay. Oh no.

ANDY
Jay.

JAY
Morning, Andy.

15.

Andy smiles. They forgot. It is in the past. Haziz walks
up to Andy.

ANDY
Morning, Haziz.

HAZIZ
We’ve got to get you some pussy.
(turns to female salesman)
This boy needs to get laid.

ANDY
Good morning, Debra.

Andy runs to the stockroom, and Closes the door, and breathes
deeply, almost hyperventilating. Jay walks in.

JAY
Tonight, after work, you’re coming
out with us. And it's gonna
happen.
He exits. Andy is white as a ghost.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET v DAY

Andy is running down the street at full speed. We see David
is chasing him. He finally catches up to him on the median
strip of ventura Blvd.

DAVID
Andy, stop. Just talk to me.
You're gonna get killed out here.

They sit on the center divider.

ANDY
I don't want to go out with you
guys.

DAVID
Just relax, you don't have to do
anything.

ANDY

I'm busy tonight. I have plans.

DAVID
You don't have to go out with us
tonight if you don't want to.

16.

ANDY
I’m forty years old, you can’t tell
me what to do.

DAVID
Andy. Just relax.

ANDY
This is bullshit. This is total
bullshit, man.

DAVID
I’m sorry.

ANDY
You've invaded my privacy. This
isn‘t funny. It's my life. I'm
fine. My life is fine.

DAVID
Okay. It's fine. We just thought,
maybe you needed a little push.

ANDY
I don't need a push. You ever
think that some people find sex
sacred? It’s not a game. This is
a choice.

DAVID
To be a virgin. l'm sorry. I
didn't realize you were so
religious.

ANDY

Well, I am. Okay I'm not. But
it’s my own personal choice.

DAVED
Okay, but why would you make that
Choice?

Andy starts crying, his is mouth open in a silent scream. EUU
no noise come out.

DAVID
Breathe Andy, breathe.

ANDY
There’s more to life than sex. I
don't need sex. Why is that so
important to everyone? What's the
big deal?

17.

DAVID
If you’re happy with the way your
'life is, then fine, but you have to
ask yourself, are you happy? Don’t
you ever wonder if there's
something more out there?

ANDY
I lead a pretty full life.

QUICK FLASBES OF ANDY'S LIFE

7—Working out

——Euying action figures

-—Building an elaborate model

w~~Going to sleep. The clock says 9:15 PM.
BACK TO SCENE

ANDY
What am I missing?

DAVID
I don’t know. You‘re not just
missing out on sex, you’re missing
out on relationships. How often do
you even leave your apartment?
What about friends and love and
taking chances? And most of all,
you’re missing out on sex. What
are you crazy, that's the best
thing on earth. You can't live
your entire life and not experience
that. Hiding from that is shutting'
you down from everything else.

ANDY
You know, we've been working
together for three years, and I
think this is the first time we've
ever had a conversation that lasted
longer than fifteen seconds.

DAVID

See, good things are happening
already.

Id

ANDY
So what can I do?

DAVID
Come out with us tonight. No
pressure. We‘ll just have some
fun.

ANDY

I don’t want to have sex with
anyone tonight.

DAVID
Don’t worry. You won’t have sex
with anyone tonight.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Andy is walking home. Everything he sees seams sexual. It
is as if he has seen all of this for his entire life but
never noticed it before.

He sees-—

A normal looking middle aged WOMAN walking down the streetf
He looks away as if she is pure sex.

A gorgeous eighteen year old GIRL with no bra and a low cut T-
shirt.

Be turns away and tries to hide at a newsstand. He looks
down.

QUICK CUTS——every cover is of a gorgeous, busty woman.

He walks away and stops at a bus stop, just wanting to get
home. The bus pulls up and on the side of it is a billboard
of a perfume ad with a naked man and a naked woman. We only
see their bodies, no faces. It could not be dirtier.

Andy panics and starts running down the street. As he runs
the bus pulls out and is driving at the same rate of speed as
Andy. He can not escape this dirty billboard no matter how
fast he runs. Finally the bus stops at the next light and he
loses it, but immediately a new bus drives parallel to hini
with an even dirtier billboard of a couple, bodies naked and
intertwined, clearly doing something he’s never done.

Andy cuts right and starts running through a neighborhood-
He cuts through houses and lawns. He sees two DOGS havinél
furious sex on a lawn. Be cuts into the woods and runs arﬁi
runs.

19.

INT. ANDY’S APARTMENT

Andy runs in and closes the door. He lies down on his bed and
turns on the TV. as channel surfs. Every commercial and
program has something filthy on it.

—A soap opera with people kissing.
-A commercial for Viagra.
~Paris Hilton almost naked on Entertainment Tonight.

—Teenagers making out on MTV.

—A dirty rap video with tons of barely dressed women and a
ripped rapper.

He shuts the TV and closes his eyes as tightly as humanly
possible.

Suddenly we hear the sounds of his elderly neighbors
laughing, then having very loud sex. The wall behind Andy

bangs and shakes. Then stops. Then bangs and shakes even
louder.

Andy runs into the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS

Andy turns on the water, flushes the toilet, puts his fingers
in his ears and closes his eyes.

ANDY
(to himself.)
Everything's gonna be ok.
Everything is gonna be ok.

INT. EAR - NIGHT

Jay, David, and Cal are talking to an overdressed Andy.

JAY

David told me to be sensitive, so I

am going to be sensitive with you.

It is important that you lose your

virginity, you are forty years old.

Enough is enough. This is a hump

you just need to get over. Are you

ready to try?

20.

ANDY
David said I éidn't have to have
sex tonight.

JAY
David wee wrong. You do.

DAVID
Come on, Jay.

ANDY
Tonight? No.

JAY
Yes, tonight. What’s the
difference between tonight and any
other night?

ANDY
Ok, I‘ll try, but...

CAL
It’s easy. Just do what I do.
Only hit on drunk chicks.

ANDY
I can't take advantage of someone
when they're drunk.

CAL
It's not taking advantage of them.
People drink so that they have an
excuse to do the things they really
want to do.

DAVID
That's why I drink...and smoke
pot...

ANDY
I don‘t know. This doesn’t feel
right.

JAY

Yes, you do know. You've got to
get this behind you. And it all
starts now.

CUT TO:

o '
INT. BAR - LATER
Andy, Jay, David and Cal are huddled. Jay hands Andy a beer.
JAY
Just walk up to a woman, but if

she’s not drunk, just move on.
It's not worth wasting your time.

Andy walks around the bar, scoping out women.

ANGLE ON

A table filled with pretty, young women.
WOMAN#1

'I just need to get laid tonight.
It’s as simple as that.

WOMAN#2
You've been working so hard at
work, you deserve to just have some
fun. You never do anything wild.

. WOMAN#1
‘ Tonight I'm going wild. The first
nice guy that even talks to me, I‘m

gonna take him home and rock his
world.

WOMAN#2
You go, girl.

Andy walks up to the table.

ANDY
Good evening, ladies.

LADIES
Good evening. Hi.

The other woman move off so Woman #1 can talk to Andy. ’TheY
give her the eye like “this is the one."

ANDY
How are you doing tonight?

WOMAN#1
Great. And you?

22.

ANDY
Never better. Can I buy you a few
drinks?

WOMAN$1

I'm not really much of a drinker.
But why don't you sit down?

ANDY
No thanks. It was nice to meet you
though. Have a good night.

He walks away. She doesn't understand what just happﬁned-

ANDY
(to David)

She wasn’t drunk. Man, this is
gonna be hard.

CUT TO:

INT. BAR * LATER
CLOSE UP: ANDY

ANDY
I like what I do, I just don't know
if managing a stock room is what I
dreamed of doing when i was in high
school.

We pull out and reveal that he is talking to a DRUNK WOMAN
who is passed out, face down on the bar.

David walks over.

DAVID
(looks at the girl)
That’s drunk.

ANDY
Oh, ok.

DAVID
Come hang out with us. We’re
partying with these girls who are
having a bachelorette party.

ANDY
Are men allowed at those?

23.

DAVID
Shut up. Come on.

As Andy walks away, he turns to the drunk woman.

ANDY
It was nice talking to you. Have a
good night.

INT. EAR - LATER

The guys are hanging out with eight drunk women, who are
throwing their friend JILL e bachelorette party. The table

is littered with empty glasses and filthy adult novelty
items.

Jay is playing with one of the vibrators. He talks into it
like it is a phone.

JAY
Mr. President. We have a situation
in the erection room.

Everyone is laughing hysterically. Cal has edible underwear
on his face and he is eating through it.

CAL
It tastes like chicken.

They are laughing so hard, as only drunken people can laugh
at semi-humorous jokes.

DAVID 7
This guy will eat underwear that's
not even edible.

They laugh. Andy puts a huge fake penis on his head. trying
to join in on the fun.

ANDY
Hey, look at me. I have a huge
penis on my head.

They give him a look and a little chuckle, then go back to
their business.

CUT TO:

24.

INT. EAR v LATER

It is a little quieter now. Everyone is a little drunk.
except Andy who holds the same beer which he has not taken a
sip out of. Andy is talking to a pretty blonde, NICKY-

NICKY
(drunk)
The guy Robin's marrying, Jimmy, is
such a good guy. I hated him for
two years cause he cheated on this
other friend of mine. But he’s
really changed. He's a good guy

now.

ANDY
That's good that she’s marrying a
good guy.

NECKY

She deserves it. We all do. We've
all been friends since we were six.
lsn’t that sick?

ANDY
That’s nice to have good friends
you've known for a long time.

NICKY
You have kind eyes.

ANDY
Thank you. You have—~

She kisses him hard on the mouth. Lots of tongue. When it
ends. Andy looks like he doesn't know where he is.

NICKY
This is getting lame. Let's get
out of here.

Before Andy can say anything, she pulls him up and is walking
him towards the exit. Andy looks back at his friendst who
are so excited that they are high fiving and giving him the
thumbs up.

EXT. BAR

ANDY and NICKY are getting into NICKY’S car.

25.

NICKY
Are you drunk?

ANDY
No, not really.

NICK
Blow into this.

NICKY holds up a rubber hose that is somehow attached to the
dashboard.

ANDY
(Not understanding.)
...Sure, OK.

ANDY blows into the rubber tube. NICKY puts the keys in the
ignition and starts the car.

NICKY
Thanks!

Off of ANDY’s confused look we cut to:

INT. CAR
NICKY is driving.

NICKY
{mid«oonversation)

..He‘s like. “You are such a B-I—T—
CwH," pardon my French, and I’m
like, “Shut up, you loser." “I hate
your guts.” “I hate your fucking
guts.” Pardon my French. You know
what I mean? God, I hate people who
are stupid assholes. They are such
assholes. You know?

ANDY
Yeah, I hate that. Ass...

NICKY
Who’s your name again?

NICKY is clearly drunk.

ANDY
Andy.

26.

NICKY '
Andy, let me tell you something.
Don't ever be named Dan. Because
Dan is a jerk name.

ANDY
Okay.

NICKY
E am Total Cereal. Dan is a bad
person name. Dan rhymes with man
and men jerk off, and he was a jerk
off. You know what I mean?

ANDY
I think so.

NICKY’S driving becomes increasingly erratic.

ANDY

(noticeably uncomfortable)
So where do you live?

NICKY
Not with jerk~o. No fuckin‘ way,
baby. I did my time. He's someone

else's problem now,..Do you think
I'm pretty?

She turns to ask the question and runs through a red light.
Two cars narrowly avoid a crash.

ANDY is'quickly appreciating the danger of this situation.

ANDY
(reaction to near miss)
Oh, God. Yes. Crap.

NICKY
Look at me. You're not looking at
me. Come on. Look at my face. Do
you think I am pretty?

NICKY is looking at ANDY. Her eyes don't even glance at the

road. ANDY's eyes are glued to the road, filled with abject
terror.

NICKY
(screaming)
LOOK AT ME!

27.

ANDY

(screaming)
YOU'RE PRETTY. YOU'RE SO PRETTY. I
WANT TO LIVE. -

NICKY
Thank you. You know if you men
would just offer up a nice
compliment like that every once in
a while, there would be no poverty.

ANDY looks puzzled.

NICKY
You‘re cute. Kiss my mouth.

ANDY doesn't move

NICKY
Get over here.

NICKY forcefully pulls him to her.

ANDY is now practically sitting on NICKY'S lap. He lOGkS ﬁOWH
the road, she looks at him.

NICKY
I like you. You're not a jag...

She pauses to vomit a little in her mouth.

NICKY
.Off.

NICKY kisses him.

ANDY
Maybe I should drive.

NICKY
(playfully)
You don't know where I live.

ANDY
You could tell me.

NICKY
Hey, that’s awfully forward of you.

NICKY begins tonguing ANDY'S ear.

28.

ANDY
(laughing)
That tickles!

ANDY is now trying to help NICKY steer the car.
She is giggling while tonguing, he alternates between
laughter and paralyzing fear as the car narrowly avoids
striking pedestrians, other cars, trees etc.
Finally, NICKY looks up.
NICKY
(casually)

Oh, this is me.

NICKY pulls the steering wheel hard and the car does a
complete 366 and comes screeching to a halt between two
barked cars, in front of a nondescript apartment building.

NICKY
We’re here.

NICKY looks deep into ANDY’S eyes.
NICKY
My Mom's staying over tonight, so
let’s just do it here.

NICKY starts to take off her shirt.

ANDY
Maybe I should be moseying home.

NICKY starts to cry. She then abruptly begins to laugh. Then
she vomits on ANDY.

NICKY
I am so sorry. I think I ate some
bad shellfish sandwich.
NICKY continues to take off her clothes and kiss Andy.

NICKY
Hurry up, then we can get
breakfast.

ANDY is clearly repulsed and traumatized.

ANDY
I really need to get going.

We see that NICKY has vomit on her cheek.

29.

NICKY
0k, fine, your loss.

ANDY

I‘m just gonna go, I think. Thank
you. I had a really nice time.

NICKY
I’ll give you a lift.

NICKY puts the car in drive and smashes into the parked car
three feet in front. The second car hits a fire hydrant which

then blasts water through the open window of a nearby
apartment.

NICKY
Oh my God! I can't believe that I
smashed my neighbor’s car, and that
his car ran over the fire hydrant,
and that the fire hydrant ruined
the inside of that apartment...not

again. You have to switch places
with me.

ANDY
What?

NICKY
If this goes on my record, I'll
lose my licence, I won't be able to
get to work, I'll lose my job,

NICKY starts to cry again.

NICKY

Please...PLEASE! PLEASE... Mr. “Not
Dan Guy.”

In the distance, we hear sirens and see the glow of flashing
lights.

NICKY
Just change seats with me. Please,
“Not Dan Guy.”

ANDY
I don’t want to get into trouble.

NICKY
You won’t “Not Dan," you won’t. Do
you have a record?

30.

ANDY
NO...

NICKY
Then you'll be fine, believe me, I
know how this works. They’ll act
all serious and scary, and then
they’ll let you off with a warning.

(beat)
And don't act suspicious, there’s a
gun under your seat. It’s my ex's.

They quickly switch seats. A POLICE OFFICER leans his head
into the car.

ANDY
Good evening, Officer.

POLICE OFFICE
Everyone alright here?

NICKY
He was driving the car. He said he
was fine to drive.
(to Andy}
Liar!

Off of Andy's shocked look we...

CUT TO:

INT. HOLDING CELL a NIGHT

The cell is small and is packed with at least thirty hardcorew
looking criminals. We hear them cursing at each other. It
sounds like a gang fight is about to explode. The camera

pans across the faces and finally finds Andy, looking
terrified and slightly bruised.

IN?. CERCUIT CETY — MORNING

Andy is in a rage as he complains to David, Jay and Cal--who
can't stop laughing.

ANDY
It's not funny.

DAVID

If it wasn’t you, you would admit
it was funny.

3i.

ANDY
You know why it happened? Karma.
You don’t hit on drunk girls. It's
not right.

CAL
It’s so right.

ANDY
There’s got to be a better way that
works.

CAL
I haven't found it.

JAY
We didn‘t tell you to switch seats
with her when the cops came.

ARDY
I was trying to be a gentleman.

DAVID
Why did you even let her drive in
the first place?

ANDY
Because I wasn’t thinking straight.
You got me so revved up about
(whispers)
Having sex
(normal voice)
That I didn’t use my brain.

CAL
Sounds like you didn't use anything
else. Did anything eventful
happen?

ANDY
She threw up on me.

They explode with laughter.

ANDY
Keep laughing, because this is
over.

JAY

Easy. No it's not. We just need a
new approach.

32.

DAVID
How about...and I know this sounds
crazy..we set him up with girls
'that haven't been drinking heavily?

JAY
I don't know.

ANDY
Well I do. I want to meet a nice
girl. Maybe even someone I
actually like. I am not an animal.

I do not want to prey on people. I
want to find someone who will like
me for who I am.

JAY
First of all I think that’s a
mistake. But if that’s what you
want, then we are gonna have to
make some changes with you. Some
real changes.

MONTAGE OF ANDY GETTING A MAKEOVER

INT. HAIR SALON ~ DAY

Andy is getting a haircut. when he looks at his haircut, it
is meant to be short and a little European, but the coolness
of the haircut makes him look silly. The guys look at it and
smile.‘ Andy looks happy with it.

INT. HAIR WAXING STATION — DAY

Andy lays on his stomach on a table. A WOMAN pours hot wax
on his back, lets it dry for a moment, then RIPS it off ——
leaving a huge strip of whiter~thanuwhite skin in the middle
of his hairy back.

QUICK CUTS

*She strips ofi several more hunks of hair from his back and
chest.

*We see tears of pain coming down Andy's face. This could
not hurt more.

*Finally Andy, red faced and miserable, stops her as she is
about to pull off a huge strip.

He gets up and starts putting on his shirt. Only two thirds
of his body hair has been removed, and he looks insane.

JAY
You look good.

DAVID
Better than good. Oddly good.

JAY

Now you need to learn how to talk
to women.

ANDY
I get_nervous and I look up. I
never know what to say.

JAY
The key is, you don’t say anything.
Make them talk.

ANDY
How do you do that?

JAY
Just ask them questions. Girls
love talking. Let them.

ANDY
What if they ask me a question?

JAY
Then answer their question with a
question.
DAVID

It makes you seem mysterious. You
talk too much about yourself, you
look needy. Put them on the spot.

34.

They walk by Brentano’s book store. There is a pretty BLORDE

in her mid—twenties putting books on a shelf.

JAY
Go give it a test run.

Andy hesitates. David pushes him. Andy relents.

INT. BRENTANO'S — CONT.

Andy walks inside and approaches the blonde woman.

She turns and sees Andy. He acts Very confident.

BETH
Can I help you?

ANDY
I don't know. Can you?

She smiles.

BETH
Are you looking for something?

ANDY
Is there something I should be
looking for?

She is instantly on the spot. For the first time,
actually has the upper hand.

BETH
We got a lot of great new books in.
It depends on what you like?

ANDY
What do you like?

BETH
Me? I don't know.

ANDY
Do you know?

BETH

EXT. MINI MALL — MOMENTS LATER

JAY
That was incredible.
ANDY
‘ It felt good, not having to talk
much.
DAVID

That's the key. Make them feel
weird so you don’t have to.

JAY
You like her?
ANDY
Yeah, hut...she can't be the one.
DAVID
Why not?
ANDY

‘Cause it will be bad with the
first one. What if I want
to...make her my girlfriend? She
won‘t do that if it's...terrible.

Hey. How did you know where I
lived?
DAVID

It's on the staff list at work.
What, you're not going to invite me
in?

Andy lets David in. David is carrying a plastic bag.

DAVID
I just came by because I was
thinking, it seems like you have
kind of shut yourself
down...sexually speaking, and I
wanted to help you open yourself up
again.

ANDY
~ I don’t know. I am not into that,

DAVID
What? No. Are you serious?

ANDY
What?

DAVID
What did you mean?

ANGLE ON ANDY AND DAVID

DAVID
.This has got to be working for you.
Do you feel the animal in you
coming back to life? Is the bear
waking up from his hibernation?

Andy can't handle it anymore. He takes the tape out and
hands it to Andy.

ANDY
I think you should go now. I am
getting very uncomfortable.

DAVED
Don’t act like I am the weird one.
This is how God created us. To be
horny. You are denying his wishes.

ANDY
I am not denying anything, I just
think you should go now.

DAVID
Andy. you are like all of these
action figures you collect.

38.

He pulls a GI Joe off of the wall. It is in its original
box.

DAVID
You are all sealed up, in the
original packaging. You've never
let your true self out.

David opens up the box. Andy squeals.

ANDY
You are not supposed to open that.

DAVID
Yes you are, so you can play with
it.

David pulls GI Joe’s pants down, revealing a smooth flat
crotch area.

DAVID
Don’t wind up like Joe here. You
stay in the box too long and your
dick falls off.

ANDY
He never had a dicks

David exits.

DAVID
You did. Once. What happened?

Andy closes the door on him. He paces around his house.
FLASHBACK

We see Andy as a TEENAGER. He lays on a bed as a gorgeous
young GIRL takes her top off and then jumps on him.

GIRL
I can’t believe you haven't done
this yet. You are gonna love it.

She stops and suddenly looks disappointed and a little
annoyed.

GIRL
Jesus Andy, what's the matter with
you?

39.

ANDY
Nothing, I just got excited. Wait,
it'll happen again.

GIRL
Not with me. I am not gonna have
sex with someone who is done before
I take my shirt off.

ANDY
I’m sorry.

GIRL
You should be. I was gonna fuck
your brains out.

PRESENT DAY

Andy paces around. He realizes that David left some Of his

The sea scene with all the food plays out.

He smiles, totally relaxed and relieved.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

David is knocking on Andy’s door. The door opens and Andy is
standing there looking like he just had the greatest orgasm
of his life. His face looks completely relaxed, tie walks as

EXT. ALL STAR SPORTS BAR m §ARKZNG LOT

Andy, Jay,

Cal and David are walking irom their cars to the

restaurant. There is a huge banner hanging on the building
which says, “WELCOME SPEED DATERS."

ANDY
Speed dating? I don‘t know.

JAY
It's just like regular dating, but
you eliminate all of the fat. The
talking and the waiting for the
lights to come on to see if she's
good looking.

DAVID
You get two minutes with each girl.
You meet twenty girls in forty five
minutes. It would take you a year
to meet that many women.

CAL
More like a decade.

He laughs and lifts his.hand for a high five. Nobody high

fives him.

CAL
That wasn’t so bad.

ANDY
I'm scared. I don't do well under
pressure.

JAY
Just do what I told you to do. Ask
them questions. Put them on the
spot.

41.
JAY<cont'd)

You have a better chance of getting
them to like you if they are
feeling awkward and insecure about
themselves.

CAL
All I need is for one girl in
twenty to dig me. I can work with
these odds.

DAVID
When it’s over you tell them which
girls you like, they tell you if
any of those girls want to get to
know you better. And if there are
any matches you guys exchange phone
numbers. Or emails. I'm not sure.

ANDY
.Do you think this will work?

DAVID
Any girl who does this must be
desperate, so we are in luck.

ANDY

Don’t you have a girlfriend?

JAY
Not today.

Andy can barely talk he is so flustered from this experience.

That was...too much. Too fast.

Very fast. Didn’t like. I'm gonna
go home.

INT. CIRCUIT CITY ’ DAY
Jay walks over to Andy.

JAY
Come out to the floor.

Andy walks out on the floor. Cal and David are there. Also
standing there is the FLOOR MANAGER, 9AUL.

PAUL
Andy, I am short a man today, so I
need you to be a salesman this
afternoon.

ANDY
What? I am not a salesman.

PAUL
Nobody knows the equipment like
you. I have been thinking about
it, and I think your destiny is on
the floor.

The Indian salesman, Abooﬁay, walks over.

ABOOJAY
What?!! We need no salesman. I
sell. This is bullshit.

PAUL
This is not bullshit. And I
recommend you show some respect or
you will be selling...something
else...somewhere else.

49.

ANDY
He’s right. I haven't earned the
right.

PAUL

What are you talking about? You
have worked here longer than me.
Longer than anyone. It would be
fair if you were my boss.

ANDY
Thank you, but no thank you.

PAUL

(gets annoyed)
Andy, I am trying to get you laid.
The guys said you needed to get
women. There is no better singles
bar than that floor. It is a chick
magnet. So accept my kind
invitation before I rescind it.

ANDY
Thank you.
PAUL
Enjoy.
Paul walks away.
ANDY

Guys. I appreciate you doing this,
but I have to admit, I am really
scared. I am not good at talking
with women. It was hard enough
when they were drunk. And that
didn’t even turn out well.

DAVID
Come on. Fear the fear and do it
anyway.

ANDY

You are right.

JAY
The floor is hopping. Look, we've
got a gorgeous young blonds at nine
o’clock. A red head at twelve.

'And a brunette goth hotty at three.
Take your pick.

SO.

ABOOJAY
This is wrong. Very wrong.

CAL
Come on, he needs to be with a
woman.

ABOOJAY

I don’t care about that. Just
don't fuck with my customers. My
customers are my customers, not
your customers. You fuck with
them, I fuck with you.

Jay pushes him away as if he is five years old.

JAY
Aboojay, get the fuck out of here.
Go have a hamburger.
(to Andy)
Ready.

Andy takes a deep breath, node and heads out onto the floor.
He sees the GORGEOUS BLONDE. He walks toward her with a look
of determination. As he gets within five feet he etarte
walking faster, turns a corner and walks up to an OLE MAN.

ANDY
(to the old man)
Good afternoon. And how may I help

you?
OLD MAN
E am looking for a TV.
ANDY
Well, you are talking to the right

guy.
Jay, David and Cal watch with disappointment.
DAVID
when he’s done with him we’ll get
him to talk to a girl.

Andy is talking to the old man, only now he has several boxes
in front of him. Equipment Andy has sold him.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CIRCUIT CITY w AﬁOTHER HOUR LATER

Andy is walking with the old man to the stock room where Andy
takes his ticket.
ANDY
This man is getting a DVD player,
VCR, Tivo, surround sound speakers

and a flat screen television with
high definition capabilities.

OLD MAN
Thank you, young man. You are the
best salesman E have ever met. You
were such a help.

ANDY
You're sure you don’t need anything
else? Possibly a car stereo.

OLD MAN
Not today. But thank you. I'll be
back.

The old man walks oif. Andy looks relieved. Right then a
very pretty forty five year old WOMAN walks up to him-

WOMAN
Excuse me, can you help me?

Andy is flummoxed.

ANDY
Help? You? Uhm. I was about to
take my break.

It won’t take long.

Okay.

TRISH
Hi, I’m Trish.
ANDY
Andy...is my name.
CUT TO:

INT. CIRCUIT CITY - LATER

Andy is nervously helping Trish.

ANDY
You don't want this VCR.

TRISH
Really? I heard this was the best
one .

ANDY

It's not, really. VCR technology
is very simyle. Basically, no VCR
is that much better than another
VCR. The expensive ones don't give
you a better picture, they just
look cooler, and have more buttons
which you would never use.

Andy points out a standard looking VCR.

ANDY
This one has the features you need
and it is a third less than the
cool—looking one. Unless you
really want a cool-looking one.
Then you should get this one.
‘Cause it does look cool. It's
black. Has a lot of lights.

TRISH
Looks are not a factor.

ANDY

Great. Then we have found what you
need.

The old man that Andy was helping previously walks over to

OLD MAN
Excuse me. Is there anyone who can
help me set up what I bOught?

53.
OLD MAN(C0nt‘d)

I am not very technically minded.
And quite frankly, E can barely see
my own hand.

ANDY
Where do you live?

OLD MAN
Right down the street on Moorepark.

ANDY
I can swing by on my way home from
work and set it all up if you like.

OLD MAN
How much would that cost me?

ANDY
Nothing. It would be my pleasure.
I would enjoy it.

OLD MAN
That’s very kind of you.

ANDY
You're doing me the favor. E like
hooking up TVs and stereos. It’s
like solving a big puzzle.

OLD MAN
Thank you. Maybe I could bring in
something for you to eat.

ANDY
And maybe I will gladly eat it.
Just give your address to the man
at the stock room.

The old man walks off. Trish looks at Andy. Andy looks at
She stares at him for a moment, trying to figure him
She likes something about him. As she figures out what

to do about it, Andy gets nervous.

ANDY
Well, have a good day.

TRISH
Andy. It’s Andy, right?

ANDY
Last time I checked.
{nervous laugh)

54.

TRISH
Do you want to go out some time?

ANDY
(swallows)
Excuse me?

TRISH
I don't mean to be forward. I'm
sorry.

ANDY

No. Don’t be sorry.

TRISH
I just...l don‘t know, I thought it
might be fun. You seem like a good
guy.

ANDY
I would love to. That seems like
something I would like, and...yeah.
In fact, I was just about to ask
you.

TRISH
I beat you to it.

ANDY
(nervous laughter)
Yes you did.

TRISH
Great. This’ll be fun. And don‘t
worry, I'm not going to ask you to
set up my VCR.

ANDY
I would do it.

TRISK
I was joking.

ANDY
Oh. Okay.

(not getting it)
But I would do it.

They smile'at each other.

55.

INT. CIRCUIT CITY
Andy is telling David and Jay what hapgened.

DAVID
See, I told you this was the move.

JAY
Who's the girl?

Andy points to Irish who is paying for her VCR.

JAY
Her. Oh man, you hit the jackoot.
She is a waitress next store. I

went out with her two years ago,
and she is ready to go.

ANDY
Now I don’t want to go out with
her.

JAY
I didn’t do anything. We just had
one kiss.

ANDY
Oh, okay.

when Andy looks the other way Jay gestures with his hips that
he haé sex with Trish. When Andy turns back he stops.

JAY
Good for you, man. This is good.

INT. RESTAURANT — NIGHT
Andy and Trish are eating dinner.

TRISH
That‘s so funny that we work in the
same mini mall and we have never
seen each other.

ANDY
I‘ve seen you. I eat at the
restaurant you work at on Monﬁay’s.

TRISH
Really? Every Monday?

56.

ANDY
Yeah. I would eat there more, I
just don’t want to get sick of it.

TRISH
Have I ever waited on you?

ANDY
Maybe a couple of times.

It is clearly way more than a couple of times.

TRISH
How long have you worked at Circuit
City?

ANDY

Nine years.

TRISH
Wow. Do you like it?

ANDY
Not really. But it‘s a good job.

TRISH
' What would you like to be doing?

ANDY
I have a collection of antique
toys. I would like to open a
store that sells those kinds of
things. Maybe some comic books.
I don't knOw if I'll ever be able

to do it.

TRISH
Sure you will. You could do
anything.

ANDY

That’s nice of you to say. what
about you?

TRISH
I want to work at that restaurant
for the rest of my life. I have no
goals or dreams. They’ve all been
drained out of me.

ANDY
That’s not true.

57.

TRISH
I just want to be happy. I don't
care what I do, I just don’t want
it to be too hard. Less hours. I
guess what I am saying is I want to
retire.

Andy laughs.

TRISH
(sweetly)
What is with you?

ANDY
What?

TRISH
There is something about you. I
can't tell what it is.

ANDY
IS it bad?

TRISH
I think it's good. But I don’t
know. Are you for real?

ANDY
I’m real.

TRISH
Good.

CUT TO:

INT. TRISH’S APARTMENT — DAY
Andy and Trish walk in the apartment.

TRISH
Can I get you a cooktail?

ANDY
Sure. Do you have orange soda?
It's okay if you don’t. Most
people don't buy orange soda on a
regular basis. I don't know why.
It‘s really good.

Out of the blue, she kisses him hard on the mouth. The Riga
lasts a long time. At first he doesn’t know what to do, but
after about ten seconds, he actually participates.

58.

When she stops kissing and looks at him, he could not be
redder. He is stunned, but there is happiness in there.

TRISH
Let's go in the other room.

INT. BEﬂROOM — MOMENTS LATER

Trish jumps under the covers. She pulls off her shirt then
reaches under the sheets and removes her pants and underwear.

TRISH
Come on.

' ANDY
Oh. okay.

Andy gets under the covers with all his clothes on and kisses
Trish, who is now completely nude. He seems to be getting
the hang of it. There is a lot of pent»up energy there.

TRISH
Wow, you really like kissing.

ANDY
I do.

_ TRISH
Take off your clothes.

ANDY
Really?

TRISH
Is this too fast? I never do this‘

ANDY
No.

Andy takes his pants off, but strangely, leaves on his shirt.
Probably to cover his bad wax job.

Trish shuts the lights. They kiss passionately. She takes
off his shirt.

TRISH
Do you have protection?

ANDY
I don't like guns.

She laughs.

59.

TRISH
You have a silly sense of humor.
Don't worry, I think I have
something.

She reaches into the drawer in the end table and pulls out a
small whisker basket filled with condoms; She clearly has

sex often enough to need this basket. Andy does not pick up
on this.

TRISH
Put one of these on.

Andy stares at the basket, not sure what to do. He has never
worn a condom. He slowly takes one out. He reaches under
the sheets, and we can't See what he is doing but it is

obvious that he is tearing the wrapper open and attempting to
put the condom on.

Something goes wrong. He struggles.

ANDY
It tore. I need another one.
He grabs another one. The same thing happens. For reasons

which are not clear, he can not figure out how to get this
condom on properly.

Andy attempts this many more times. In quick cuts we see him
struggle with at least a dozen condoms as he gets more and
more frustrated with this process. Each time he tails, he
tosses the condom and the wrapper on the floor next to him.

Finally he gets one on.

ANDY
There you go. Sorry about that. I
always have trouble with those
things. I haven't used ‘em much.
(beat) '
My last girlfriend took pills.

TRISH
I'm sure it will be worth the wait.

Now they go at it more passionately. It seems like it is
going to happen when—~

THE DOOR OPENS - THE LIGHTS GO ON

MARLA
What is going on in here?!

60.

We reveal Trish's sixteen year old daughter, MARLA. Standing
next to her is her boyfriend MARK,

TRISH
What are you doing?

ANGLE ON

A stack of condoms and torn wrappers.
ANGLE ON MARLA ~ STARING AT THEM

MARLA
What are you doing? I can’t
believe you are allowed to have sex
but I'm notl That is sooo
unfair!i!

She slams the door and exits.

ANDY
I should go.

TRISH
No, it's okay. I just need to talk
to her.

ANDY

No, I should.

He kisses her then quickly gets out of bed and begins puttiﬂg
his clothes on. We see his insanely bad wax job has left

random strips of hair on his body. He puts his clothes on
and exits.

TRISH
I’m sorry.

ANDY
Don’t be.

He runs out. Traumatized again.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Andy rides his bike to work. He looks confused and consunued-

Everywhere he looks he sees sexual images; billboards, people
walking down the street, etc. '

He drives into the parking lot of the mini mall where CirCIJit
City is located. As he is looking his bike, he sees Beth.
the girl from the bookstore, walking from her car to work.

61.

BETH
Good morning.

Andy thinks. He remembers what he is supposed to do with
her. Ask questions.

ANDY
{after a beat)
Is it a good morning?

BETH
I hope it is.

ANDY
Hmmm.

BETH
Some days I am just not in the mood
to work.

ANDY

what are you in the mood to do?

BETH
(flummoxed)
Oh, I don't know...

ANDY
You don't know? Or do you know?

She thinks he is being sexy, but he has no idea what he is
saying.

BETH
You’re bad.

ANDY
Are you had?

Andy walks off. She looks like she is about to have an
orgasm. As she walks toward the bookstore where she works
she almost trips.

lNT. CIRCUIT CITY — DAY

Andy is selling a stereo to an UNATTRACTIVE MAN. There are
pretty girls in the store, but Andy has let the other
salesmen handle them. Jay walks over to Andy.

that sweet innocent girl you had a
crush on in high school. You know,
the cute one who never looked at
you but now she realizes she made a
mistake and wants to make up for it
by sucking your cock.

Andy backs away to the other side of the couch. She follows
him.

64.

ANDY
Oh God. Did Jay do this?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
They're good friends. They just
want you to have a good time“
Don’t worry, I've been with virgins
before. It’s okay that you know
nothing, because at the end of

everything. You're gonna do
everything. Nothing is Off limits.
They paid extra for that.

ANDY
How much are they paying you?

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
Five hundred for two hours.

ANDY
I will give you six hundred dollars
to leave now. Or we can find
someone else that you can have sex
with. I'm sure we can find someone
to use that credit on.

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN .
You don't have to have sex with me.
I've been paid. If you want I can
just go home now. No skin off my

applei
ANDY
(feels bad)
No, no, no. I‘m sorry. I've

responsibility to save the world.

They start watching the movie.

CUT TO:

% INT. HOTEL ROOM - THREE AND A HALF HOURS LATER

The prostitute is asleep. The credits are rolling on the TV.
Andy gets off the bed and looks at her. She looks sweet when

she is asleep. He gently kisses her on the Cheek, looks at
her again, then walks out the door.

CUT TO:

INT. CIRCUIT CITY » NEXT MORNING
Andy is talking to Jay, David and Cal.

CAL
And then what did you do to her?

ANDY
I was like, if this is paid for
then I am gonna get my money’s
worth!

DAVID
That's my man:

66.

ANDY
So I took her from the front. I
took her from_the back. I took her
from the side.

JAY
You did the side.

ANDY
Both sides! She was screaming.
She was like, “I want to have more

sex with you. Let’s continue to do
this dirty sex.”

CAL
How was her ass?

ANDY
It was so...perfectly in
proportion. And when I took off
her panties...they were all filled
with baby powder and--

JAY
Oh Goddammitt! Nothing happened!

ANDY
I did her. Did her...big time did
her.

CAL

That cost us five hundred bucks.

DAVED
Shut up, you kicked in twenty
bucks.

CAL

Sorry if I’m not as rich as you.

JAY
This is bullshit. I give uy.
There's no helying you.

- ANDY

Buying a streetwalker is not
helping me. I told you I wanted to
meet a nice girl. Someone I might
even like. I am not a pig like you
guys.

67.

JAY
No, you are certainly not. You are
pure as the driven snow, and you
plan on staying that way.

DAVID
Lay off. Jay.

JAY
No, I tried to do him a favor. You
know how hard it was to find her.
Someone I thought he might like.
That took work. And does he
appreciate it? No.

CAL
Does she owe us one? I mean she
took the money.

DAVID
No.

CAL
Shit.

ANDY

I’d appreciate it if you took your
nose out of my business!

Beth is walking outside of the store with a FRIEND from work.
She sees the guys arguing, but does not hear the words. From
her point of View it looks like Andy is bossing them around.
and she finds it very attractive.

ANDY
I may be a virgin, but you're the
ones who need to grow up! Life
isn’t about sex, it's about being a
good person. And I would rather
treat people well than stick my
Wiener in ‘em. And I say that
proudly. And if you don't like it,
then I’ll get some new friends.
That is if I ever really was your
friend. -

A FEMALE CUSTOMER walks up.

FEMALE CUSTOMER
Can anyone help me?

ANDY
I’d be glad to.

Andy walks off. The guys look depressed. Outside the store

Beth turns to her friend.
BETH

That guy is so hot. I could eat
him up.

INT. ANDY’S APARTMENT - EVENING

Andy walks in, pets his cat, then checks his messages.

ANSWERKNG MACHINE
Hi, this is Trish. I hope you
don‘t mind me calling you. Your
friends at work gave me your
number. I feel bad about what
happened the other night and
wondered if you would let me make
it up to you.

INT. RESTAURANT — NIGHT

Andy and Trish are having dinner.

TRISH
1 am sorry I didn’t tell you I had
kids.

ANDY

Why didn't you tell me?

TRISH
Most guys don't want to go out with
a “mother."

ANDY
Why not?

TRISH
Are you serious?

ANDY
Yeah.

TRISH

Then I won't tell you. No need to
put ideas in your head.

ANDY
How many kids do you have?

o
L' V TRISH

(pause)
Two.

ANDY
How old are they?

TRISH
Six, twelve and...twenty six.

ANDY
That's three.

TRISH
Oh. IS it?

They laugh.
ANDY
You must have been really young why

you had the twenty six year old.

TRISH
why do you say that?

ANDY
‘ Because you are so young now,

TRISH
Are you full of shit or is this
real?

ANDY

why do you keep saying that?

TRISH
(kind of kidding)
Because if you’re for real, I'm
gonna fall in love with you.

Andy blushes.

TRISH
I‘m sorry. I'm just goofing with
you.

ANDY
I know.

It is clear she is not goofing.

70.

TRISH
I was thinking, if we go out any
more, that we shouldn't have sex.

ANDY
Uh-huh.

TRISH
I just think it complicates things
too much, and then you never get to
really know someone because that is
always confusing things.

ANDY
it's very confusing.

TRISH
Does that bother you?

ANDY

Hmmm. Let me think about that. I
see what you are saying. Obviously
I want to

(whispers)
Do it.

(normal voice)
But I can see your point. If we
don’t have sex, we can really get
to know each other.

TRISH
And if that works out, then we can
have sex. Like really have sex.

They laugh.

ANDY
Just tons and tons of sex.

They both laugh. Andy could not he more relieved to have the
pressure taken away.

TRISH
(charmed)
You’re doing it again.

ANDY
What?

.L _

INT. TRISH’S APARTMENT — LATER

Andy and Trish are watching television. Her daughter, Marla,
comes inside with Trish's six yearwold daughter JULIA.

MARLA
{covers eyes) 1
Is it safe to come in or are you
doing it?

TRISH
It's safe. Marla, Julia. This is
Andy.
MARLA
(uninterested)
Hello.
Julia nods shyly.
ANDY
Hi.
MARLA
d, We came home because we got bored
‘ » and couldn't think of anything else
. to do.
JULIA

Can we watch TV?

TRISH
No. You’ve watched enough
television for today. Why don’t
you guys read?

MARLA
I am so sick of reading. That’s
all we do all day at school.

ANDY
Hey. Let me show you something.
Do you have a quarter?

Marla digs out a quarter. Andy puts it in his palm and Shows
the two of them. Then he closes his palm and opens it. It
is gone.

MARLA
You're not doing magic. are you?

72.

JULIA
I love magic. Where did it go?

Andy puts his hands out again, opens them and it is back.
Then he puts it in one palm, closes it, and it is two
quarters. -Julia squeals with delight.

JULIA
How did you do that?

ANDY
I don't know, it's, uh...magic.

Andy closes his hand, opens it and they are gone, then opens
the other hand and there are three quarters. Then he closes
his hands, opens them, and the quarters are gone but the
other hand has a dollar bill in it.

_ JULIA
That’s crazy. How did you learn
how to do that?

ANDY
I have a lot of free time.

Trish smiles. He is great with her kids.

JULIA
Can you show me how to do it?

ANDY
The magicians code says I am not
allowed to say how tricks are
performed.

Julia frowns.

ANDY
But who cares about magicians?
They're creepy anyway. If they get
mad, I'll punch them in the nose.

Julia laughs and Andy starts showing her how to do the trick-
Marla can‘t help but like him. Trish beams.
EXT. TRISH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Andy is saying goodnight to Marla.

TRISH
Aren’t you glad we didn’t do it?

73.

ANDY
So glad. Let‘s never do it.
she laughs.
TRISH
Okay.
ANDY
Do you want to go out again?
TRISH
Uh...
(quickly)
YES.
ANDY
Like in, I don’t know, fifteen
minutes?
TRISH

Or tomorrow.

ANDY
Tomorrow it is.

instigator of a kiss. It is short but sweet and heartf61t.

Andy walks off. He looks happy.

CAL

At least we know she's had sex.

DAVID
At least three times.

They laugh.

ANDY
I don’t care. I like her.

JAY
What about Beth from the bookstore?

ANDY
I don‘t know. I want to see what
happens with Trish. I am only one
man. I can‘t go out with everyone.

DAVID
I love this guy. He's already got
more women than he can handle.

JAY
I don't mean to ruin this for you,
but I had sex with her. On a first
date.

Andy stares angrily at him.

ANDY
So? What is that supposed to make
me not like her~~because she made
one terrible mistake?

David and Cal crack up.

The store

CAL
Oooohi Andy is burning you.

PAUL

ANNOYING CUSTOMER

carrying case?

JAY
Uh...okay, fine. So, I will write
this up for you and~-

ANNOYING CUSTOMER
Hold on. I think I’m gonna need
you to throw in an extended
warranty. On the house.

JAY
I can't do that.

ANNOYING CUSTOMER
Then I am going to have to take my
business elsewhere.

78.

JAY
Fine. Beat it.

ANNOYING CUSTOMER
Okay, I will take it.

JAY
Now you can’t have it. Any of it.
Sorry.

ANNOYING CUSTOMER
What? That's not fair.

JAY
Oh yeah. Well life isn't fair. I
just added a hundred dollars to the
price. I can do anything.

ANNOYING CUSTOMER
You're an asshole.

JAY
Now the stereo costs ten thousand
dollars. will that he Visa or
American Express?

ANDY
Is there a problem here?

CUSTOMER
Yeah. This jack off is trying to
charge me ten thousand dollars for
this stereo.

ANDY
Is that true?

JAY
Yes it is. Actually not. It's a
million dollars. Not fair huh?
Life can be like that.

ANNOYING CUSTOMER
Fuck this.

JAY
No, fuck you. You can't always get

JAY
Jill broke up with me.

ANDY
I'm so sorry. What happened?

JAY
She just lost her mind.

He starts crying.

JAY
It’s so unfair.

ANDY
I’m so sorry.

JAY
She caught me with this girl and
she lost her mind. It wasn’t that
big a deal. It’s so unfair. To
throw out six years over some
skank.

Cal walks in. Jay instantly acts like he is not crying. even
though there are tears pouring out of his eyes.

JAY
I just think that we should be
pushing the Bose speakers more
because they are clearly of a
higher quality.

Cal realizes something is wrong and exits.

JAY
(the moment Cal is gone)
Oh, fuck me, fuck me! Now I know
why people kill themselves. I
really understand.

ANDY
Well maybe you shouldn’t have
cheated on her.

80.

JAY
I know. I know. But it is so
unfair for her to not allow me to
learn that lesson.

David walks in to get something. Again Jay acts like nothing
is wrong, his face covered in tears.

JAY
I just think I am stronger when you
put me in afternoon shifts. E get

groggy in the morning.

David exits.

JAY
I have nowhere to go. We were
living together, but she dumped all
my stuff on the street.

ANDY
You can stay with me.
JAY
Thank you, Andy. You are a great
man.
Jay hugs Andy.
JAY

I am sorry I ever gave you a hard
time. You were right about
everything. You should never let
sex run your life. Never.

Andy knocks on the door and enters. Trish hurries over to
him.

TRISH
I’m so glad you’re here. I need
your help.

Bl.

ANDY
Sure. What is it?

TRISH
Can you take Marla to Planned
Parenthood? She wants to go on the
pill.

ANDY
Me?

TRISH
Her father is dead set against it.
I am too. But I thought maybe you
could bring her down there just to
get some information. Maybe we
could delay her for a little bit
while we figure out what to do.

ANDY
Isn’t she a little young to go on
the pill?

TRESH
She's sixteen. And she won't
listen to me. I told her she
should wait till she’s much older
to have sex, but it's hard for me
to say that when I had a kid at
seventeen. So I thought maybe she
would listen to you.

ANDY
I don’t know if I am the right
person to do this.

TRISH
Yes you are. She has no issues
with you. She likes you. Gosh,
this was so much easier when we
were young.

ANDY
Yeah.

TRISH
When we were kids, you just did it.
It was fun. It was no big deal.
There weren’t all these horrible
diseases. Now the whole thing is
terrifying.

82.

ANDY
Truly terrifying.
(beat)
Not like when we were young.

TRISH
I lost my virginity at fourteen.

ANDY
Me too. Fourteen years old. So
young. So very young.

TRISH
Now I wish she held onto it till
she was like, fifty.

ANDY
That's crazy talk.

TRISH
You‘d really be coming through for
me it you did this. I wouldn't
forget it.

ANDY
Won‘t she be uncomfortable?

TRISH
No.

ANDY
I would think it would be very
uncomfortable.

TRISH
I don't know where else to turn. I
don't want her to ruin her life.
It'll be fine.

INT. CAR — DAY
Andy is driving a sullen—looking Marla to Planned Parenthood.

MARLA
This is so gross.

ANDY
What?

83.

MARLA
You taking me here.

ANDY
I don't mean it to be gross. Your
mother thought you needed someone
to talk to.

MARLA
Andy, you’re a nice guy, but you're
practically a stranger. 1 don't
want to talk about sex with you.

ANDY
Either do I. I know it's
embarrassing, but you need to
inform yourself. I think that is
very important before you make a
life~changing decision. ‘Cause
once you have sex, there is no
turning back. You will never be
the same again, and what if you
want to go back? But yes can't.
There are no time machines. The
pendora’s box will be open.

MARLA
Okay, I get it. Stop trying to
freak me out. I’ll listen.

CUT T05

IRT. PLANNED PARENTHOOD ~ DAY
Andy and Marla sit across from JUDITH, a'counselor.

JUDITH
Coming here was a very smart thing-
to do. A lot of young people act
without thinking. Carefully
considering your options is a very
responsible way to act. You should
be proud of yourself.

MARLA
Would it be weird if I just asked
you for the pill right now?

JUDETH
A sense of humor is an effective
weapon in high school, I'm sure it
serves you well.

84.

ANDY
E was trying to tell her that there
is no reason that she needs to
engage in sexual activity at such a
young age.

JUDITH
That’s true. Your virginity is a
gift. A gift you shouldn’t be so
quick to give away.

ANDY
I completely agree.

JUDITH
There are plenty of activities you
can engage in without having sex
that can be fun and safe.

ANDY
(interested)
what kind of activities? I'm sure
she's interested in knowing.

JUDITH
Well, instead of having

intercourse, you might want to try
outercourse.

MARLA
Outercurse. Uch. What's that?

ANDY
Yeah, what's that?

Andy is leaning forward in his chair, way more interested
than Marla.

JUDITH
Outercourse is anything that isn’t
vaginal intercourse. It can he
just having tun in e nonwsexual way
with your friend. Or it can he
kissing.

ANDY
Kissing is nice.

JUDITH
And there are many ways to be
sexual without intercourse m such
as body rubbing, which you might
call “dry humping."

85.

ANDY
See, you can do that.

JUDITH
Masturbation, mutual masturbation.

ANDY
What’s that?

JUDETH
‘That's when you both masturbate at
the same time. .

ANDY
(to Marla)
You could do that instead.

JUDITH
There’s deep kissing, erotic
massage, oral sex play, role—
playing, and sharing fantasies with
a partner.

ANDY
So there are a lot of things y0u
can do instead of sex.

JUDITH
It's only limited by your
imagination.

MARLA
I think I’m gonna vomit.

JUDITH
That's very funny, but this is
serious business. Outercourse
offers nearly 100 percent
protection against pregnancy.

ANDY
That’s a plus. I didn't know that.

JUDITH
Outercourse can alSO greatly reduce
the risk of HIV/AIDS and many other
sexually transmitted infections —
unless body fluids are exchanged
through oral or anal intercourse.
But some infections. like herpes
and HPV, can be passed by skin—toe
skin contact.

. 36.
‘hru ANDY

This is fantastic. What would
someone do about performance
anxiety? ‘Cause I am sure Marla
and her friend are worried that
their sex won’t be satisfying, and
then the unsatisfied partner might
fly into a rage and break it off
with the inadequate partner.

JUDETH
Sex takes practice, but there are
many techniques to extend the
amount of time that a man can
maintain his erection. Including
visualization techniques and a
personal favorite of mine, which is
called pinching. What a woman does
is, right when her man is about to
ejaculate she pinches his———

I’ve got to get out of here.

i’m sorry. You have a lot of this
information on your web site,
right?

TRISH
I don’t know what you did, but she
has completely changed her tune.

ANDY
It wasn’t really me. She is a
smart kid. Once she got all the
right information, she knew what to
do.

TRISH
Thank you. You’d make a great dad.

ANDY
You think so.

TRISH
I know so. I’ve seen it.

ANDY
(nervously)
Well, I better get going. It's
been a long day.

TRISH
Stay.

I can't. I’ve got to...go to work

Andy is cornered. He isn't sure what to do. He doesn’t want
to do it, and he doesn’t want to debate it. He thinks, then~-

ANDY
You crazy chick. I’m gonna have to
give you one of their pamphlets.

He giggles nervously at his own joke and exits before she can
react.

INT. CIRCUIT CITY — DAY

Andy is with a FEMALE customer. He is more confident than we
have ever seen him.

ANDY
You could go that way, but for the
extra money you are getting a
product that will be the
centerpiece of your home.

FEMALE CUSTOMER
I don't know.

ANDY
Well, don’t decide today. As I
always say, there is nothing wrong
with delaying an important
decision.

FEMALE CUSTOMER
You know what, I'm gonna go for it.

ANDY
Great. I will write it up for you.

He walks to the register. Trish walks over to him.

TRI$H
'Hi, honey.

We reveal David, Jay and Cal watching this exchange.

ANDY
Oh, hi. What are you doing here?

TRISH
I knew you were working a long
shift today, so I brought you a
healthy lunch, and look. I found
you the cutest sweater.

L~ She holds it up. It is in fact a cute sweater.

ANBY
I love it. Thank you.

He gives her a quick kiss.

TRISH
Well, I have a lot of errands to
run. Marla and I are going
shopping for prom dresses. l'll
see you for dinner.

ANDY
Not if I see you first.

He laughs at his bad joke. She exits. The guys walk up to,

him.

DAVlD
How’s that healthy lunch?

David and Cal laugh.

CAL

rYeah‘ Is it healthy?

DAVID
You need to stay healthy if you
want to fit into that cute sweater.

ANDY
Guys. Come on.

CAL
So she's a grandmother,

She has a kid. That makes Trish a
grandmother.

JAY
Lay off him. He has ﬁallen for
this woman. And he is happy.
That's all that matters.

CAL
Don't get all soft because your
girl dumped you.

JAY
She didn‘t dump me. We are giving
each other some space.

DAVID
I'm not saying it's wrong, but I am
saying, you better make sure this
is what you want. As soon as the
Tupperware and the sweaters come
out, it is over. You are as good

‘ as married.

ANDY
Maybe that's what I want.

CAL
Well, getting married would be a
good way to avoid sex.
They all laugh.

longer.

She puts her hand on his crotch.

ANDY
Maybe we shouldn’t have
intercourse.

k _ TRISH
Huh?

ANDY
We’re just letting our hormones
think for us. Let’s have
outercourse.

TRISH
What is outercourse?

ANDY
Mutual masturbation. Rubbing on
each other with our clothes on.
Fooling around without exchanging
fluids. It's fun and it’s
responsible.

TRISH
rwhat the fuck are you talking
about? Are you high?

ANDY
No, K am respecting you.

ANDY
Nothing. We had an agreement.

agreement without talking to me

about it.
TRISH
I am talking to you about it now.
ANDY
Well I am saying I want to think
about it.
TRISH

For how long?

ANDY
A couple of weeks. What's the
rush?

TRISH

Because I am in love with you.

She waits for him to reply in kind, but he is stunned. He is
mainly thinking “if I say I love her, which I do, she will
want to have sex with me. What to do?"

TRISH
(she counts)
Two, three, four, five. Fuck!

ANDY
what?

TRISH
If someone doesn't say it back in
five seconds, there‘s trouble.
Anything after that is bullshit.

ANDY _
You can't put that kind of pressure
on someone.

TRISH
If you love someone, there is no
pressure. I knew I shouldn’t have
said that.

ANDY

That’s not true.

Wow, you still haven‘t said it,

What is going on? where is this
coming from?

TRISH
You fucker. Don't play head games
with me. '

it is.

Get out. Just get out. You liar.

Yes you did. You’re not who you
said you were.

ANDY
Who did I say I was?

93.

TRISH _
You said you were the one. But the
one would have passion for me.
Would want me. Would love me. He
wouldn’t always be moving away just
a little when I touched him. It‘s
cruel. So, just get out!

Andy is pushed out the door.

INT. ANDY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Andy enters his apartment. Jay is there packing up his
things,

ANDY
What happened?

JAY
Me and Jill are getting back
together. She's pregnant.

ANDY
With your kid?

' JAY
Yeah, with my kid. That's why she
broke up with me. Because she

found out she was pregnant, and she
didn't know if I would be a good
dad in light of the fact that I
cheat on her all the time.

ANDY
So this is good?

JAY
It‘s the best. 1 love her sooo
much. This was meant to happen. I
was meant to be with her and to be
the father to this child“ I will
never screw around again. I am so
lucky.

ANDY
(sadly)
E am so happy for you.

JAY
Did something happen?

95.

ANDY
I'm sorry. I don’t mean to ruin
your good news. I'm just sad
‘cause Trish wants to have sex.

JAY
That's what you wanted.

ANDY
No, she really wants to have sex.
Like right now; What do I do? If
she finds out I am a virgin she
won't like me anymore. She will
think I am a loser.

JAY
No, she won't.

ANDY
She will. What kind of man doesn’t
have sex for ﬁorty years? And I am
about to turn forty one. if I turn
forty one without having sex,
that's really oathetic.

JAY
Than don't tell her. Just have sex
with her. Give it to her really
good.

ANDY
I don’t know how to do that.

JAY
You might get lucky. You might be
good.
ANDY
Really?
JAY
Well...since you have forty years

of sexual energy stored up, there
is a chance that it might not last
very long.

ANDY
This is what I was worried about.
If I am honest, she'll think I am
defective. If I have sex it will
be bad and she won’t want to be
with me. I’ll never get a second
chance.

96.

JAY
Hold on, relax. I am going to give
you some advice right now. And I
want you to just take it because I
know what I am talking about. I
took my girlfriend for granted. I
didn't appreciate her. I didn't
accept that she was the best person
could ever dream of. And because
of that, I almost lost her. But
now that I have been honest with
her, we are going to have a long
life together. And a child.

WE’RE )
So you think I should just tail her
everything.

JAY
No. I think you should get it on
with that girl Beth from the
bookstore. Pay attention. Learn
as much as you can, then use that
knowledge with Trish.

ANDY
That doesn’t sound ethical.

JAY
What, she likes you. She wants
you. You would be giving her
something she wants. What’s
unethical about that. You aren't
asking her to marry you so you can
steal her fortune.

ANDY
That makes sense.

JAY
I think it is what Trish would
want.

ANDY

Thank you, Jay. I know I have been
tough on you, but without your

advice I wouldn't have gotten this
far.

JAY

Thanks. That means a a lot to me.
Now go get that girl.
