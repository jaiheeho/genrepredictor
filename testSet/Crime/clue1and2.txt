“CLUE

FADE IN:

EXT. A HOUSE ON A HILL - NIGHT

MUSIC: -

We are looking up at a house. It stands some distance
away, on a hill. From the moment WE SEE it we know that
it is a house of terror -— imposing, Gothic, gloomy,
menacing. Perhaps it is reminiscent of the house in
Psycho, perhaps -— though not a castle -- it has the

'deserted soulless empty quality of Kane's house when
'seen first :through its gates.

The MUSIC WE HEAR is Thriller music, urgent strings,

.suggesting panic, suggesting unspoken evil. ’Bernard

Hermann sort-of—music.

And the weather is overcast. There is a watery moon
struggling to break through racing clouds. -But a '
thunderstorm is on the way. ,

Superimpose: MAIN TITLES

‘A car turns off a highway-onto a country lane leading
vtowards the house. “The car-would not be the catls whiskers
even in the year in which this story takes place.

END TITLES - SUPERIMPOSE "1954"

,CAMERA CRANES DOWN and MOVES WITH the car AS it approaches

the-gates of the house. They are closed. A man gets out
of the car. 'He is a BUTLER. He is dressed like a butler.

' He has the manner of a butler. Even when opening gates

all alone he does so with the demeanour of a butler. ’His
name is WADSWORTH. ‘Having opened the gates, he sits back
in his car, and motors slowly up the private drive.

EXT. THE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

RUMBLE of THUNDER. Lights can be seen through some of

the ground floor windows. A savage lookingfgerman-Shepherd‘
snarls and bares his teeth at the arriving car. Another
German Shepherd is crapping on top of the front steps.

Both dogs are chained up.

'WADSWORTH gets out of the car, locks it methodically, and

mounts the -steps to. the front door. One of the dogs leaps
at him, trying to attack him. He throws a chunk of raw '
meat at the dogs. They fall upon it hungrily, and retreat

:to the side-of the steps. WADSWORTH is relieved.

CONTINUED:

He steps back, qws them - satisfied - produces a key
from his overcoat pocket, turns, steps in the dog

_shit.

INT. THE HALL - NIGHT

Methodically, WADSWORTH opens the front door: t creaks.
He comes in sniffs, makes a face, scrapes his shoe, shuts
the door, hangs up his coat on the coat stand. .He wears

.a black jacket, white tie, stiff collar and pinstripe
‘trousers. He walks acroSs the marble floor, his.foot-

steps echoing on the cold, grey stone. He stops at the
open Dining Room door and looks in. The table is
beautifully and'meticulously laid for dinner for seven.
INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

YVETTE is the French Maid- She is young, beautiful, with

’.a great figure which is tightly encased in a maidLS uni-

form —- black dress, little white apron and cap, sheer
black stockings and dainty black shoes. But the skirt is
shorter than normal, and very tight over her bottom --

and her black dress is very low cut. Her ample bosom is
pushed right up and half out of the top of the dress.

She is an outrageous young lady, with an improbable French
accent which cannot be reproduced on the page. She has
been polishing a glass, and dancing to the latest pop
music on the radio. She bends forward to replace the
glass on the tray, her breasts falling beautifully forward.
WADSWORTH watches.

WADSWORTH
Is everything ready?
‘ yvrrrr
Oui, Monsieur.

WADSWORTH
You.have your instructions.

' WADSWORTH leaves the library, YVETTE sniffs and makes a
' face. WADSWORTH crosses the hall to the kitchen.

YVETTE-looks at the bottom of her shoes, puzzled. We

’HEAR a METALLIC SCRAPING SOUND.

 

   

 

 

 

*INT.“THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

”WADSWORTH comes in._ The COOK, a plump but

inscrutable Chinese lady, is methodically sharpening ‘*

-a large shiny carving knife on a steel. In the

background is film.of SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY of

.Wisconsin on a 1950’s black and-white TV set, per-

forming characteristically at a hearing on the House
Committee of Un-American Activities. (Actual film).

WADSWORTH .
Everything all right, Mrs. Ho?

She stands up, face to face with him.

MRS.‘HO
Dinner will be ready at nine-thirty.

ﬁnd she settles down and watches the TV as WADSWORTH

leaves.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
A MAN's hand grasps hold of the bell-pull. .Pulls-

‘INT. BELL TURRET - NIGHT

The bell jerks and clangs.

INT. rm; HALL -- NIGHT
WADSWORTH is crossing the Hall. The bell stops

-clanging. He looks at his watch and nods. Every-

thing in order. He opens the door. WE SEE a
smartly turned out MAN. He is eyeing the dogs.

., WAD-5mm;
_.Good.evening.

He steps aside. ~But the MAN does not come in.
The MAN's car is parked in the drive. The dogs
are back beside their kennel, eating.

MAN _
Good evening. I don't know if...

"He'falters. 'WADSWDETH cdmes to the rescue.

- . Wanswon'm
Yes indeed sir, you are expected,

The word 'Colonel' seems to reassure the MAN a little.
He steps in, and WADSWORTH closes the front door.

Colonel Mustard, isn't it?

He holds out his hand.
COLONEL MUSTARD
(for it is he!)
No, that's not my name.- I'm
Colonel...

WADSWORTH holds up his right.hand, sharply. ‘COLONEL

'MUSTARD flinches. «Hezreminds~us a little of Colonel

‘Hall in “Sergeant Bilko“.

"“ WADSWORTH
Forgive me but tonight you may
well feel obliged to my employer-
for the use of a pseudonym.

COLONEL MUSTARD didn't quite get all that. WADSWORTH
turns and-hangs up’COLONEL MUSTARD'S coat on hook. The
COLONEL eyes him suspiciously, and sniffs the air, and
then looks at his own feet.

COLONEL MUSTARD.
-Who are you? '

~WADSWORTH
, I ameadsworth, sir. 'The Butler.

And he leads the way across the Hall. COLONEL MUSTARD
enters with reluctance and suspicion, looking up and
around the high cold Gothic hall, lit by a flickering
chandelier and shafts of moonlight Stealing through the

stained glass windows.

'INT.lLIBRARY”¥-NIGHT

YVETTE is pouring champagne at the drinks table, as

‘WADSWORTH and COLONEL MUSTARD enter. YVETTE -and the
’COLONEL look at each other with particular interest.

like all the walls, is covered in bookshelves. COLONEL
MUSTARD turns to speak to WADSWORTH just as the door has
closed. He can't even see where the door was.

COLONEL MUSTARD
Wadsworth...(realizes)
Where'd he go?

EXT. FRONT noon —;NIGHT

MRS. WHITE is standing there. .She is a pale, tragic but
beautiful looking woman in her thirties. Dark bar and
eyes, white skin, dressed in black. WADSWORTH opens the
door."

WADSWORTH
Do come in, Madam, you are
expected.

She reminds us of a woman from a Charles Adams cartoon.

‘She is holding a letter.

MRS. WHITE
Do you know who I am?

WADSWORTH
Only that you are to be known
as... Mrs. White.

MRS. WHITE
It said so in the letter. But why?

distaste. Then she checks her feet.
INT. THE LIBRARY

COLONEL MUSTARD is still looking for the door handle.
YVETTE is handing a drink to COLONEL MUSTARD. Suddenly
the door opens, and flattens him against the wall.
WADSWORTH enters, fbllowed by MRS. WHITE.

sxr. THE COUNTRY LANE -‘NIGHT
A rumble of THUNDER. A stunningly attractive woman,

whom we shall call MISS SCARLET, is bending over the
open hood of her automobile. She is staring at the‘

~engine in,despair. ~She gets into the car, and turns

the starter again._ The engine is dead.

In the distance she sees headlights coming toward her.
She tries to attract the attention of the_passing car.

He is listening to SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY coming live

also bites his nails and picks his teeth, nose1, and other

~orifices. He carries a small 1locked suitcase. As the

His actions will illustrate the words and thus make them

when you did it. The other four
murders were easy -- luck was-on your

MISS SCARLET
You've no proof.

WADSWORTH
The gun is missing. Gentlemen,
turn out your pOckets, ladies
_your purses. Whoever has the gun
is the murderer. '

MISS SCARLET suddenly produces the gun.

MISS SCARLET
Brilliantly worked out, WADSWORTH.
I congratulate you.

COLONEL MUSTARD
Here, here.

MISS SCARLET snarls at him.

MISS'SCARLET

Shuttup!
MR. GREEN
But there's one thing I don't
understand.
- . ALL
One thing??
MR. GREEN

Yes —— why did you do it? Half

of Washington knows what kind of
business you run -- you weren't in
any real danger, the whole town
would be implicated if you were
exposed.

MISS SCARLET . .
I don't think they know my real bUSiness.
My business is secrets. And Yvette found
them out for me -- the secrets of Senator
Peacock's Defense Committee, of Colonel
Mustard's fusion bomb. of Professor '
Plums's U.N. contracts, and.of the work
Of your husband the nuclear physicist.

iij . She is looking at MRS. WHITE.
MR. GREEN
So it is political. You're a

Communist.
MISS SCARLET laughs.

MISS SCARLET

The State Department has always
been so unsophisticated. 'No, Mr.
'Green, Communism is just a Red

. herring. Like all members of the

, . ‘ oldest profession, I'm a capitalist.

I shall sell my secrets -- your
'secrets e- to the highest bidder.

, COLONEL MUSTARD
And if we don't cooperate?

MISS SCARLET
Then just like Mr. Boddy, I
shall .expose you.

PROFESSOR PLUM
But we can expose yo . Six
murders.

 

MISS SCARLET
. I hardly think it will enhance your
reputation at the UN, Professor Plum.
if it is revealed that you have been .
implicated not only in adultery with
a patient but in her death and the
deaths of five other people.

__ 'PROPESSOR PLUM

You don’t know the kind of people
they have at the UN. I might go
up in their estimation;

COLONEL MUSTARD
It's no good blackmailing me,
Madam -- I've no more money.
ALL
Nor have I.

MISS SCARLET

I know, sweetie-pie -- but
you can pay me in Government
information.

(looks around)
All of you.

(turns tO WADSWORTH)
Except yOu, Wadsworth -- you --.
-as a mere butler, have no access
to Government secrets. So I'm
afraid your moment has Come.

She turns the gun on him. The.0THERS respond appropriately
-- one or two watch with horror, others can't bear to look.

WADSWORTH
.Not so-fast, Miss Scarlet; I
do have a secret or two.

MISS SCARLET is unimpressed. Her finger is ready on
the trigger. ‘

‘ MISS SCARLET
Oh yeah? ’Such as?

. WADSWORTH _
The game's up, Scarlet.. There's
-no more bullets in that gun.

MISS'SCARLET'
You think I'll fall for that old
trick?

_ WADSWORTH
It's not a trick. There was one
shot at Mr. Boddy in the Study; '
two that shot down the chandelier;
two at the Lounge door and.One for
uthe Singing Telegram.

MISS SCARLET
That's not six.

WADSWORTH
One plus two plus two plus one.

The .OTHERS are watching, 2- and counting furiously on
their fingers. '

MISS SCARLET
NO, there was only one shot
that got the chandelier --
that's one plus two plus one
plus one.

MISS SCARLET
Okay, one plus two plus...
The oint is, there's one more

bullet in here and-guess who's gonna
get it!

The FRONT DOOR BELL RINGS. MISS SCARLET turns
vautomatically toward the door. WADSWORTH leaps
forward, smashes the gun out of her hand, and holds
Vher in a-vice-like grip. MR. GREEN opens the front
door and several FBI AGENTS and COPS burst in, guns in
hand. OTHER AGENTS spread out into various room

and reappear almost immediately.

THREE AGENTS.
-'-(to each other,
all together)
There's a body in there:

Then they realize that the OTHER‘TWO AGENTS said the
very same words. They can't believe their ears.

'I did warn you, my dear. Mr.
Hoover is an expert on Armageddon.

MISS SCARLET turns to WADSWORTH.

_ MISS SCARLET .
Wadsworth.don't hate me for
trying to shoot you.

- WADSWORTH
‘Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a
>damn.
(he raises his revolver)
As I was trying to tell you, there
were no bullets left. See?

He pulls the trigger. The GUN GOES OFF! WADSWORTH is
shocked, then puzzled.

WADSWORTH

thoughtfully)
One plus two plus...

The other chandelier CRASHES down behind COLONEL MUSTARD.
