OVER BLACK

BLFIE'S VOICE
You’re quite luckyr you know...

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT — LATE AFTERNOON

CAMERA EXPLORES the room... Modest, messy and male. Just the
basics. No photos of family or friends. Only telltale signs
of a singleF untidy man living alone. An ad. torn from a
magazine, picturing a classic Morgan sports car is taped to
the refrigerator with Ean£_l£ scrawled in black marker.

A stack of books - French for Fun, Dress For Success Fbr
Less — A Guide 1b New York’s Designer Discount warehouses.

A clock on the night—stand tells us it's half past two.

ALEIE’S VOICE
—— I rarely allow anyone into my
flat.

TRACK IN DN — ALEIE

Sleeping, with a wry smile on'his face. A heat, then... One
eye POPS OPEN and Alfie GLANCES CDNSPIRAIORIALLY at CAMERA.

This is something he will do'throughout our story... speak in
intimate asides to the audienbe, as though he’s talking to a
friend. Other characters within the scene will be oblivious.

ALFIE

[to CAMERA]
I know... humble digsIr not exactly
what you'd call a ‘panty peeler’...

He pulls himself out of bed, wearing only striped silk pajama
bottoms,r drops to the floor.

ALFIE icont'd]
Know what I mean?

With that, he begins a quick series of crunches.

Alfie is an Englishman in his early thirties with tousled
good—looks and a healthy dose;of cockiness. He lives in
perpetual motion and has the youthful air of a guy who’s
managed to escape the normal adult responsibilities and
emotions.

 

ALFIE (CONT'D}
[to CAMERA, while doing
crunches}
—— but it works for me. To be
honest, i rarely spend a night in
my own bed anyway...

Another five or six crunches.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
There we go. Ten crunches is all I
need. Try not to hate me for it.

Alfie continues talking TC CAMERA as he hops up and gathers a
handful of vitamins from various bottles and pours some
water.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Now with women, generally speaking,
if a guy's a good provider and a
nice chap, six-pack abs aren’t
really a deal—breaker. In fact, if
he’s in the right tax bracket, a
bloke can be bald, wear a truss,
have seizures — and'still get
shagged.

Alfie swallows a mouthful of vitamins with water, then grabs
a pack of Dunhills.

ALFIE [CONT'D]

(confidentially)
On the flip—side, even though the
politically—correct bloke sitting
next to you will deny it — for us
men, when it comes to women, it's
all about the F.B.B. ~ face, boobs,
bottom. I mean, sure, we'd like a
cool gig tossed in for good
measure, like say...
multi—millionaire hotel chain
heiress. But above all else —
‘looks rule'.

He lights his cigarette and gives CAMERA a sly shrug.

ALFIE [CONT'D]
Just being honest.

INT. TINY BATHROOM

Alfie turns on the shower, cigarette dangling from his lips,
unties his drawstrings, looks up, remembering THE CAMERA.

 

ALFIE (cont'd)
Give us a bit of privacy now.
(a beat}
No, really, turn away.

He SHOGS US AWAY, then slips out of his pajama bottoms and
into the shower, pulling the shower door closed behind him.

ALFIE (CONT'D)
All right, you can look back. Hang
on, I'll be quick.

Through OPAQUE GLASS, we watch Alfie lathering up.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
{shouting over the shower}
I know you’re expecting the opening
credits now but we'll save you the
thrill of knowing the Key Grip's
name ‘til the end of the flick.

He peeks his SOAPY HEAD out, looks about fifteen...

ALFIE {CONT'D}
So, while I lather up, why don't
you settle in with the popcorn you
overpaid for and we can begin.

Alfie ducks back into the shower and begins singing a
garbled, almost unrecognizable version of I Gotta Be me.

A CLOSET DOOR SLIDES OPEN

ALFIE {0.5.}
It’s been said that clothes speak
the international language...

REVEALING Alfie’s small but fastidiously organized and
supremely fashionable WARDROBE. Alfie sorts through the
choices, while glancing over his shoulder AT CAMERA.

ALFIE (CONT'D)
And I admit I am a bit of a fashion
whore. But, I believe, to be
satorically—correct, a man requires
only a few well—chosen basics.

A SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE CUTS

Alfie, posing as if for a GE layout, wearing a quick
succession of STYLISH WARDROBE COMBCS. He models these
outfits in a slightly rumpled, hair tousled sort of way,
giving the impression of newer trying too hard.

 

BACK TO SCENE

He selects a pin-striped suit from the closet.

ALFIE

Unfortunately, today I'm off to
work so we've got to tone it down a
bit. _

[holds up suit}
Gucci - End of Summer Sale. Very
understated.

[takes out a very pink

shirt)
But I can easily spice it up. When
you ooze masculinity, as some of us
do, you have no reason to fear
pink. .

He holds up the shirt and suit together.

ALFIE (CONT'DJ
Smashing.

A little smile as he picks up a bottle of Acqua Di Gio
cologne.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Now, most men overdo it in the
cologne department. Americans
practically spray it on with a Crop
duster.

{dabs his wrists}
My rule: Nothing above the neck.

Alfie then splashes a bit on his fingers and drops his HAND
BELOW FRAME.

ALFIE {CONT'DJ
Though I do believe in a quick
splash on the old Eiffel Tower.
(winks)
Never knew where the day might
take you.

INTr APARTMENT — FRONT DOOR - MINUTES LATER

Alfie, dressed smartly in his suit and a carefully chosen
tie, adjusts his cuff—links and starts to exit, snaps his
fingers, remembering something.

ALFIE
Almost forgot——

 

He crosses to the dresser and tears a page off a WORD FOR THE
ﬂAY CALENDAR.

ALEIE {cont'dj
New word for the day:
{reading calendar)
Os—tenuta—tioua. “The attempt to
attract attention to one’s self.”

He looks in the mirror.

ALFIE (CONTTD}
Who? Me? '

INT. HALLWAX
Alfie steps out, locks his apartment door, TURNS to CAMERA:

ALFIE
Oh, blimey, I’m.rude, I forgot to
introduce myself. I'mmw

A WOMAN’S VOICE
-- Alfie! '

FREEZE FRAME. OVER:

ALFIE’S VOICE
There you go.

sorrow assumes and Alfie turns TO cameras with a big grin.

ALFIE
Alfie.

He turns to see LU SCHNITMAN, an overweight woman in her
sixties with pendulous breasts and a coquettish grin.

MRS. SCHNITMAN
Were you the little elf who left
those mocha hon-bone on my
doorstep?

Alfie glances at CAMERA, shrugs.

ALFIE
{to CAMERA)
They were passing out free samples
in the village.
[to MRS. SCENITMAN}
Perhaps you have a secret admirer,
Mrs. Schnitman.

 

MRS. SCHNITMAN
What do I have to do to get you to
call me Lu?
{then} _
Alfie, you're a doll, but I‘m
supposed to be on a diet.

ALFIE
You? A diet?

He crosses to her and leans in with a husky whisper.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
I don't mean to be forward, Lu, but
don’t you know a full-figured gal
like yourself is every man’s secret
fantasy?

As Mrs. Schnitman melts, Alfie LOOKS UP to CAMERA:

ALFIE ECONT'D}
All right, she’s a tub of lard, bu:
the ship’s already sailed, so why
not let her feel good about
herself? Know what I mean?

He starts out, turns back to Mrs. Schnitman.

ALFIE [CONT‘DJ
Oh, Lu, don’t feel you have to, but
the key's under the mat if you‘re
up for a bit of your fabulous dust-
busting.

The look on her face tells us she can't wait to grab that
Dirt Devil...

And with that, MUSIC BEGINS: Sting singing, Englishman In New
York.

EXT. SOHO STREET - DAY (MUSIC OVER}

Alfie expertly weaves through the gridlock on his mint—
condition, vintage VEEPA, all the while SPEAKING to CAMERA.
Alfie smiles at every SEXY WOMAN he passes. Most smile back.

ALFIE
I migrated to the States a few
years back ‘cause I had a mate who
knew a bloke who crossed the pond,
snagged a job and in less than two
years wound up owning the joint.

 

A STUMNER gives him the oncesover.

ALFIE [cont'd}

But, more importantly, I always
heard the most beautiful women in
the world reside in Manhattan. And
when it comes to shagging birds,
it's all about location, location,
location.

(gestures to PASSING

WOMEN)
And just look around - every one
unique and special, like
snowflakes.

(breathes in the city)
God, I love this city. And, I
mean, with such a plethora —
calendar word — meaning abundance
of gorgeousneSs and diversity...

Alfie pulls into the RED ZONE in front of an OUTDOOR CAFE,
where a curvy Hispanic METER MAID is writing up a ticket.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
rv how could I ever choose to
settle down with just one?

The Meter Maid looks up at Alfie, then at the RED ZONE, then
gives him a scolding look. Alfie approaches, all charm.

ALFIE [CONT'D]
Desperately need a spot of tea,
Lindy. Do us a favor.

METER MAID
[flirtatiouslyl
As long as you return it. Again.
ALFIE
As long as you wear the uniform.

Again.
Alfie offers Lindy his patent killer smile, pats her butt and
cruises toward a cafe table. Lindy watches him for a moment,
slaps a ticket on someone’s car. He’s made her day.
ALFIE - SEATED AT THE CAFE (MUSIC CONTINUES)

He sips a cup of tea, while observing a parade of scurrying
suits and shoppers laden with designer store bags.

 

ALFIE Eoont’d}

(to CAMERA}
I watch this parade of conspicuous
consumption and upward mobility
and think to myself, America — take
a tea break.

(his cell phone RINGS,

checks caller ID]
Annie? Incredible! I was just
thinking about you.

(whispers, into phone}
I'm with a client at the moment,

luvr ring you later? Kiss -kiss.
{clicks off, back to
CAMERA]

I myself subscribe more to the
European philosophy, my priorities
leaning toward wine, women and--
{cooks his head, smiles}
—— well, actually that’s it, wine
and women.
{then}
Although women and women is always
a fun option.
{finishes tea}
So.
(rising)
To live life to the fullest-—

He glances around, casually slides the tray of remaining TEA
BAGS into his coat pocket and starts off...

ALFIE {CONT'D}
-- I require only enough to cover
my modest expenses:
{turns back}
I've got no desire to be the
richest stiff in the cemetery.

EXT. CEMETERY — EVENING

Quiet. Eerie. Shadows on tombstones. CAMERA GLIDES over
the graveyard toward a LIMO parked on a road above. CLOSER.
CLOSER. Right up to:

‘IHE LIMO'S WINDOW
A heat. Then, a hair-raising SCREAM. And a WOMAN'S FACE

bolts INTO FRAME. She continues SHRIEKING as she moves up and
down, in the heat of passion...

 

INT. LIMO - SAME TIME

.x’"
The woman is DORIE, a suburban housewife in her late
thirties. she's in the throes of intense love making... her
skirt pulled up around her waist, bra unhoeked, blouse open.

She’s straddling Alfie and as her moans of pleasure grow
LOUDER, Alfie gives a LOOK to CAMERA.

ALFIE

(softly, to CAMERA}
I think this just might be my
favorite position. I know it was
President Kennedy's, He was such a
great leader. Of course, JFK used
the old ‘bad back’ excuse, but, if
you ask me, the Prez knew it gave
you maximum pleasure with minimum
exertion.

Dorie reaches a climax during above and now collapses into
Alfie's arms...

DORIE
Mmmm... What is it about the back
of a limo?

Alfie kisses her neck, while CONTINUING to CAMERA.

ALFIE
She’s right, you know. If you
haven’t tried it limo-style, I give
it my highest recommendation. Of
course, you usually don't get the
full undress--

Dorie buries her head in his neck...

ALFIE {CONT‘DJ
[to CAMERA}
—e but that can be an added bonus.
I mean, once you've seen a bird in
the buff, it’s like unwrapping the
same birthday gift again and again.
Know what I mean?

DORIE
{purring}
What would I do without my weekly
Alfie fix?

They kiss, he caresses her, SPEAKS to CAMERA.

 

ALFIE
Obligatory cuddling... Thousand
one... thousand two... thousan --

Alfie glances at his watch, tape it a couple of times to get
it going, then bolts up, pretending to suddenly realize the
hour.

ALFIE [CONT‘DJ
Cripes, I've gotta get cracking,
luv... I've a ten o'clock pick-up.

Dorie sits up, stretches, pulls up her lacy red bra.

DORIE
Oh, better hurry, you don't want to
keep her waiting.

Alfie helps Dorie fasten her bra, while he TALKS to CAMERA:

ALFIE
Luckily, this one's only a wee bit
possessive...

He kisses Dorie's HAND, then EASES IT to CAMERA, showing us a
WEDDING RING.

ALFIE {Corr ' D}
—— Married, you see. I love
married. No property rights.

Alfie watches with appreciation as Dorie stretches out her
long shapely leg, adjusting her garter belt.

ALFIE [CONTTD]

{to CAMERA}
Quite the number, isn’t she? Yet,
she tells me her old man hasn't
shagged her in six months. Thank
God there are gents like me ‘round
to pick up the slack.

[to DORIE}
You deserve to be appreciated...

[BACK to CAMERA}
-- While she's in her prime.

(to DORIE, caressing her

leg, pats her tush]
Mmm, legs like a racehorse... The
perfect yoga butt...

{BACK to CAMERA}
-— I give it my highest
grade — A minus.

 

11.

He reaches down, puts on a CHAUFFEUR’S HAT and adjusts it
“jusL so".

INT. LIMO - TRAVELING r NIGHT

Alfie drives while Dorie sits in the backseat, freshening her
make—up and punching the RADIO BUTTONS, looking for a song
she likes. .

ALFIE
Where did we tell the old man we
were going tonight?

DORIE
{punching stationsJ
Movie...

ALFIE
Treasure, please quit messing
about, you'll ruin my pro-sets.
{then}
What movie?

Dorie settles on a slow-jam.

DDRIE
I don't know. What’s the
difference?

ALFIE
The difference is, the more details
you give, the less interested your
hubby will be. If you want to stop
someone from being suspicious, tell
‘em more than they want to hear.
When lying, never be vague.

DORIE
It doesn't matter what I say. It
would never occur to Phil that
another man would look twice at me.

ALFIE

Dor, darling, if you're fishing for
a compliment, you should know by
now they only come when least
expected.

(offers a tin]
how, have an Altoid so Phil doesn‘t
smell the Alfie on your breath.

DORIE _.
I don’t care if he does.

 

12.

hlfie sighs, LOOKS to CAMERA.

ALFIE .
If there’s one thing that puts me
off marriage, it's married women.

Dorie pops the Altoid in her mouth and chases it with a swig
of vodka. She checks to make sure Alfie’s not looking, then
mischievously slips her LACY RED THONG into the pocket of his
jacket, which is neatly folded over the front seat.

She wraps her arms around Alfie, nibbling on his ear, as he
drives and TALKS to CAMERA.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
What Dorie doesn’t know is — we
won’t be seeing much more of her.
Yeah, I've got that all-too
familiar feeling that, before long,
she'll be wanting a bit more than
I'm able to give.

DORIE
Wouldn't it be great if I was going
home with you tonight instead of
Phil the Pill?

Alfie gives a knowing side—long glance TO CAMERA. As they
pull up to a RED LIGHT, Doric grabs Alfie by his tie, pulling
him close.

DORIE (CONT'DJ

{POUtYl
Baby, I’m.not ready to let you go-—

ALFIE
(re: his tie} _
Careful, darling, Ralph Lauren —
Purple Label—u

Before he can finish, Dorie YANKS Alfie down by his favorite
tie.

DDRIE
It’s him!

Alfie drops onto the front seat, while Dorie flattens herself
in the back.

ALFIE
Him who?!

 

13.

Alfie and Dorie are now both LYING FLAT in their respective
seats, WHISEERING to one another.

DORIE
My husband just pulled up next to
us]

RLFIE

What the bloody hell am I ducking
for - he doesn't know me!

(then)
Besides, one-way windows.

DORIE
Ch, right. Sorry.

Alfie nonchalantly sits up, straightening his tie. He
casually LDWERS HIS WINDOW and glances over at PHIL, a
harried, 36—going—on—ED, balding exec sitting in the back of
a taxi, talking on his cell. Alfie gives him a little salute.

Phil, a bit confused, returns the gesture. FREEZE FRAME.
OVER:

ALFIE’S VOICE
Yep, it's definitely time to stage
aqumﬁrmgam.

EXT. HUDSON RIVER - WATERWAYS FERRY — TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Alfie and Dorie standing in the shadows. Alfie takes her
face in both hands and kisses her. Dorie doesn't realize
this is their final goodwbyer

DORIE
Next Tuesday? Same time? Same
place? '

Alfie feigns disappointment.

ALFIE
Sorry, luv, that’s Fashion Week...
I’m booked double shifts.
(peck on the cheek}
I’ll ring you the instant things
let up.

DORIE
I’ll be doing my Kegel exercises.
{kisses him)
In the meantime, T left you a
little souvenir to.remember me
by...

l

 

14.

Alfie looks at her guizsioally but before he can respond,
she’s started up the stairs to the ferry.

ALFIE
Oh, Der...
(she turns back]
Your derriere looks rather
ravishing from this vantage point.

DDRIE
Why, thank you, kind sir.

ALFIE
{a grin)
See. A compliment. When you least

expect it.
She smiles down at Alfie and bounces up the stairs.
ALFIE WATCHES

Dorie approach Phil, who's wearing a trench coat and carrying
an over—stuffed briefcase. Phil gives her a quick peck on
the cheek and moves off, heading for the Ferry, leaving her
five steps behind. Dorie looks down at Alfie, shrugs and
smiles. Alfie blows her a kiss, TURNS to CAMERA.

ALFIE {COWT'DJ

What can I tell you — happy as a
pup with two tails;' And I reckon
I‘ve done old Phil a good turn -
but of course, he'd be the last to
see it.

(sighs, reflective}
Never expect any thanks in this
life, you know what I mean?

Alfie checks his watch, starts back toward his Limo.

ALFIE {COWT'D)
So. Tuesday, 10:03 PM. Do I drag
meself home to a cold flat and
empty fridge?
[checks himself in sider
mirror}
Dr, nip cross town to a warm body,
hot bath and breakfast in bed?
{mock-mulling} _
Decisions, decisions.

 

15.

EXT.KINT. JULIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT fr,

THROUGH THE wrwoow. we see JULIE. 26, a Winsome working sirlr
with an ever-so-slight weight issue. Her apartment is smell
and warm, homey on a budget... At the moment, she‘s peering
expectantly out the window, waiting for somebody.

ALFIE'S VOICE
Yeah, think I'll pay a visit to my
semi~regular, quasi-sort-of...

INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT — CONTINUOUS

Julie turns from the window to stir a big pot of chili on the
stove. FREEZE FRAME.

RLFIE'S VOICE
—— My Sweet Julie...

ACTION RESUMES and there's a KNOCK on the door. Julie fluffs
her hair, hits a spritz of perfume between her breasts, picks
up a stereo clicker and presses “play", filling the room_with
Teddy Pendergrass.

JULIE
Forget your key again, Alfie?

She opens the door, the eagerness leaving her face when she \
discovers TERRY, a cute, slightly awkward young guy. In his
hands, he cups a perfect PEAR,

JULIE [cont'd]
(amused, but...)
Terry — you need to stop.

She lowers the CD player with the remote.

TERRY
I know, the drop-by thing is
totally uncool, but I saw this pear
and thought it'd be perfect for
you.

She looks at him, baffled. He grins. She's grins. He’s
cute. '

TERRY [CONT‘D]
Remember, date three, I made baked
ziti and we rented JGodfather II’?
And young Don Corleone brought his
wife a pear wrapped in brown paper,
‘cause it's all he could afford——

 

15.

JULIE
—— and she said, ‘What a nice
pear... ‘

TERRY

—— And you thought that was really
romantic. Now every time I see a
pear, I... you know, think of you.
And you may not realize this, but
there are thousands of pears in
this city.

JULIE
{laughs, trying to move
off the subject}
Terry, by any chance, has there
been a little drinking going on
this evening?

TERRY
No. No. Two brews.
{beat}
And a shot of tequila.
{beat}

Naybe another beer. The thing

is... And another tequila. Or two.
{then}

The thing is I had the best four

and—a—half dates of my life with

you...

JULIE
{gently}
Terry... when I broke it off, the
half-a-date night, it was because I
suddenly realized it was a mistake
trying to see anyone else. I'm
really sorry if I hurt——

Her robe falls open slightly.

JULIE {CONT‘D}
—— you.

Terry gulps, looks away, tortured... as Julie quickly ties it
back. He's crazy for her.

TERRY
{half to himself]
That kind of thing really doesn't
help...

 

1T.

JULIE '
Look, I know my ‘situation' doesn’t
appear to be perfect on the surfaoe

but...
she shrugs.
TERRY
End where's the lucky bastard
tonight?
JULIE

He had a double shift.
{off Terry's doubting
look}

Terry, don’t start...

TERRY
I just don't want to see you
treated like some kind of a-r

JULIE
{finish the sentence)
—— a...?

TERRY
{shrugs}
-- Booty oall.

JULIE
Eye, Terry.

TERRY
Okay, okay... I’m sorry. I'm outta
here.
{lingering}
How’s Max?

JULIE
Great. He's great.

TERRY
That’s great.

Awkward moment.

TERRY {CONT'D}
So...

Julie taxes the pear from him.

JUL IE
Thanks for the nice pear.

 

18.

They smile. She kisses him on the cheek. He turns and their
lips aooidently meet. She eases away and shakes her head,
giving him a little smile. He steps forward but she pushes
him playfully out the door.

When she closes the door, her smile fades... And she stands
there unsettled...

INT. STRTRWELL - JULIE'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Terry trudges down the stairs, as the front door opens and
Alfie ENTERS carrying the bottle of Etoli from the Limo and
taking the stairs two—at—a—time. As they pass. Terry steals
a glance at Alfie, who either ignores him or doesn't know he
exists.

JULIE'S FRONT DOOR

A KEY in the lock and Alfie lets himself in. He sees Julie
stirring the chili.

ALFIE
I have an alibi, your honor.

JULIE
Let me guess,r unexpected late night
fare?

Alfie moves into the kitchen, slips his arms around her
waist.

JULIE [CDNT‘D]
What was it this time — blonds,
brunette or jet black Goth chick?

Alfie kisses her neck, sneaks a GLANCE at CAMERA.

ALFIE
When trapped, it’s sometimes best
to admit the truth - they'll never
believe it.
{to JULIE]

I had a very demanding last minute
ride - spoiled Long Island
housewife.

JULIE
You had her? Am I supposed to read
anything into that choice of words?

 

19.

ALFIE
{to CAMERA}
Make that: they’ll usually never
believe it.

JULIE
And where, exactly, do you take
someone’s wife at this hour?

ALFIE
Where didn’t I take her, she had me
going up and down for hours.

He pulls her close.

JULIE
Is that supposed to be funny--
{he runs his finger across
her upper lip}
—— ‘cause it's so very"—
{kisses her gently}
—— not.
{kisses her again}
You’re a conceited...
{kisses her}
—— lying...
{kisses her}
—— irresponsible...
{and again} .
-- English asshole-
{and again}
Don’t kiss me again.

But instead, SHE kisses him. Alfie hoists her up, trots
across the room and they fall on to the sofa. He nuzzles her,
burying his face in her hair.

JULIE (CONT'DJ
I’m_not kidding, Alfie, I hate you
sometimes.

He kisses her again... their bodies coming together. .A long,
sexy kiss, she’s totally gone now. Julie unhuokles his
belt...

ALFIE
You have a unique way of showing
it.

She starts pulling his pants down. Alfie eases away.

 

20.

ALFIE [CONT'DJ
Darling, can we... Sorry... Can we——
[she won't let him go}
—— hit ‘pause'? I just need a
second to unwind...

He rises, pulling up his pants, tries to distract her with:

ALFIE (CONT'D)
I've knicked a half bottle of StoLi
from the limo.
{starts toward kicchen}
How do you want yours, luv — rocks?

Julie grabs him, pulling him back down...

JULIE
I just want my usual, Alfie -
Straight Up.

She kisses him, goes for the belt buckle again... He eases
away. Again. Heads for the kitchen area, walking backwards,
feigning exhaustion.

ALFIE
I'm totally knaokered, baby. I‘Ll
make it up to you in the morning.
Cross my heart.

He picks up Terry’s “perfect” PEAR.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
But tonight...

Before Julie can speak, Alfie takes a BIG BITE out of Terry's
pear. Julie gasps, looks at him, annoyed.

ALFIE [CONT'DJ
{chewing}
—— all I'm good for is a quick
bite, hot bath and a long night’s
kip.

He opens the fridge, drops a couple of ice cubes into a glass
and pours himself a stiff one: He wipes his hand along his
side and feels something in his jacket pocket.

JULIE
{from sofa}
You know, this isn’t a hotel,
Alfie.

 

21.

Alfie pulls Dorie's LACY RED THONG from his jacket pocket and
looks at it, momentarily confused. As Julie entersr Alfie
quickly stuffs the thong back in his pocket. turning to her
with a big smile.

ALFIE
Say again?

JULIE
Why are you so ‘totally knackered’?
I mean, where were you tonight...
really?

As Alfie leans over to sample the chili with a wooden spoon,
he deftly drops Dorie's LACY RED THONG in the trash bin and
buries it with his foot.

ALFIE
I thought we weren’t asking those
questions in this relationship.

Julie, getting emotional, makes the appropriate “quote" marks
as she speaks.

JULIE
It was always you who wanted to _
have an ‘understanding’, your
words. Well, I think it’s time for r

a ‘new understanding', my words.

ALFIE

(re: Chili}
You really must open a restaurant,
Jules. This is seriously brilliant.

JULIE
{oh, please]
Alfie, it’s just ohili.

{then}
Look at me.
{he does}
I can’t keep doing this. I'm
serious. I need to know if we have I
a future or if... I’m.just some

kind of glorified ‘booty call'?
Alfie pulls her close, LOOKING over her shoulder AT CAMERA.

ALFIE
Is she not adorable? Problem is
she doesn’t have enough of the
superficial things that really
matter.

ALFIE [cont'd]

She's cute, absolutely - but not
drop-dead. I know, sounds shallow
but I told you how we men are — we
want ‘show-stoppers‘, that’s all it
is. I mean, even mangy old
Quasimodo, the Hunchback, thought
he deserved a babe.

{to Julie)
1 don*t deserve you.

JULIE
That's probably true but,
unfortunately for me... I love you,

Alfie.
Alfie stands uncomfortably, then turning to get more ice...

ALFIE
Thanks, baby.

JULIE
(on verge of tears}
Jesus, Alfie! After eight months,
I say ‘I love you' and thanks is
the best you can do?!
(slams freezer door]

ALFIE
{anxiously, to CAMERA]
oh dear...
[gently, to JULIE)
All right, sshhh... C’mon now... we
don't want to wake——

LITTLE voice to. s.)
—" Mas!

Alfie and Julie turn to see MAX, a sweet little twowand—ae
half—year—old boy standing in the doorway, wearing mismatched
pj’s. Alfie offers a quick sigh of relief TO CAMERA.

ALFIE
Hey little man, we wake you?

Max nods, extends his arms. Alfie crosses to him, SPEAKING
to CAMERA along the way.

ALFIE [CDNT‘D]
Lads, learn from mywmistake, never
get involved with a single mums

Alfie lifts Max, who wraps his arms around Alfie's neck.
Alfie makes a face, cracking Max up.

 

- \.

23.

CAMERA FOLLOWS them into MAX’S ROOM, a tiny alcove off the
main room. Alfie lays Max on his little bed. while TALKING
to CAMERA. '

ALFIE [COMT'D]
See, they come with accessories,
some of which can be... quite
irresistible.

Alfie pulls Max's sheet over his head, slips on his shades
and in an instant, is transformed into a cool version of “The
Invisible Man”. Max cracks up.

Alfie turns TD CAMERA, with a shrug.

ALFIE {cont'd}

Yeah... this little nipper made off
with my heart.

(rumples Max’s hair, to

MAX)
Hey, Pookie...

{to CAMERA)
And there’s absolutely nothing
worse than realizing you care about
someone...

[pulls up covers, tucking

Max in}
I know that sounds a bit frosty,
but the truth is, sooner or later,
one way or anotheree

He watches Max's eyes flutter and close.

ALFIE {cont’d}
-- it's gonna find'a way to knock
you sideways... Yeah, I’m mad for
this little character...

Alfie sees Julie standing in the doorway.
ALFIE [CONT'D]
(sighs, to CAMERAJ
—e It’s Jules that’s the problem.
He crosses to her, SPEAKING to CAMERA on the way.
ALFIE {CONT'D}
Can’t very well tell her that and
break her heart, now, can I?

They speak in the hallway, in hushed tones.

 

24.

JULIE
(softly)

Is this it? Is this all it will
ever be?

ALFIE
l know..7 You're right, he deserves
a proper ‘Dad'... Not some limo
driver who's poor as a shit—house
rat.

JULIE

Jus: say it, Alfie, we're not
enough for you.

Alfie chooses his words carefully.

ALFIE
It’s difficult, Jules... I care so
much for you both, but I'm still, I
don't know... a bit of a kid

myself, you know.

JULIE
{knowing he's right]
And one kid can't raise another...

MAX
(groggy, eyes Closed)
Poem, Alfie.

Alfie, grateful for the distraction, crosses and sits on the
edge of Max’s bed.

ALFIE
Here's one my dear step—mum used to

tell me...
(softly, with a ‘working—
class' accentl

New... There was an old hooker from
Brighton,

who did so many Johns it was

Julie can‘t help herself and smiles hitter-sweetly...

ALFIE’3 VOICE
I feel sorry for the poor old

gone.

NEW ANGLE — REVEALING ALFIE
Zipping through traffic on his Vespa, TALKING to CAMERA.

ALFIE
Yep, sights like that make you
realize it’s important to know your
own expiration date.

He rounds a corner and pulls up in front of a drab building:
ELEGANT LTMUUSINE SERVTCE. A smaller, hand-printed sign
reads: For Sale By Owner.

ALFIE (cont'dl
Our shelf lives are limited, so
it’s best to strike while you're in
your prime. -

Alfie parks near the front steps, indicates sign.

ALFIE [CDNT‘DJ

The standards for ‘elegance' have
taken quite a pounding, wouldn‘t
you say?

(as he dismounts, locks

up}
Still, this is where I make my
reasonably honest living. Heavy
accent on the ‘reasonably’. it’s a
mere stepping stone.

He gestures to a good-looking Black guy in his twenties,
MARLON, sitting on the steps, morosely sipping a Starbucks
coffee.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
And currently sitting on one of
those stepping stones, is my nest
mate and future business partner—— x
{greeting MARION} {
Marlon.

Marlon nods. Alfie sits next to him_on the steps. They sit
there in silence for a long moment. Marlon stares into his
steaming cup of coffee.

snares _
Black. Lire Lonette's skin. Which
I will never again touch.

Alfie looks TO CAMERA.

ALFIE
I'm afraid you’re not meeting my
homeboy in top form. See, Marlon's
got a problem...

CUT TO:
INT. THE LUCKY BAR - NIGHT
A noisy, packed, downtown club with a cool, diverse
clientele. CAMERA FOLLOWS a MINI—SKIRTED WAITRESS, with a
killer bod, swiveling through the crowd. She's carrying a
tray of drinks which she delivers to a table of Young Guys,
who all look up and all do double—takes.

ALFIE’S VOICE
It’s called Lonette.

REVERSE ANGLE — LONETTE

A beauty. Leaning over to set down the drinks, she flashes a

blinding smile and we FREEZE FRAME.

ALFIE’S VOICE {COMT'D)
And, very recently, it dumped him.

CUT BACK TO:
EXT. ELEGANT LIMO — ALFIE AND MARLON — CONTINUOUS
Alfie and Marlon sit on the steps.

ALFIE
Oh, dear. What was it this time?

HARLOW
Three a.m. desperation call.

ALFIE
How do you live with yourself?

MARLDN
I hung up before she answered. She
didn’t know it was me.

 

2?.

ALFIE
But you know it was you.
{shakes his head)
And I used to think you were
cool...

They both rise and start down the parking ramp. Alfie
attempts to fluff Marion’s normally cool Afro which is dented
on one side.

Marlon slaps his hand away.

MARLOW
I'll get her back.
[forces a grin]
I'm still a radiating hoochie
magnet.

Alfie’s not sold.
INT. ELEGANT LIMO SERVICE - MINUTES LATER

CAMERA is CLOSE ON a short, skinny CHINESE MAM with a loud, //
abrasive voice. '

CHINESE MAW
Alfie, why no Stoli in car
seventeen?!

ALFIE'S VOICE
The little wanker's name is Wing -
my boss and owner of this tragic
operation.

ANGLE BACK as WING approaches Alfie and Marlon who are wiping
down two already gleaming black Town Cars.

Elegant Limo is a modest operation, two Town Cars, two Limos,
a small dispatch office and a row of shabby lockers.

WING
Wipe down car good.

Alfie continues wiping as he SPEAKS to CAMERA.

ALFIE
‘Owner' that is, ‘til Marlon and I
swing a loan and buy it out from
under him. You see, that’s my plan,
Marlon and I--

 

23.

WING
(points to fender]
~- You miss bird poop.

ALFIE
[to CAMERA]
Yep. Wing’s a barking lunatic.

Uuring the above, Wing’s WIFE enters, carrying a ledger and a
pencil. She's pleasant but down-trodden and at the moment,
looks concerned.

ALFIE (CONT'D}
{to comes}
Just check out the way he treats
the little woman.

Mrs. Wing asks her husband something in CHINESE, gesturing to
Alfie, as though telling her husband to be nicer to his
employees.

Wing unleashes a torrent of impatient CHINESE SHOUTING on his
beleaguered wife. Alfie watches, then LOOKS to CAMERA.

ALFIE [CDNT'DJ
Haven't a clue what he’s saying,
but I know it's not good. She’s
given him her best years, cooked
his Ereakin’ chopusuey, helped run
his business, and at one time, I'm
sure he couldn’t wait to rip off
her kimono... But look at ‘em
DOW. . .

Mrs. Wing hurries off, close to tears, with Wing still
berating her.

ALFIE [CONT'Dj
{to CAMERA}
And I'm supposed to respect the
institution of marriage?
(sighs)
There was more love in the Boxer
Rebellion.

Marlon has taken all he can stomach and steps forward.

MARLON
Hey Wing, I think she can hear you
without the volume.

Wing glances at Marlon. Alfie TURNS to CAMERA, anticipating
the worst.

 

29.

ALFIE
Oh man, here comes trouble.

Everything falls silent. Then, Hing wheels on Marlon.

WING
{screaming}
You never mind] It not your
business! She not your wife! She

mine! You fired!

Wing storms off. Marlon is stunned. Mrs. Wing is
speechless. And scared.

Alfie gestures to them both to let him deal with this and
follows after Wing, who’s headed into his office.

ALFIE
Wing, Wing, wait up, mate.
(entering Wing's office]
Look... He meant no disrespect...
[pretending to remember]
Oh... Get this. I got one for

you... A straight Priest with a
dock on his head walks into a gay
bar...

Marlon turns to Mrs. Wing.

MRS. WING
{softly}
Thank you, Mister Marlon.

Marlon and Mrs. Wing watch as_Alfie is SEEN GESTURING
animatedly to Wing BEHIND THE GLASS PARTITION of Wing's
office.

Wing has no reaCtion and Alfie is working harder. Finally,
Wing stares at Alfie for the longest time, his mouth hanging
open, then ERUPTS with HOWLS of LAUGHTER.

Alfie sneaks a wink at Marlon and Mrs. Wing. DISCO MUSIC
BEGINS...

I swear to you, my brother...

ANGLE - ALFIE AND MARLON

Alfie and Marlon move through the trendy crowd, their eyes on
Lonette.

ALFIE
—— I’m not throwing you shade.
it's her night off.

MARLON
I can explain.
{then}
I lied.

INT. LUCKY'S - NIGHT

Alfie and Marlon sit with nearly empty drinks. Alfie wears
glasses and crunches numbers on a cocktail napkin.

ALFIE
(figuring)
—- okay... times 3 months... 7,

carry my 2... equals...
ON ALFIE at a table, crunching numbers on graph paper in a

red file folder. Next to him is Marlon who stares longingly
at Lonette as she waits on someone across the room.

ALFIE (CONT‘DJ

-- times 3 months... I, carry my
2... equals... Okay, wait, wait...
this is brilliant... if we get a
small business loan and calculate
it at...

(figuring)
-- Hold on... One...

He glances up from_his calculations to see Marlon's attention
is riveted on Lonette. Alfie sighs, looks AT CAMERA.

ALFIE [CONT‘DJ
I predicted this. See, Marlon and
Lonette had reached that critical
eighteen—month, Where—Are-Wevsoing—
Whaf—Are—We—Doing-What‘SeHappening—
Here crisis point that rears its
ugly head in every relationship.

ALFIE [CONT'D]
Marlon wanted another eighteen
months to make sure nothing better
was coming his way.

MELON
(re: Lonette)
I fucked up egregiously.

ALFIE

Very nice wordage. I see you're
getting some use out of your
birthday calendar.

[to CAMERA]
So, it ended. Marlon prowled. E
Lonette sulked. By the time be
realized he'd made a mistake and
wanted her back — it was too late.

HARLOW
The iron door has slammed shut.

ALFIE

You've just got to put her out of
your mind. Pretend she got run
over by a truck and died.

(off Marlon's look)
I'm serious. Funeral was this
afternoon. You're all cried out.
Single and ready to move on.

Marlon stares at Alfie.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
What?

HARLOW
Iceman. You ever deal with shit on ,a
any real level?

ALFIE
And why would I want to do a thing
like that? '

MARLOW

Well, that's real solid advice, b.
‘Movc on’ to what?

ALFIE
Other women. Hello? Believe me,
as long as you don’t get crazy
picky, you have no idea what
surprises await——

 

SEXY VOICE
-— Hey, stranger.

32.

Alfie looks up to find an exotic brunette, CAROL standing
next to him. She seems uneasy, a bit hurt or could it be

resentful?
ALFIE
Oh, hello...
CAROL
4- Carol.
ALFIE

Yes, Carol. You look wonderful,
Carol. How have you been, Carol?

CAROL
Fine...

She stands there expectantly.
ALFIE

So. Nice to see you again, Carol.
Be well.

Suppressing some humiliation, Carol hurries off.

checks her out, then looks back at Alfie.

HARLOW
What's up with that?

ALFIE _
Let me put it this way, the show
closed after only one performance.

NARLON
Does a brother even want to know
why?

ALFIE
It would be less than discreet to
tell you.
[short beat]
Hair on the arms.

HARLOW
Excuse me?

ALFIE
Long, dark hair on her arms.

Marlon

 

33.

HARLOW
So? Don’t you have hair on your
arms?

ALFIE

Not as much as her. And I'm not a
bleedin' bird, now am I?

MARLDN
what happened to ‘don’t get crazy
picky'?

ALFIE

{points downstairs]
Try explaining that to Sir
Gigglestick.

WOMAN'S VOICE
So, it's the royal ‘Gigglestick'
that has the unreasonably high
standards?

They look up to see LONETTE has ARRIVED with fresh drinks.
She avoids Marion's gaze.

ALFIE
Yes. All his fault. Even though
he has only one eye, he thinks he's
seen and done it all. Mothing’s
ever good enough for him. He really
is an arrogant little prick.

Lonette laughs, setting Alfie's drink down. She wordlessly
slams Marlon's down, the drink sloshing over the rim of the
glass. Before Marlon can give her a beseeching smile —
Lonette’s gone. Marlon downs his drink...

HARLOW
Can't you talk to her for me...?

Alfie pats Marlon on the shoulder, while looking TO CAMERA..

ALFIE
Classic, isn’t it?

Alfie watches Marlon watching Lonette longingly.

ALFIE [CONT'D]
Now that he can't have her, he
thinks he can’t live without her.
{shakes his head}
Some people are funny...

 

34.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT EVENING

Alfie‘s Town Car pulls into a Handicapped Only slot. A
Senior Couple eyes him suspiciously and Alfie begins an
exaggerated LIMP...

ALFIE'S VOICE
But Marlon's predicament did get me
thinking about my own situation...

INT. JULIE'S HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Alfie, carrying a half—empty bottle of Cristal, bounds up the
stairs.

ALFIE'S VOICE
Maybe it was time to stoke the home
fires.

He opens the door with his key and is dumbstruck to find his
entry blocked by the security chain. Julie APPEARS through
the crack in the door.

ALFIE
Anybody in the mood for a little
Alfie straight-up?

JULIE
This isn't a good time, Alfie.
I've got a lot on my mind.

ALFIE
Oh God, don't you hate when that
happens?
(holds up Cristal}
I brought some ‘Cris.’

JULIE
You brought a half bottle left in
yOur limo by some drunk rapper who
probably drank out of it with his
mouth. Am I supposed to be
flattered?

Alfie’s genuinely thrown, recovers and puts on his best
“little boy" charm...

ALFIE
Baby, you look so warm, soft and

curvy--

 

 

35.

JULIE
(interrupting]
—— Not tonight, Alfred.

ALFIE
What’s wrong, luv? - Tell me...

JULIE
{shrugs}
I don't know - guess I'm just...

She dangles Dorie's LACY RED THONG on the end of her finger
like its' contaminated.

JULIE [COWT'D]
—— seeing red.

Jules tosses the THONG in Alfie’s face and SLAMS the DOOR.
EXT. JULIE’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Alfie steps onto the street, takes a deep breath and a deeper
swig from the Cristal and gets into his Town Car.

He doesn't notice TERRY, walking up to Julie's with an arm-
load of take—out.

INT. THE LUCKY BAR - CLOSING TIME

A Busboy rattles around the empty kitchen. Lonette clears
the last of the glasses from a table. As she moves past the
window:

A FACE APPEARS

Lonette SCREAMS bloody murder — her tray of glasses
shattering on the floor! She looks up terrified, and
realizes it’s only ALFIE, grinning contritely through the
glass.

THE LUCKY BAR — A FEW MINUTES LATER

Alfie trails Lonette, as she moves from window to window,
closing the steel shutters and half-listening.

In the background, the Busboy sweeps up the broken glass.

ALFIE
I mean the poor guy's dying...
Haven’t you tortured him_long
enough?

 

 

36.

LONETTE
He should have thought about all
that before he dipped his wick in
that skanky, fake—boobed ex—ho—
friend of his.

ALFIE
{stops in his tracks)
Those are fake..? I’m devastated.
Next you'll be telling me there's
no Easter Bunny.

Lonette moves behind the bar, takes down a bottle of 1800 and
pours shots.

LONETTE
You were consoling my devastation,
remember?

ALFIE

Right, right...
Alfie sits on a bar stool.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
At any rate, he came crawling back,
didn't he... begging forgiveness
and all that jazz?

LONETTE
[downs her shot}
ﬁnd I'm just supposed to forgive
and forget? Sorry. I’m not that
easy.

ALFIE

Who said you have to forgive him to
take him back?

(downs his shot)
In my opinion — forgiveness is way
over—rated. My motto is, always
harbor a bit of resentment - keeps
you in the power position.

Lonette rolls her eyes, as the Bus Boy sticks his head in
from the Kitchen.

BUS BOY
It's okay if I leave now, Miss?

LONETTE '
Si, graeias, Felix. Hit the lights
on your way out, por favor.

 

 

37.

As he leaves, Felix flicks the switch and the LIGHTS DIM.
Alfie pours himself a shot, downs it and rises.

ALFIE
Wellr I'm off.

Lonette takes out a cigarette. Alfie lights it for her. She
takes a deep drag, blows a lazy smoke ring. He glances out
the window.

ALFIE (cont’d}
It's really pissing down out there.

A CRACK of thunder...
TIME PAS SAGE:
AT THE POOL TABLE

Outside it’s raining. Inside the ashtrays overflow with
butts, the bottle of 1300 is half empty, old school r a b
plays on the juke box and Lonette and Alfie are feeling no
pain. They shoot pool, while playing a game called I’ve
Never.

LONETTE
I've never swam in the Pacific
Ocean.

ALFIE
Me neither.

LONETTE
Shit. Okay, wait a second...
(thinking)

ALFIE
I got one.

LONETTE
Excuse me, it's still my turn.
Wait. Okay, I got one, I’ve never
seen a James Bond movie.

. ALFIE
Get out! Not even a Roger Moore?

IONETTE
I’m.serious.

ALFIE
You can’t he.
{realizes she is}
{MORE}

 

ALFIE {Cont'd}
You are. Now. Brilliant.
{downs a shot)
Five to four. Okay...
(smiles, he’s got one]
I’ve never made my own bed.

LONETTE
Bullshit.
{he shrugs, it's true)
Not even as a child?

ALFIE
I repeat - I have never made my own
bed.

LONETTE

[rolls her eyes)
I'm impressed. Five—five.

38.

Her turn to down a shot. She refills both glasses...

LONETTE {CONT'D}
Here’s one... I've never been with
a white man.

ALFIE
What? And you think I have?!
LONETTE
[laughsj

Just checking. Okay, I've never
had sex with two people in one
night.

Alfie downs another shot.

ALFIE
Six-five, your favor.

Lonette leans over to pour him a refill.

LONETTE
How many’s the most you've had in
one night?

Alfie pops a Dunhill in his mouth, looks over at her.

ALFIE
We’ve stopped playing the game,
haven’t we?

Lonette smiles and lights his cigarette for him.

glances TO CAMERA.

Alfie

 

39.

ALFIE {CONT‘DJ
Am I wrong - or is there a little
innocent flirting going on here?

TIME PASSAGE:
ALFIE AND LONETTE TAKING A BREAK

Lonette sitting on the edge of the pool table, regaling Alfie
with some story...

ALFIE'S VOICE
Like most women, once Lonette got a
little personal attention, she
really came alive. And I thought,
she looks amazingly dishy tonight,
has a real glow about her...

LONETTE
-- Okay, so here’s what I always
wondered — why I never made your
hit list...

ALFIE
-- Okay, here’s why — I took one
look at you and thought — gorgeous,
smart, funny, can balance a dozen
drinks on a tray and still move
like poetry - and way out of your
league, son.

LONETTE
Alfie, you’re so full of shit but
you’re so damn cute, every woman
wants to believe it.

They share a laugh and another round...

ALFIE'S VDICE
Funny how a few drinks and the
right lighting can turn an evening
into an experience.

TIME PASSAGE:
ALFIE AND LOMETTE
A nearly empt ybottle of tequila... Something like Didn’ t I

Blow Your Mind This Time by The Delfonics on the juke box.
Lonette SINGS along, she s got serious chops.

 

 

JD.

ALFIE
Now see, if I had that kind of
talent...

LONETTE

*— Finish the sentence.

ALFIE
... and looked like you, I'd
definitely be strutting my stuff on
a stage somewhere. . .

Feeling emboldened, Lonette SINGS the next couple of bars
directly to Alfie.

LONETTE
Didn’t I Blow Your Mind This Time,
Didn’t I? oh, baby...

They do a little club dance step... Alfie then picks up his
pool one and passes behind Lonette, sizing up the table.

He takes her hand, raises it to his lips, inhales off her
cigarette, then leans in to line up his shot. Lonette shakes
her head, disapproving, bends over him to help... They are
very close.

Alfie stands up, so does Lonette. They look at each other.
Lonette takes a long, cool drag on her cigarette.

ALFIE'S VOICE
Trust me, what happened next was
the furthest thing from my mind
when I dropped by tonight...

Alfie pulls Lonette to him. They look at each other. She
doesn't pull away. Alfie kisses her and they come together,
hungrily, drunkenly.

They break. Alfie looks at her, gauging the moment. Lonette
doesn't look away...

ALFIE'S VOICE [CONT'Dl
T- but then, I thought to myself,
you know what. if it’ll help her
get past her anger towards Marlon,
I owe it to them both, as a friend,
to do whatever I can to help.

Lonette moves to him now and they kiss again.

 

 

41.

ALFIE'S VOICE [CDNT'D]
I find that lately, even lying to
myself comes easily...

With that, Alfie and Lonette start touching and undressing
each other...

TOP SHOT - THE POOL TABLE

Alfie sweeps the halls away and Lonette and Alfie fall IN
SLOW MOTION onto the pool table...

DISSOLTE TD:
ALFIE AND LONETTE - FACE-TDmFACE

Staring silently at each other, catching their breath. It’s
over and neither knows what to say or do. The MUSIC has
stepped. Everything is still. Lonette starts to sit up.

LONETTE f
Oh God, room spinning...

Alfie slides off the pool table, helps her down. They self—
oonsciously and quickly hegin_putting on their clothes,
avoiding eye contact. Alfie pulls on a white undershirt.

LONETTE {CONT'D}
I think that's mine.

ALFIE
(quickly pulling it off,
handing to her)
Sorry... all the excitement...

She laughs without humor, podrs herself a shot. Alfie tucks
in his shirt, takes a deep swig from the bottle and EYES
CAMERA.

ALFIE [CONT'DJ

(to CAMERA]
Don't give me that look. I know it
was wrong, but she’s so sexy and
life's so short. Still, I know I
shouldn't have... Marion's my best
friend. But you know, down deep, I
really think I was trying to help
her make up for what he...

(then, annoyed at himself

more than on]
Oh, never mind. I don't owe you an
explanation. Just bang—offt

 

42.

EXT. NEWSSTANU - FOLLOWING DAY

Alfie pays for vogue Homme, Details, Hello. He seems jumpy,
distracted.

ALFIE'S VOICE
The next morning, I couldn't get
last night out of my mind.

A COLLAGE of RAPID FLASH-CUTS - Alfie and Lonette making
love. Alfie tries to shake off the thoughts.

ALFIE'S VOICE [CONT'Dl
I tried desperately to focus on
something else... Anything else.

The FLEETING LOVEMAKING IMAGES are PUSHED ASIDE by:
RANDOM-UNRELATED CUTS

~~ Alfie's HAND moves up Lonette's skirt... PUSHED ASIDE by
LENNOX LEWIS dropping MIKE TYSON to the canvas...

~— LONETTE'S HANDS tugging Alfie’s shoulders... REPLACED by
HANNIBAL LECTER wearing that mask and laughing...

—— ALFIE AND LONETTE'S MOUTHS MEETING... PUSHED AWAE by QUEEN
ELIZABETH waving to her loyal subjects...

ALFIE’S VOICE {CONT'DJ
Anything to get my mind off my best
friend's incredibly hot,
best—ass—I’ve-ever-seen-in-mv-life
girlfriend.

The IMAGES are all HANGING TOGETHER... fighting for control
of Alfie's mind.

FLASH-CUT — LONETTE

In the throes of passion, she opens her mouth to call Alfie's
name but ANOTHER VOICE comes disconcertingly from her lips.

MARLDN'S VOICE
Alfie!

Alfie is jarred EAEK TO REALITY. He quickly moves down the
street, glancing over his shoulder to see Marlon jogging
toward him.

MARLON
Hey, Alfie!

 

43.

ALFIE
(quickens pace, to CAMERA)
Should I pretend not to hear him?

MARLON
Slow down!

ALFIE
Too late. Dh, Christ...
[turns to Marlon)
Marly, what up?!

HARLOW
Early?

CAMERA TRACKS — Marlon trying to keep up with Alfie.

MARLON (CONT‘DJ
HeyIr listen, I gotta talk to you.

ALFIE
Love to but gotta dash, got a pick-
up at La Guardia.

MARLON
I wanna hear what happened last
night.

They start down the ramp toward ELEGANT LIMDUSINE.

ALFIE
Last night? What do you mean last
night?

MARLON

Son, you know, with Lonette.

We SEE Alfie*s face drop, Marlon doesn’t. They ENTER HING‘S
OFFICE.

WING
You ever hear word ‘knook'!?

Mrs. Wing ENTERSr avoiding eye contact with Wing. She takes
some papers from under a stack on the desk and abruptly
exits. Wing yells after her IN CHINESE but she sticks her
nose in the air, acting as though she doesn't hear him.

WING (CONT'D}
Missus give me silent treatment.

 

 

44.

MARLON
{ignoring Wing, to Alfie)
So, what went down?

ALFIE
(nervous, vamping)
What? Nothing. We had some
drinks...

WING
{in his own world}
Little she know, not hearing
constant——
(makes ‘yapping’ motion]
-- blabber—blabber is gift from
heaven.

Alfie laughs a little too loudly.

ALFIE
Good one, Wing+

Alfie rifles through the booking slips, pulls one, starts
out. Exasperated, Marlon grabs Alfie's arm, turning him
around.

MARION
What happened?

ALFIE
Ah ha, what happened was...
[to CAMERA] _
I'm about to get my jaw rocked.

Alfie stands, resigned now to face the music.

ALFIE {COWT'D}

(to Marlon}
Oh fuck a duck. Look, man, I had a
lot to drink and... Well... I don’t

really remember a lot of what
happened but...

MARLDN
-- Well, you did something to her,
‘cauee she pulled a complete one-
eighty and turned up on my doorstep
at two in the morning saying——

Marlnn's UOICE FAOES, as Alfie’s VOICE RISES and he TURNS to
CAMERA.

 

 

45.

ALFIE
-- that she loved him and if he
needed more time, she underSZood

completely... She wanted him, and
didn't care how long she'd have to
wait.

{proudly}

So, chalk one up to the blokes.
Thanks to me, Marlon had beaten the
rap. He was off Scott-free. It was
a bloody miracle.

(to MARLON]
That is so fantastic, man. And
what did you say?!

MARLON
(ear-to-ear grin]
It’s all good.
(then) f
I asked her to marry me. '

FREEZE FRAME on Alfie. OVER:

ALFIE’S VOICE
Moral of the story - No good deed
goes unpunished.

EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS * DAY

Alfie navigates his Veepa through traffic and pulls up to the
MAENOLIA CAKE SHOP. He parks in the red zone, takes a
shopping bag from_the mini—trunk.

EXT.KINT. MAGNOLIA CAKE SHOP — SAME TIME

A birthday party for Max is in full swing. Max, surrounded
by a few of his Little Friends and their Home, is seated on
Julie's lap having just opened the last of his presents.
Everyone applauds.

Julio looks up and is surprised to see ALFIE peering in the
window.

EXT. MAGNOLIA CAKE SHOP - A MOMENT LATER

Alfie moves away from the window, as Julie steps out,
carrying Max. She's a little testy, distant...

JULIE
Didn't expect to see you here.

Max is excited to see Alfie, he waves with one hand, while
clutching a NEW TEDDY with the other.

 

 

ALFIE .
Hey, Jules. Hey, Mas. I like your
teddy. -

MAX
(garbled)
From Teddy...

ALFIE
Say again?

JULIE
[setting Max down)
From Terry. It’s his birthday
present from_Terry and he won't let
go of it.

Alfie shifts his shopping bag to the other hand, holds it
casually behind his back.

ALFIE
Oh really. Great. Wall. Happy
Birthday, little man.

MAX
Happy Birthday, Alfie!

Alfie and Julie exchange an uncomfortable look, moved by ,
Max's silly adorableness.

ALFIE
So... Terry, huh? You two an item
now?

JULIE

You need a haircut.

ALFIE
Nice avoiding of the question.

JULIE
I learned from the master.

Alfie nods. Touche. Just then, TWO HOTTIES exit the cake
shop. Alfie casually turns away, trying to avoid them. Too
late.

HOTTIE
Hey, Alfie.

ALFIE
Hi, Sasha.

 

 

47.

SASHA ,
Thanks for never calling back.
ALFIE
[half-wawei
Right... Sure... Sorry...
[to Julie)
Yeah, well...
JULIE
Yeah, well...

Terry appears in the doorway.

TERRY
C’mon guys, cake time.

JULIE
Be right in.

Terry hesitates, then turns back inside. Everyone feels
uncomfortable except Max who is delightfully oblivious.

JULIE [CONT T D}
(polite only)
You want to come in for the cake?

ALFIE

Nah, I should get back to work.
Just wanted to, you know, put in an
appearance.

(reaches for his wallet,

pulls out some bills}
Look I... uh, I didn't know what to
get so um, you know...

[holds out money)

JULIE
You’re giving a child cash?

ALFIE
Oh... Not good? All right, then...
[rubs Max's head)
Have a happy, Max.

Alfie turns to go.

MAX
Poem, Alfie.

Alfie turns back, hesitates, looks to Julie, who shrugs.

 

43.

MAX {CGNT'DJ
For my birthday.

ALFIE
Okay, something quick.

Alfie drops to one knee next to Max.

ALFIE [CDNT'D]

Here’s one my step—mum used to tell
me...

(reciting, softly]
Today’s my birthday, three years
old I am... I had for breakfast egg
as well as jam... I chose the cake
we had for dinner too... This
afternoon I’m going to the zoo...
Now isn’t that too grand fer
anything! Aﬁne is a birthday fit
for any king.

Alfie glances up at Julie, but she looks away...

JULIE
{to Max]
We have to go in, Sweetie, your
pals are waiting.

Alfie stands uncomfortably, odd-man-out.

ALFIE
Yeah, okay...

Julie lifts Max and heads back inside.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Be well.

Baffled, Mas starts crying, looking back at Alfie, over
Julie's shoulder.

ALFIE - ALONE ON THE STREET
From inside, the Kids SING “Happy Birthday} Dear Max”. Alfie

opens the shopping bag and looks down at the stuffed TEDDY he
bought Max. A ribbon is tied around its neck.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Alfie's Vespa roars through traffic a bit recklessly. Alfie
flirts with every PRETTY WOMAN he passes.

 

49.

ALFIE'S VOICE
Resilience - The ability to readily
recover after disappointment or
loss.

He deftly avoids colliding with a passing GARAAGE TRUCK and
turns TO CAMERA with a cocky smile.

ALFIE
The capacity to spring back.

BLACKOUT:
OVER BLACK

ALFIE'S VOICE
New word for the day...

ALFIE'S "WORD FUR THE DAY” CALENDAR

Alfie's HAND rips off a page, revealing today’s word is:
HEDONISM.

ALFIE .
Hedonism — The belief that
obtaining pleasure is the true
meaning of life. Hmmm... Reminds
me of someone I used to know...

Alfie raises an eyebrow TO CAMERA.
MONTAGE — MUSIC OVER
—— CLOSE ON ALFIE, a contented smile on his face.

ALFIE'S VOICE
Understand, I wasn't looking to
replace Julie...

ANGLE BACK to see he's stretched out on a massage table, a
skimpy towel covering his skimpy butt, receiving a loving
massage from a loving Masseuse. A SCREEN surrounds the
massage table.

ALFIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Tr I just wanted to_get back to the
simple life — women-who meant
nothing to me...

AKGLE — OUTSIDE THE SCREEN

There’s a GAP of several inches between the floor and the
bottom of the screen.

 

 

 

MASSEUSE {0.8.1
You can roll over now, Mr. Elkins.

ALFIE {0.5.}
{exaggerated formality}
Why, thank you, Miss Wilcox.

We WATCH the MASSEUSE’S FEET DISAPPEAR upwards as she climbs
onto the table with Alfie.

—— ALFIE struts past a long line of hipsters waiting to get
into a CHIC NIGHTSPDT. He SPEAKS to CAMERA.

ALFIE (CONT'DJ
Now, on the scene...

 

A novnonsense, PLAIW JANE, wearing a headset and holding a l
clipboard, guards the entrance along with Two Bouncers.
Spotting Alfie, she lights up and instantly unhooks the
velvet rope. ,

ALFIE (CDNT'D)
—— you never want to be standing on
the wrong side of a velvet rope.
So I clocked in a bit of O.T. with
a petite nightclub manager called
Uta...

- ALFIE and UTA in AW ALCOVE, behind a waist—high
partition... furiously making out. As Uta, still wearing her
headset, sinks down and OUT of FRAME, Alfie turns TO CAMERA.

 

ALFIE {CONT'D}
I know — you're thinking, not up to
the lad's usual standards, and I
must admit I am feeling a bit of a
mustache at this particular
moment...

A PRETTY ERUNETTE passes...

ancestor r I !
Hi, Alfie... I dumped Robby.

ALFIE
{waves}

Fab... I’ll ring you.

-- ALFIE weaves through the BEAUTIFUL CROWD...

 

 

Sl.

ALFIE (CONT'D)
And to think, somewhere in the
world people are going to bed
horny. Sad.

Es waves to the DJ as he passes LEGGT TYPES who smile ooyly.

ALFIE (CDNT'D)

(to CAMERA]
Now, as a heat-seeking bachelor, I
live by a few simple rules. My
Alfie Elkins weltanscbauung —
calendar word - meaning credo or
philosophy - can be summed up by
the only bit of advice my old man
ever gave me...

Alfie grins first to the Girls, then TO CAMERA.

ALFIE [CONT'DJ
He said, ‘Son, every time you see a
beautiful woman, just remember,
somewhere there’s a bloke who's
sick of shagging her.’

One BITTER but sexy GIRL watches Alfie strutting.

BITTER GIRL i
Explain to me what everyone sees in '
that Euro—Trash?

Alfie flashes her a blinding smile and Bitter Girl melts.

—— ALFIE is now seated at A BOOTH in the VIP SECTION with two
Hilton Sister wannabes - CHYNA and TONYA.

ALFIE

{to the Girls)
I think it's so unfair how it's
acceptable for a man to be sexually
adventurous, but if a woman wants
to experiment with something...
like say an innocent little threes
way, they're considered a trollcp,
a slut. It's just so wrong.

The Girls nod with indignant agreement. CAMERA MOVES IN on
Alfie drinking and watching the Girls who begin making—out
with each other for his benefit.

 

52.

ALFIE’S VOICE
But, although I was living every
guy's post-modern Rock Hudson
fantasy--

He leans back for a moment, closes his eyes on the sight of
two girls kissing, which ordinarily he would savor.

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'D}
-- something felt a bit ‘off'.

-- In a CHEESY STUDIO APARTMENT, CAMERA DRIFTS PAST an array
of discarded women's clothes and undergarments and Alfie's
neatly folded topwcoat and things. A half-empty bottle or
Jack sits on the end table. CAMERA comes to rest on the BACK
OF A SOFA.

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'D}
-- And throwing myself back into
the old lifestyle didn't go quite
as smoothly as I’d.hoped.

The SOUNDS of building SEXUAL ANTICS, abruptly stop. A heat
and ALFIE‘S HEAD APPEARS at the end of the sofa. He looks
chagrined, reaches for the Jack. CHYNA pops up on one side
of Alfie, eyeing him suspiciously. TOHYA pops up on the
other, also giving him the ‘eyil eye’.

ALFIE
{self—conscious}
Sorry, girls. Don't know what
happened. So unlike me.
FUNEREAL MUSIC begins...
CUT TO:
A FUNERAL ERDCESSIDE
Slowly passing, the coffin laced with flowers...
ALFIE'S VOICE
Unexpectedly, my very best friend,
had fallen... like a soldier on the
battlefield... '

CAMERA EASES BACK to see we are OVER ALFIE'S SHOULDER, as he
looks down on A CEMETAEY from a high window inside:

A STARK WHITE DDCTOR'S EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Alfie turns from.the window To CAMERA. He is sitting on an
examination table. wearing a paper gown.

I face the future without ‘him'.

Unthinkable’.

FLASHBACK TO:
THE BITTER GIRL
Wrapped in a rumpled sheet, BREAKING BITTERLY to CAMERA.

BITTER GIRL
Now I really don't get what
everyone sees in him.

WIDEN to REVEAL ALFIE - at THE OTHER END of the bed,
dejectcdly pulling on his pants, also SPEAKING to CAMERA.

ALFIE
It kept on happening and happening.

CUT BACK TO:
INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - THE PRESENT

Alfie's nervous knee jiggling so wildly he has to quiet it
with both hands.

ALFIE {CosT' D)
*- Or, more accurately, not
happening and not happening.

FLASHBACK TO:
A BUBBLE BATH

TTLT UP to UTA, the gate keeper, luxuriating at one end of
the bubble bath. REVEAL Alfie at THE OTHER END, staring
morosely down into the bubbles. He looks up at a stern,
judgemental Uta.

_ ALFIE {COHT'D}
This never happens. Uta. Honestly.

UTA

That's not the word around town.

Alfie is mortified. Uta's words ECHO us BACK to:

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM — PRESENT

,

The DOOR SNINGS OPEN and DR. RULE, a middleraged,
androgenous, no-ncnsense woman with a busescut and white lab
coat ENTERS. She refers to a clipboard.

DR. KULP
Mr. Elkins? Dr. Kulp.

ALFIE
(to CAMERA}
The penis dostor's a ‘she’ — with a
little ‘he' thrown in.

DR. KULP
SO, I understand you're
experiencing some ED.
(off his look)
Erectile Dysfunction?

ALFIE
Oh. Yes, I have been experiencing a
bit of what you just said.

DR. KUIP
Did it come on gradually?

ALFIE
-— no, no. Very sudden. One
minute I... It... He... was... How
shall I put this * ‘the life of the
party'... And the next...

{he shrugs, hepelesslyj

DR. KULP
[offers her hand]
Not to worry, I'm an
Erectionologist. I specialize in
that area . .

Alfie shakes her hand, a little squeamishly.

ALFIE

I see.

(raises eyebrow to CAMERA}
And why do you suppose she chose,
as her field of interest, the
penis?

[cocks his head)
Envy?

 

55.

DR. KULP
Have you been under any emotional
stress, Hr. Elkins?

ALFIE

Yes, but my fear of Al anda
shouldn’t really affect my wanker,
should it?

(then, to CAMERA]
I suppose I could tell her about
the recent, less—thanecalming chat
I had with Jules...

FLASHBACK TO:
INT. JULIE’S APARTMENT - BALCONY - NIGHT

Julie and Alfie stand outside her closed apartment door.
Julie, looking more relaxed, now has a new very cute, SHORT
HAIRCUT.

ALFIE'E VOICE
I popped over unannounced, and you
know what — she wouldn't let me in.
Kept me at the door.

JULIE
I’m.not angry anymore... I have to
accept that we want different
things... But I can’t see you...

and I can't have you traipsing in
and out of Max's life.

ALFIE
(nods, then)
And so, you and Terry...

She shrugs, checks her watch.

JULIE
Alfie, I’m gonna be_late...
ALFIE
You've changed your hair.
LIE
Um-hmm.
ALFIE

It looks really good.

 

 

56.

JOLIE
(unmoved)
...Okay. Thanks.

ALFIE
[uncharacteristic remorse}
Why did you never do it like that
before? when we were together?

JULIE
Alfie, I've really gotta go.

They look at each other for a moment.

ALFIE
Right. Okay.

She starts to close the door.

ALFIE {CONT'O}

Oh...

(digs in his pocket]
I guess... I won’t be needing this
anymore.

He pulls out his key ring, takes off a REY, hands it to
Julie. She takes the key. Alfie looks in her eyes, sees
nothing, TURNS to CAMERA.

ALFIE (CONT‘D)
Even the old ‘return the key bit'
got no reaction. '
{then}
Have you ever noticed the sudden
chill that comes over a woman when
it’s truly over?

He starts down the stairs.

JULIE
Alfie?
{he turns]
Are you gonna be okay?

ALFIE
{looking up at her}
No worries, I'll be fine. Thanks
for asking.

Alfie forces a smile... FREEZE FRAME. DEER:

 

 

57.

DR. KULP {0.5.}
All righty. Let’s take a gander at
that penis of yours.

INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE — RRESENT

Dr. Kulp slips on a round HEAD MIRROR, flips it down over one
eye and DROPS OUT OF FRAME in front of Alfie, to examine him.
Alfie immediately reacts to her cold hands...

ALFIE

[to CAMERA}
Whatever happened to warming your
hands by the fire?

[then sighs, remembering}
I had to admit, Julie never looked
lovelier than when she didn*t fancy
HLE anymo [B .

He smiles a bittersweet smile. then squirme around a little.

ALFIE ECONT'D)
(to Dr. Kulp 0.5.]
So, what do you think,r Doctor?

DR. RULE-10.5.}
I think it would be helpful if you
stopped squirming, Mr. Elkins.

ALFIE
(to CAMERA}
That’s a hit of a challenge when
she's messing about with Sir——
(then suddenly}
Whoa! Hel—lo!
(eyes widening}
God Save the Queen!

Dr. Kulp RISES ENTO FRAME.

DR. KULP
well, so much for EU.

Alfie’s embarrassed at first, then grins.

ALFIE -
Well done. What a relief. I feel
like Lazarus raised from the dead.
[to CAMERA]

If the ‘Blair Witch’ here can give

me a stiffy, then I should have no

problem keeping it up for my target
demographic. -

 

 

DR. KULP
-- There doesn’t seem to be
anything physiological, so we can
be fairly certain your problem was
stress—related.

ALFIE
{to CAMERA}
Translation: Julie-related. Like I
always say, if they don't get you
one way, they get you another.
{to DR. KULP}
Right then, I'll be off.

He reaches for his honors, failing to see Dr. Kulp's look of

concern.

DR. KULP
Um... However...

Alfie turns...

She steps

ALFIE
—- I did feel something a little
kooky...

to him, drops her HAND OUT OF FRAME.

ALFIE [CONT'D]
—— Kooky? Is that a medical term?

TWO SHOT — ALFIE AND DR. KULP

As she examines him BELOW FRAME, Alfie’s beginning to have a
mild panic attack.

DR. KULP
Any pain here? Tender?

ALFIE
{shakes his head}
W-W-What exactly are you looking

for? Ow!
DR. KULP ALFIE

-- hr. Elkine- -- Please, you’ve got to tell-
DR. KULP ALFIE

—— there’s something-- -- What? Something. What?

 

59.

DR. KULP ALFIE'S VOICE
—~ I thought I felt—— -- thought you felt—-

DR. KULP
-— a lump on your——

ALFIE
[pure panic]
-- Not on my...?!?

Alfie falls straight OUT OF FRAME with a thud.
EXT. STREET r DAY

A light snow falls on Workers hanging the first of the
season's CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS. OVER:

ALEIE’S VOICE
(as if reciting a
Christmas tale)
And so randy young Alfred got an
early Christmas gift...

Alfie hobbles onto the sidewalk, his hands covering his groin
to avoid contact with passing Pedestrians.

ALFIE
(to CAMERA}
-- A penis biopsy.

EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW — DAY

Delighted Children and their Moms crowd the sidewalk, vying
for a peek at a SANTA'S WORKSHOP SCENE being installed in the
store window.

Alfie approaches, his hands still protecting his crotch. He
steps into the middle of the gathered Families to check out
the display, all the while TALKING to CAMERA.

ALFIE
I get my test results in three
days, well five, if you count the

weekend.
{suddenly panics}
Oh, Lord... How am I going to keep

from going bonkers?

{calms himself}
I’ll be fine. I’m a young man.
Shift focus, Alfie.

 

60.

A Pretty Young Mom glances over and notices Alfie looking

sort of spaced and crazed. Alfie gives her his best sexy

smile. The Mom looks down. sees Alfie's hands cupped over
his privates - and immediately yanks her Child away.

Alfie turns and realizes all THE MOMS are now glaring at him

like he’s some sort of perv. He TURNS to CAMERA.

ALFIE (CONT'D}
In the meantime...
(turns, hohhling}
—— perhaps I'd be safer hobbling
home...

He turns and hobbles off...
EXT. ALFIE’S STREET — LATER THAT DAY

Alfie, juggling a bag of groceries and his dry cleaning,
limps up the steps of his building, as Lu Schnitman and her
friend MRS. LIBERMAN are about to exit. Alfie struggles to
open the door for the ladies.‘

MRS. SCHNITMAN
Alfie, dear, what's wrong - you
look like death warmed over.

ALFIE
Slight groinal soccer injury is
all, Lu. Mrs. Liberman, you're
looking well.

He holds the door with great effort and gives a slight pained
how as they pass. The Girls giggle at his gallantry. Alfie

steps sideways through the doorway. It's then he notices:

LONETTE e WAITING IN THE UESTIBULE

LONETTE

Could I speak to you for a sec?
ALFIE

Sure... Of course. Ladies, this is

my friend, Lon——

Eut Lonette has already moved toward the steps. Alfie turns

to the Ladies.

ALFIE (CONT'D)
Sorry... I didn't expect——

Mrs. Schnitman comes close to Alfie, whispers in his ear.

 

61.

MRS. SCHNITMAK
She’s lovely. Good for you dating
an African—American.

Alfie crosses to Lonette, who’s leaning against the front
bannister.

ALFIE
Hey, girl. I've missed you.

Mrs. Schnitman and Mrs. Liberman tippyutoe around them.

MRS. SCHNITMAN
Don't mind us, we're not here, you
two kids keep talking.

MRS. LIBERHAN
Very nice to meet you.

Lonette smiles at the Ladies. When they’re gone, she drops
the smile and turns to Alfie.

ALFIE
So, what have you been——

LONETTE
—— I’m pregnant.

FREEZE FRAME on Alfie...

ALFIE'S VOICE
It seems to me, the problems you
worry yourself sick about,r never
seem to materialize.

DARK CLOUDS
roll across a bleak, grey sky.

ALFIE’S VOICE {CONT'D)
It’s the one’s that catch you
unexpectedly on a Tuesday
afternoon, that knock you sideways.

EXT. FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC - DAY

A grey, rainy morning. Alfie and Lonette stand in front of
the clinic. Alfie, wearing his raincoat, holds an umbrella
between them.

ALFIE’S VOICE
I offered to face the music with
her...

 

62.

They look at each other a moment, then Lonette turns and
heads inside... .

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'UJ
-— but she wanted to go it alone...

INTIEKT ALFIE’S TOWN CAR

The rain has turned to drizzle as Alfie waits in front of the
clinic. _

ALFIE'S VOICE
We both knew if that baby was born
with any pasty white boy features,
it would pretty much mean the end
of Lonette and Marion.

He glances up at the clinic, checks his watch, TURNS to
CAMERA.

ALFIE
Not to mention, your host for the
this evening.

ON THE STREET
Alfie paces.

AIFIE’S VOICE
But, standing there in the rain, I
found myself thinking morbid
thoughts, like ‘Here’s another kid
you'll never get a chance to
know... your own...’

He turns up his collar against the chill.
A HALF-HOUR LATER

Alfie rubs his hands together to stay warm. He tries to
light a cigarette but can't in the drizzle.

BACK IN THE TOWN CAR

Alfie is now smoking, takes a deep drag, leans his head back,
TURNS to CAMERA.

ALFIE
Life can be a bit too much at
times... Still, it beats the hell

out of the alternative.

ALFIE LEANS AGAINST TOWN CAR'S FENDER

..---v.u .-. w w .-\r:-.-H.:~:w .-v-\.—-- .-

 

63.

He glances up as the CLINIC DOOR OPENS and Lonette walks
slowly toward him. She looks shaken. Alfie hurries to meet
her, trying to appear upbeat.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Well, that didn't take long, did
it?

He looks in her eyes, forces a smile. She turns away. Alfie
takes her hand and helps her to the car.

ALFIE [CONT'D)
Your hands are freezing.
{rubs her hands]
Are you... How do you feel?

LONETTE
Empty.

Lonette gets in the car, Alfie opening and closing the door
for her. He stands there for a moment, then TURNS to CAMERA.

ALFIE
That night in the bar, I thought I
was getting something for nothing
but it doesn’t seem to have worked
out that way, does it?

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET e HIGH SHOT — LATER

Alfie's Town Car pulls up and he gets out, opening the door
for Lonette. She gets out and walks the rest of the way home
without even a goodbye. Alfie stands there watching her
disappear in the crowd...

BLACKOUT:
OVER BLACK

ALFIE’S VOICE
I keep having this vision...

INT. MEDICAL LAB — NIGHT

A bespectacled, LAB TECHNICIAN is bent over a microscope,
intensely studying a slide.

ALFIE'S VOICE
That at this very moment, some lab
technician is looking at my slide
and gasping.

The Lab Tech GASES, recoiling at what he sees.

 

64.

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'DJ
And calling over his mates...

Other Lah Technician’s quickly crowd around him.

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'DJ
-- to observe this tragic
specimen.

The other Lab Techs all GASP in horror as well.
CUT TO:
LU SCHNITMAN
In her LIVING ROOM, wearing a frilly robe and nightgown.

MRS. SCHNITMAN
You're not going to die, honey
hunch. '

Alfie sits across from Lu, rumpled and anxious in his pj's.
Lu drops a marshmallow into the cup of hot chocolate Alfie’s
holding, follows it with a splash of brandy and stirs it for
him. -

MRS. SCHNITMAI‘C [CONT'D]
If it's anything, which I'm sure
it's not, you can rest assured they
caught it early. My friend Marge
Skolnick, God rest her——
{catches self)
Oh, never mind. Go on, Alfie.

Alfie puts down his hot chocolate, overly anxious, wrings his
hands.

ALFIE
Because the thing is, Lu, when I do
go, I'd like to go out on a higher
note, if you know what I mean... I
don’t want to feel too many--
{searching for the word)

MRS. SCHHITMAN
—— Regrets, sweetheart?

ALFIE
Yeah. Exactly. Regrets.
(TURNS to CAMERA}
She's so warm and compassionate.

ALFIE {cont'dj

Why can't she be a rich, curvy
Norwegian babe with pert, up"

[to himself)
All right, stop.

(to LU}
There are things I still want to do
with my life, Lu.

MRS. SCHNITMAN
Like what, lovey?

ALFIE
Well, that’s part of the problem...
I'm not exactly sure... But, if it

turns out tomorrow that I even have
a future, it’s a sign changes need
to be made...

MRS. SCHHITMAN
I'm sure you’ll find your way,

Alfie.

ALFIE
I appreciate you letting me ramble
on, Lu... There aren't many people

I can turn to at two in the a.m.
Lu gives him a comforting smile.

MRS. SCHNITHAN
Oh, please, everyone adores you.

ALFIE
I don't think I’m winning many
popularity contests these days, Lu.

MRS. SCHNITMAN
Well, from what I've seen, you I
certainly have your share of female
admirers. Present company
included.

Alfie gives Lu a hug. She’s plotzing.

until we come to AlFIE, the youngest geezer in THE DOCTOR’S

WAITING ROOM by thirty years. His nervous knee is bobbing
like gang—busters.

 

 

66.

He fidgets for a heat, than is on his feet, crossing to the
ICY NURSE, at the receptionist station. She’s a cool
Hitchcock blonde. Before he can speak:

ICY NURSE
For the millionth time, Mr. Elkins,
when we know the results, you’ll
know the results.

ALFIE
For the millionth time, Nurse,
since I’ve nothing better to do
than find out whether I'm gonna
live or die — think I’ll hang.

He crosses hack to his seat, picks up a magazine, leafs
through it, then glances out the window.

HIS VIEW - ANOTHER FUNERAL

It’s raining and the Mourners are all hidden under an array
of BLACK UMBRELLAS as they toss rose petals onto a coffin.

CLOSE ANGLE e ALFIE
He turns from the funeral TO CAMERA.

ALFIE
One wonders who’d show up to toss
petals on my coffin. Really,
who — Max? Who’d drive him?

The Icy Nurse glances over at him, then looks away. Alfie
can't help himself. He*s back at her desk like a shot.

ALFIE [CONT' D]
Nurse, I saw the way you looked at
me just then and if you already
know something and they've asked
you not to tell me——

ICY NURSE ALFIE
—— Mr. Elkins... -- I can handle it...
ICY NURSE ALFIE
—" Mr. Elk-- F- I‘m.right, aren’t I?
ICY NURSE;
(daggersl

There-is-ne-n_ews!

 

6?.

Alfie closes his eyes regaining his composure, TURNS to
CAMERA.

ALFIE
I'm gonna be fine. I just feel it.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Alfie enters to find one urinal “Out of Order". The other _
occupied by a nattily dressed-old guy, JOE. /

JOE
I’ll be a minute. Or ten.

ALFIE
Take your time.

JOE
Don’t have a choice. I used to
pee, now I trickle. I’m Joe.
What's your name?

ALFIE
Me? Alfie.

We HEAR a thin trickle of pee in fits and starts from Joe.

JOE_
So, how you doin', Alfie?

ALFIE
Hangin' in... you?

JOE
Shitty.

ALFIE
Yeah, me too.
(then)
I like the hole tie, Joe.

JOE
Thanks. I have a collection.

He’s still peeing. Alfie, having a bit of trouble holding it
in, smiles politely at Joe.

JOE {CONT'Dj
When you're old, you learn to be
patient.
{then}
Yeah, used to be I had no time for
nothing. Go, go, go.

 

 

68.

ALFIE
I know the feeling...

JOE

The wife was always hocking me to
take a little vacation, Hawaii,
Reno... I always said, ‘Next year,
Evie, next year, I got too much on
my p1atter...‘ Always thought I’d
have more time... Then one Sunday
night, she takes the pot roast
outta the oven, yells, ‘Soup’s
on’... and slumps to the kitchen
floor. Just like that.

{snaps his fingers}
head as disco.

ALFIE
Geez, I’m_sorry, Joe.

JOE

I tried picking up the pieces. Even
went to Waikiki alone on the eight-
day cruise package she was always
yakking about. Couldn’t get Evie
outta my mind. I kept thinking how
she would’ve loved the islands...
the trade winds, the flowers...

{laughs to himself]
-— and those blue drinks.

ALFIE
I think you had what they call a
bit of ‘contrition.’
(to CAMERA}
Calendar word.

JOE

You married, Alfie?
ALFIE

No, Joe.
JOE

How come? You a tough fit?

ALFIE
It's just not on my.radar.

JOE
Two things I learned in life — find
someone to love and live every day
as though it's your last...

{MORE}

 

69.

JOE (cont'd)

{zips up}
She’s all yours, Alfie. Enjoy.

Joe crosses to wash his hands;

JOE [CONT'DJ
If you're ever bored or feel like
schmoozing, give me a holler...
[about to hand Alfie his

card, stops)
Ah... you'll never call.

ALFIE
{not really meaning it}

Maybe 1 will .

JOE
Good, we'll go to a rave together.

Alfie laughs, takes Joe's card.

ALFIE
Thanks, Joe. And, sorry about

Evie.

Joe looks off wistfully, starts out, stops, turns back.

JOE
We weren’t all that fond of each

other. but we were very close, if
you know what I mean...

ALFIE
I think I do.

Joe pats Alfie on the shoulder and leaves. HOLD on Alfie

watching him go. OVER:

ALEIE'S VOICE
I've been thinking a lot about God

and death lately...

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Beat. Beat. The DOOR OPENS and

A dreary, drizzly day.
He lifts

Alfie trudges out, head hanging, shoulders sagging.
his head slightly, looks mournfully AT CAMERA:

ALFIE

in Bible Class is true, I'm really

in for it.

for joy)

70.

ALFIE (Gont'dj
But I won’t be partying with
Lucifer any time soon — ‘Cause my
test results came back NEGATIVE!
I'm.gonna live!

Suddenly he's Gene Kelly, sans umbrella. He hops over the
railing — splashing feet first in a HUGE PUDDLE.

ALFIE {COHT'DJ
Look at that, I’ve ruined my Prada
loafers!

Alfie splashes joyfully around in the puddle, oblivious to
the stares of onlookers. He suddenly stops, SPINS around to
CAMERA.

ALFIE (CONT'D)
Don't think I've forgotten my oath
to completely change my life!

A CLAP of THUNDER, LIGHTENING streaks across the sky.

ALFIE [CONT'D)
Yep, health is now priority number
one, business plan moves onto the
fast track and from this day
forward - no more meaningless sex!

Alfie spreads his arms wide and as he opens his mouth to
drink in the RAIN, we HEAR a SCREAM of ECSTAEE.

MATCH CUT TO:
THE ICY BLDNDE NURSE - FREEZE FRAME

Half out of in her crisp white uniform and half out of her
mind, she’s caught in a frozen moment of unbridled ecstasy...

ALFIE’S VOICE
-— All right, all right... one
little piece of unfinished
business...

The IMAGE POPS to LIFE and the Icy Nurse BOWLS like a
Banshee...

ALFIE'S VOICE (CONT‘Dl
You have to admit, this one
desperately needed a good thawing
out.

WIDEN to REVEAL the Icy Nurse and Alfie going at it, after
hours, on top of HER RECEPTIONISTS' DESK.

 

71.

The Icy Nurse claws Alfie's back, writhing and screaming and
generally going nuts. Alfie steals a guizzical LOOK to
CAMERA.

ALFIE
But, what’s up with all the racket?
I mean, if it’s for my benefit,
she’s wasting her breath.
(SCREANS grow louder}
mo ego requires this much positive
feedback.

The Icy Nurse reaches an EAR-PIERCING ORGASM...

ICY NURSE
on, Mr. Elkins r you rock!!!

INT. TOWN CAR - MOVING s DAY

Alfie, wearing a snappy new suit and his chauffeur's cap,
maneuvers the Town Car through traffic. He SPEAKS to CAMERA,
while occasionally checking something in his rear—view
mirror.

ALFIE
Minor detour... Back on track and
cracking on.

He glances in the rear—view.
HIS VIEW — THROUGH MIRROR

Curled up in his backseat is LIZ, a voluptuous, some would
say over—ripe, all would say sexy, woman in her late forties,
early fifies... She has a full, throaty smoker's voice and is
decked out in versace.

Liz nuzzles WES, a tanned, tight, manicured, business exec in
his fifties. They both roll calls, Wes’ hand absently
resting on Liz's thigh.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
{to CAMERA)
New slate. New beginning...

Liz looks up from her cell phone, catches Alfie in the rear-
view. Alfie flashes his patented smile, Liz looks away,
continues talking into the phone...

EXT. HENRI BENDEL — DAY

The Limo pulls up and Alfie pops out, smartly OPENING the
DOOR for Liz and Wes.

 

72.

WES
[snapping phone shutL
What's your name?

ALFIE
Alfie, sir.

WES
Wait here, Alfie.

ALFIE
Nay I ask how long you’ll be?

WES
{turns back} -
Why, you got someplace to go?

ALFIE
No, I just thought I’d grab a cup
of tea across the——

WES
~~ You know what, why don't you
stay put.

Wes starts after Liz.

ALFIE
I like your suit, guv.

Wes gives Alfie a dismissive look, then follows Liz into
Henri Bendel. Alfie “flips"r Wes off, behind his back. Liz
glances over her shoulder and catches the gesture, breaks a
tiny smile. Alfie pops a lollypop in his mouth...

EXT. HENRI BENDEL - AN HOUR LATER

Alfie leans against the Town car watching Christmas shoppers
hurry past. He checks his watch, makes a decision, clicks on
the hazard lights and drops the lollypop stick in the trash.

INT. HENRI BENDEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

CLOSE ON THREE IMAGES of LIZ seen in a three-way mirror.
She's modeling a clingy low—cut cocktail dress while a Chic
Salesgirl watches admiringly from the sidelines.

LIZ
Yay or nay?

Wes looks up from his The Hall Street Journal but before he
can answer: '

 

T3.

ALFIE (0.8.)
A definite ‘yay'.

Wes sees ALFIE'S REFLECTION approaching in the mirror,
pulling off his chauffeur's cap.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
{as he passes Wes}
Stunning, wouldn’t you agree, sir?

WES
(annoyed)
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you to wait
by the car?
ALFIE

I reckoned the lady might need a
hand with her packages.

Liz feels Alfie’s-unabashed male appreciation wash over her.

LIZ
(poses for Alfie)
Yay? You think?

ALFIE
I do... With one minor...
{gesturing he wants to
adjust something}
-- May I?

LIZ
—— You may.

ALFIE
—— adjustment...

Alfie moves close to Liz, gently tugging the neckline
revealing a small TATTOO of a TINY HEART with the name
PABLO S encircling it on her breast.

LIZ
Bullfighter. Another lifetime.
Don't ask.

Alfie glances at the tantalizing view of her cleavage, then
COCKS an EYE to CAMERA.

ALFIE
[to CAMERA)
Fifty if she’s a day. Rut you know,
they say ‘fifty’s the new forty!r
and is she not the living proof?

T4.

ALFIE [ContTdJ
I mean' have a look - Cleavage like
the Holland Tunnel.

{to LIZ}
Better?
LIZ
Much.
ALFIE

You are so right to trust VErsace.
A pair of hot pink Jimmy Choo
stilettos and you're good to go.

Alfie nods to the Salesgirl who hurries off in search of the
Jimmy Choo’s.

LIZ
Well, aren't you Mister Full
Service... '

Wes snaps shut his cell—phone and glares.

ALFIE
He’s getting a bit pissy, isn't he?

LIZ
He’s fine. It‘s good for him.

ALFIE
Husband’s a bit older than you.

LIZ
He's not my husband.

ALFIE
But he's wearing a ring.

LIZ
I didn't say he wasn't someone
else's husband.
Alfie laughs, a gal after his own heart.
THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - LATER

The Town Car pulls up and a Bellman steps forward, opening
the door for Liz and Wes.

Alfie hustles around, pops the trunk, and begins handing
shopping bags to a $econd Bellman. He finishes, turns,
holding out his card to Liz.

 

ALFIE
If you should require my services
in the future...

Liz takes the card, joins Wes.

ALFIE fCC-NT' o)
(calling after them)
Happy Christmas... Sir... Ma’am.

LIZ
Back at ya, outie.

Alfie watches Liz move toward the hotel entrance. She offers
Alfie a quick turn of the head and a wink. FREEZE FRAME.
OVER:

ALFIE'S VOICE
Now that, I thought to myself, is a
real woman. Smart, sexy... And you
saw the little flirt that went down
between us.

Alfie gives Liz a parting wave, then TURNS to CAMERA.

ALFIE

It makes me think... If a woman of
that caliber takes notice of a
bloke like me... perhaps I’ve been
selling myself a bit short...

{starts toward Limo}
And that was it, in a flash I had
my New Year's resolution...

(stops. turns To CAMERA)
Aim higher.

EXT . ELEGANT LIEU - DRY
Alfie's Town Car zooms down the ramp. OVER:

WING'S VOICE
Futile!

INT. ELEGANT LIED DEPOT

Wing is FACING AND RANTIHG behind Alfie who stands in the
foreground, FACING CAMERA.

WING
Desperate! Doomedl Desolate!

 

ALFIE
Gave him a calendar for
Christmas — large mistake.
[to WING}
What's got you so bleak, mate?

WING
You soul brother!

Wing tosses a package to Alfie.
on THE STREET - OUTSIDE ELEGANT LIMO — MOMENTS LATER

Alfie leans against a wall reading a letter and holding a
small wrapped gift.

ALFIE’S VOICE

As it turns out, Wing was bummed
because Marlon had quit. He and
Lonette decided, on the spur of the
moment, to slope and move upstate.
Somehow, Lonette convinced Marlon
it would be too painful to say our
‘gocd—byes‘r in person.

(sighs, resigned)
Yeah, right...

As Alfie unwraps the gift.
FLASHBACK TO:
A BEACH - AT SUNSET - ALFIE'S MEMORY

hlfie, Marlon and Lonette, bundled up in blankets, around a
bonfire - drinking beer, acting crazy and cracking each other
up. OVER:

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'D)
In the letter, Marlon called me his
‘best mater and apologized for
bailing on our little ‘take-over’
scheme. He said his_who1e thing
now was to make Lonette happy — and
that I had a standing invite to
drop by anytime...

The Three Friends sling their arms around each other and the
IMAGE FREEZES. PULL OUT to:

ALFIE - HOLDING THE GIFT

 

VT.

It's a sea shell-encrusted FRAME with the PHOTOGRAPH of
ALFIE, MARLON and LONETTE captured at that moment on the
beach - laughing, their arms around each other.

WIDE SHOT - ALFIE ON THE STREET
Alone, holding the framed photo.

ALFIE'S VOICE (CONT'D}
I was feeling a bit abandoned...
And to make matters worse, it all
dove-tailed into the second
loneliest night of the year...

Softly, we HEAR Steve Tyrell's soulful version of Have
Yourself'A marry Little Christmas.

CHRISTMAS EVE IN MANHATTAN
New York in all its holiday splendour.

ALFIE'S VOICE
—— Christmas Eve.

—— Doorways adorned with garlands... Wreaths of holly and
strings of twinkling lights hung on snow-dusted shops.

ALFIE’S VOICE (CONT'D}
A night that brings on those
familiar festive feelings of
hopelessness, anguish and despair.

-- Snow flutters down on happily, bundled—up Upper East
Siders — hurrying to festivities.

ALFIE’S VOICE [COKT'D}
Not a good time to be flying solo.

INT. ALFIE’S TOWN CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

INT. ALFIE'S TOWN CAR - MOVING — NIGHT

Passing The Empire State Building wrapped in twinkling
Christmas lights. Alfie LOOKS at CAMERA as he drives.

ALFIE
Personally, I've always suspected
that everyone was having a far
merrier Christmas than me. Not
that I ever actually had a
Christmas, but that’s a whole other
Dickens story.

A LOUD male WHISTLE interrupts him and Alfie raises a finger
TO CAMERA.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Excuse me.

He turns to see:
ALFIE'S VIEW — TRAVELING SHOT - CITY STREET

A boisterous group of BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS in their late 20’s,
waving for Alfie to pull over. Someone drops a bottle to the
sidewalk where it shatters.

YOUNG GUY IN SANTA HAT
Taxi!

Fits of bent-over laughter, some random carolling. They're
drinking from plastic cups, practically spilling on each
other, all majorly buzzed. Alfie lowers his window...

ALFIE
Sorry, mates, against the law for
me to transport more than——

Alfie stops mid—sentence, unable to speak, as one of the
young women who has been facing in the opposite direction
turns toward him.

HER NAME IS NIKKI ”Mr

And she’s a tall, willowy, drop-dead blonds. She gives Alfie
a smile that could melt Alaska.

 

19.

ALFIE'S VOICE
And there she was...

Snow swirls around her... BACKLIT by twinkling Christmas
lights, she is nothing short of a vision. CHORAL MUSIC rises.

ALFIE’S VOICE {CONT'D}
—— My Christmas Miracle.
Remember... 1Aim higher'?
(to THE GROUP, voice
cracking}
Hop in, then.

They all rush the Town Car, Nikki leans her head in the
window...

NIKKI
Thanks for saving us, I was
freezing my little...
{picking her word}
--tush off. '

ALFIE
No worries. A bit crowded back
there, why don’t you——

NIKKI

(reading his mind]
*— Good idea. Why don’t I.

Nikki slides into front seat, while the others pile in back.
Alfie glances down, could there be a shorter mini-skirt on
planet earth? Could there be longer legs?

EXT. TOWN CAR - HIGH SHOT — TRAVELLING — NIGHT

OVER we HEAR everyone singing'“I Saw Mommy Schtupping Santa

ALFIE
Consider it my gift, darling.

That’s what the season's all about,
isn’t it, the joy of giving?

KEV

Loathe.

GIRL #1

NIKKI
Oh, I love them.
{to Alfi33
Don't you... what’s you name?

ALFIE
Alfie. Absolutely.' Adore.

Nikki is punohing_ RADIO BUTTONS, screwing up his pre sets the
way Dorie did earlier. Every station is playing HOLIDAY
TUNES. Alfie starts to say something, catches himself.

Nikki fires up a joint and gives him an inviting smile.

NIKKI
Wanna abuse a little substance,
Alfie?

 

El.

ALFIE
No thanks, I’m trying to quit.
{glances at beautiful
Nikki)
One hit.

Nikki settles on Little Saint Nick by The Beach Boys, as
Alfie takes a long pull on the joint and holds it in...
And MUSIC RISES...

EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT {MUSIC OVER)
The Town Car rolls through the nearly empty city streets.
INT. ARTIST'S LOFT - NIGHT

A full-tilt bash. Packed with young, arty types. Huge
Pollack—like canvases, with bold streaks and splotches of
color, cover the walls. Strings of vintage Christmas lights
everywhere. Sixties holiday MUSIC blasts, possibly a Mel
Tormeinp Hop mix. The crowd, mostly couples, laugh, dance,
make-out, drink too much...

CAMERA FINDS Alfie taking a couple of eggnogs from the
Bartender. He turns to see:

NIKKI - SURROUNDED BY ADMIRERS
She winks at Alfie.

ALFIE’S VOICE
There’s an expressicn the Yanks
often use, ‘Go with the flow’...

BACK TO ALFIE

SPEAKING to CAMERA as he moves through the crowd, holding the
drinks.

ALFIE
She invited me into the party and
although I had a dose of the
holiday blues, when a bird of this
mind—blowing caliber comes along,
it's best to get going and start
flowing...

Alfie arrives with the drinks, handing one to Nikki and
accidently spilling a bit down the side of his glass in the
process. As Nikki leans in and licks the cggnog off the side
of Alfie's glass, he TURNS to CAMERA.

 

82.

ALFIE (CONT'D]
Maybe it was the late hour. Maybe
it was the heavily-spiked eggnog...

ALFIE AND NIKKI — STANDING UNDER A DOORWAY

Talking, laughing, drinking.... Suddenly, Nikki realizes they
are standing under a sprig of MISTLETOE... And she gives
Alfie a sweet kiss. He glances TO CAMERA.

ALFIE [CONTTD]
Maybe it was simply a mutual
desperate desire to have ourselves
a Merry Little Christmas...

ALFIE AND NIKKI - DANCING

It’s getting romantic, they're wrapped around each other,
moving fluidly.

ALFIE'S VOICE
Whatever the reason, ‘hooking upr
has never gone more swimmingly,
until...

They are about to kiss, this time without the aid of
mistletoe, when:

A DEEP MALE VOICE _~’H
May I have this dance? "’

Alfie turns to see a handsome MIDDLE-EASTERN GUY, standing
before them. He’s tall and slickly dressed... evorything's
shiny — shirt, tie, suit, forehead. He has a monetache and
wears tinted glasses.

ALFIE
No thanks. But sweet of you to
ask.

FARDOZ

[ignores Alfie)
—— I need to speak with you, Nikki.

NIKKI
Farooz, I'm.dancing.

FAROOZ
(a step forward}
Undance. We need to talk.

 

83.

ALFIE
(raises his hands}
Really, don’t let me--

NIKKI
He's my en-fiance.
{introducing}
Farooz - Alfie.

FARDOZ
{correcting}
I'm her fiance. I did not agree to
the ex part.

Alfie gives CAMERA a LOOK... Nikki takes him aside.

NIKKI
It's not what you think, English.
I promise you. We're so over.

ALFIE
...think you better'explain that to
the bloke in the shiny suit.

NIKKI
Oohh... ‘bloke’. You’re so cute.
(holds up five fingers}
Give me five. Believe me, I can
turn a guy off as easily as I can
turn him on.

She squeezes Alfie’s hands, gives him a smile... She's too
gorgeous. Alfie STEPS away and then EABBS BACK within
earshot, as Nikki and Farooz carry on a heated, clenched
teeth argument behind him...

FARDUZ
-— you're full of bullshitl Who
else will ever put up with you?

NIKKI
That’s really a great way to win me
back.
EAROOZ
I want an explanation, Nikki!
ALFIE
{to CAMERA}

You want an explanation? How’s
this — she’s had her fill of you,
Slick. Move on. You look rich,
I’m sure you can buy someone else.

 

84.

NIKKI
-- plus I can't deal with the drama
and the possessiveness...

FAROUZ
You are outrageous!

NIKKI
Hey, calm down. Maybe you should
take something...

FARUOZ
Like what a a gun to shoot you?

ALFIE
{to no one}
I’ll be at the bar.

TWENTY MINUTES LATER - AT THE BAR

The Bartender hands Alfie a fresh drink. The party has
thinned out. Nikki and Faroos are not around.

THIRTY MINUTES LATER

Alfie's glass is empty and the party has now dwindled way
down. He looks around. Nikki and Farooz are still not to be
found. Alfie asks the Bartender for one for the road and
grabs his overcoat.

INTKEKT STAIRS e MOMENTS LATER

Alfie heads down the stairs, sipping the fresh eggnog and
TALKING to CAMERA.

ALFIE
A lesson to us all, never--

A DOOR BANGS OPEN somewhere above and HIGH HEELS CLACK
frantically down the stairs. _Alfie looks up, and sees Nikki
running down the stairs. She grabs his arm, without breaking
stride, pulling him along with her.

NIKKI
Quick... we gotta get out of Dodge!

Above them, the door BANGS OPEN again!
ON THE STREET - CONTINUOUS -.NIGHT
Alfie and Nikki hit the street at full bore... slide across

the icy sidewalk. Alfie presses his remote, unlocks the
doors and he and Nikki scramble inside.

 

85.

Alfie starts the engine and is about to pull away when
there's a DEAFENING CRASH. Alfie looks up.

HIS VIEW - FARDOZ

Landing on the WINDSHIELD, his face a mask of rage. Alfie
takes off, Farooz hanging on to the wiper blades for dear

FAROOZ

FLIES into a SNOW BANK.

NIKKI
You may be fucking... but you won't
be sorry.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - HIGH SHOT - A HALF HOUR LATER

Blanketed in snow. CAMERA MOVES TOWARD the Town Car parked
under a street lamp.

ALFIE’S VOICE
After a remark like that and
knowing she was suddenly ‘homeless

highly out of character...

Alfie and Nikki are furiously making out in the back seat.

—— Nikki, wearing glitter eye—shadow, sips a Martini and
stares smoldering INTO CAMERA.

ALFIE'S VOICE (CONT‘DJ
She was also smart...

—— Nikki and Alfie in bed - both concealed by NEWSPAPERS.
He's reading Hello, she’s behind The New York Times.

ALFIE’S VOICE (CONT'D)
Fun...

-- Nikki and Alfie lying half-naked on top of the KITCHEN
TABLE, surrounded by the remains of Italian take—out...

ALFIE'S VOICE (CONT'D!
Oh, and did I mention, she makes a
cracking good bed?r

—— Alfie's sso — FOR once — psstc'rLr sass.

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'DJ
I began to wonder - Could this be i
‘the one'...

—— Alfie and Nikki SLOW DANCING.

ALFIE'S VOICE [CONT‘D}
-~ who finally holds my attention?

Another Stunning Elonde passes. flashing Alfie a comely
smile. Alfie looks her way for a fleeting moment, his gaze
almost instantly returning to Nikki... As they continue to
glide across the floor...

CUT BACK TO:

INT. SWANKE NIGHTSPOT - THE ERESENT

Ten... Nine... Eight... The Revellers COUNTING DOWN to the
New Year. Seven... Six... Five... Alfie and Nikki pick up
flutes of champagne. Four... Three... Two...

THE CLOCK ON THE WALL

The second hand hits midnight! Everyone CHEERS, blowing
noise-makers, kissing one another and singing “Auld Lang
Syne”...

ALFIE AND NIKKI

Nikki kisses Alfie with all she's got, writhing up against
him, way over-the-top... '

When they break Nikki CLINKS Alfie's glass a bit too hard and
both GLASSES SHATTER. FREEZE FRAME on SHATTERING GLASS in
mid-air. OVER:

ALEIE’S VOICE
In every doomed relationship, there
comes, what I like to call, The Oh—
Oh moment...

 

89.

Alfie still holding the jagged CHAMPAGNE FLUTE, TURNS to
canoes. -

ALFIE
When a certain little something
happens that tells you you've just
witnessed the beginning of the end.
And suddenly you stop and think...
uh—oh, iceberg ahead.

ANGLE - NIKKI

Bent over LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY at the mishap. Other Guests
look on, failing to see the humor. FREEZE on Nikki — out of
control. OVER:

ALFIE VOICE
With Nikki, that was the first of
many Uh—Oh moments...

RAPID FIRE SHOTS — ONE AFTER ANOTHER
LONLIGHTS of life with Nikki...

ALFIE'S VOICE
It began with petty arguments...

—— Nikki, her face filled with rage, throws the contents of
her Martini glass, including the olive, DIRECTLY at CAMERA.

ALFIE'S VOICE (CONT'OI
Followed by random bouts of
melancholia...

—— Nikki sits on a PARK BENCH next to a crazy, filthy BAG
LADY with a garbage-filled shopping cart. They are both
staring blankly into space. The Bag Lady looks way happier
than Nikki.

ALFIE’S VOICE (CONT'D}
Reckless behavior...

-- Alfie's vespa WRAPPED AROUND a fire hydrant, water
spraying into the air... Nikki stands nearby. gesturing -
like it's the hydrant’s fault.

ALFIE’S VOICE {CONT'D}
And thank you, no - I did not have
insurance.
(rolling on)
The girl never knew when she'd had
one too many...

 

SD.

—- Nikki PASSED OUT COLD on the EAR at LUCKY'S. Other
Patrons try not to stare.

ALFIE’S VOICE (CONT'D)
And I begin to dread the way she
made heads turn...
{then}
But, whenever I began to feel there
was little reason to go on...

—— Nikki stretched out on ALEIE'S BED, wearing a clingy
negligee, languidly smoking a cigarette. She gives CAMERA a
“some hither" look.

ALFIE'S VOICE [CONT‘D]
I was reminded that we still had
one very major thing in common...

n- Lu Schnitman, in rollers and a robe has her ear glued to
her APARTMENT WALL.

ALFIE’S VOICE [CONT'D}
Yep, Freud was right — the battier
the bird, the better the boffing.

Lu’s eyes widen as she HEARS Nikki's HYSTERICAL SCREAMS of
PLEASURE coming from Alfie's apartment.

ALEIE'S VOICE ﬁCONT‘D}
(sighs)
If only she didn’t insist on
smoking before, after...

—— Alfie's BED - ENGULFED in FLAMES...

ALFIE'S VOICE {CONT'D}
-- and during...

DISSOLVE INTO:
A PAINT BRUSH

Paints a wide swath of INDIGO ELUE across one of the walls in
ALFIE’S APARTMENT. The room is now cluttered with Nikki’s
things... underwear drying on the back of a chair, make—up,
fashion magazines scattered about, overflowing ashtrays, a
box of Tampons, a bong, a gaggle of prescription pill
bottles...

ANGLE BACK to Nikki, wearing a silk thong and one of Alfie's
big sweaters, painting a wall of Alfie's apartment. Alfie
ENTERS from the bedroom, pulling a scarf around his neck.

 

91.

NIKKI
{over her shoulder}
What time will you be homer honey?

ALFIE
{to CAMERA)
Hear that? What time will I,
honey, be home? Sounds dangerously
close to wife—speak.

NIKKI .
-- ‘Cause I'm making something
really special for din—din.

Alfie LOOKS to CAMERA on ‘din—din'...

ALFIE
I'll ring you. You don't think
that oolor's a bit intense?

Nikki turns to him...

NIKKI
I think you're a hit intense.

She grabs his scarf and pulls him toward her.

ALFIE
Careful — do you have paint on your
hands? Plus, must_you wear one of
my good sweaters to paint in...?

NIKKI
[pulls sweater over her
head}
Sorry,r baby.

She’s now topless. Alfie glances down at his sweater,r as it
FALLS to the floor - with INDIGO PAINT SMUDGES where Nikki
just pulled it off. He sighs...

ALFIE
All right thenJr gotta dash...

She slips her arms around him...

NIKKI _
Bet I can make it worth your while
to stay... 1

ALFIE

Wish I could Nikr but I’ve got that
meeting...

 

92.

As Nikki closes the paint can and moves into the KITCHENr
Alfie TURNS to CAMERA, indicating her toplessness.

ALFIE [CONT‘D]
You know you’re in trouble when a
sight like this can’t keep you
planted.

Nikki begins taking things out of the fridge to prepare
dinner as Alfie starts for the door, TALKING to CAMERA on the
way...

ALFIE {CONT'D)
When I was a boy, St. Alban’s
Secondary, my school, took us all
on a cultural outing to observe art
at some famous museum.in.London.
And while there--

He stops at the threshold, looking back at Nikki.

HIS VIEW

Nikki. tOPlESSly Cutting and dicing phallic vegetables with a
large kitchen knife.

ALFIE {O,S.} [CONT'DI
e— I happened upon this statue of a
Greek Goddess, Afro—diddy, I think
it was, marble, with this
curvaceous womanly shape and
perfect chiseled face. I stood, in
awe of it.

ALFIE turns from Nikki BACK to CAMERA.

ALFIE {CONT'D}

Finally, the teacher called at me
to move along, and, as I walked
past, I realized there were these
huge freakin' cracks all over the
goddess. Ruined her for me.

{a beat}
That’s Nikki,_a beautiful statue,
damaged in a way you can't see ‘til
you get too close.i'

ANGLE - NIKKI

She glances up, smiles at Alfie. She looks a little nuts-
Alfie LOOKS to CAMERA. '

 

93.

ALFIE (CONT'D)
There’s a very unhappy ending
lurking somewhere in our near
future.

Nikki waves, the huge butcher knife in her hand. Alfie
smiles and slips out the door.

EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD — LATE DAY

Alfie pulls up on his Vespa, parks and looks it. He nods to
a Doorman, who bows as he pulls the door wide for Alfie.

ALFIE

INT. POSH APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Alfie nods to the Receptionist. /'

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Gilda.

GILDA
Welcome, Mr. Elkins. Enjoy your

Alfie RAISES an EYEBRON to CANERA as he crosses to the
elevator.

ALFIE
As you can see, the lad's moving——
(presses ‘UP' button}
-- up in the world.

INT. APARTMENT CORRIDOR — CONTINUOUS

Alfie approaches a corner door, inserts a key, then GLANCES
over his shoulder to CAMERA.

ALFIE
You'll never guess who I'm dropping
in on.
INT. APARTMENT — CONTINUOUS
Alfie enters, dropping his keys on the entry table.

THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

 

94.

Italian Moderne with a decided Sixties influence... A fire
crackles in the fireplace, a spread of delicacies awaits on a
well—stocked wet bar. A female ‘pad‘. Seductive and
inviting...

ALFIE
Ito CAMERA)
Nouldnt've believed it meself a few
weeks back.

LIZ GLIDES INTO THE ROOM

stopping under a wind-blown OIL PAINTING of herself in
younger days. She wears a low-cut cocktail dress and heels.

. ALFIE [CONT'DJ
The San Laurent does wonders for
your decolletage.

LIZ
Big word.

ALFIE
Big décolletage.

Liz laughs her throaty laugh.

ALFIE (CONT'D}
Come here immediately.

He kisses her neck, gives her a small smile...

LIZ
What’s up, baby? You're not your
usual effervescent self.

ALFIE
Just some personal stuff. Nothing,
really.

LIZ
Don't ‘nothingJr me.

ALFIE
It’s a... a thing with a friend...
who’s kind of overstayed his
welcome...

LIZ
(knowing)
It’s a lot tougher gettin' ‘em out
than gettin’ ‘em in, isn’t it?

 

95.

ALFIE
So, I'm learning — the hard way._

LIZ
Well, why not just be honest...
{hint or innuendo) }
Tell him the hotel's under new
management and he needs to vacate
the premises. Know what I’m.saying?

Alfie looks at her.

ALFIE
Yes, I believe I do.

LIZ
Now, come on, let’s have a drink
and you can tell me the rest of
your troubles.

ALFIE
{to CAMERAI
——instead of me listening to all
hers. Now there's a first.
{to Liz}
You‘re very wise, for someone so
young.

Liz loves hearing this. Alfie's feeling a bit more chipper,
notices a tasteful floral display.

ALFIE (CONTTDJ
Secret admirer?

LIZ
itsasing}
One of many.
(kisses him}
You'd never think of bringing a
girl flowers, would you, Alfie?

Alfie slides his hands along her body...

ALFIE
It would only encourage them.

LIZ
Mmmm... Down boy.

Liz gives a little growl, running her fingernails across his
chest, as she heads for the bar. Alfie watching with
appreciation, TURNS to CAMERA.

 

 

96.

ALFIE K
Yep, she's someone who could mother
you and rock your world.

LIZ
What’s your poison, sweetheart?

ALFIE
I‘ll have a spot of whiskey,
Midleton Rare, if you've got it?

Alfie crosses to the bar, TALKING to CAMERA.

ALFIE (CONT‘DJ
I like dropping a fancy brand name
now and again, let her know, she
ain't the only one been around...

LIZ
{taking down an exotic

green bottle}
Why don’t we make this an Absinthe
afternoon.

ALFIE
Brilliant.
{to CAMERA}
No idea what she's talking about.

LIZ
You've had Absinthe?

ALFIE
Not recently. Remind me. What is
it again?

LIZ
1'The Green Fairy'. It's an old
European aperitif. The French
Impressionistsr liquid drug of
choice.

Liz takes down two ornate little glasses and mixing utensils.
LIZ (CONT'Dl
I picked up some of those things
you like, the little egg thingys.

Alfie nibbles on an egg thingy from a tray of hors d’oeuvres,

 

9?.

ALFIE

(to CAMERA}
I mention I fancy something once,
next thing I know——

(gestures to hors

d’oeuvres}}
—— it's presented to me on a silver
platter.

Liz begins the Absinthe ritual: Pouring the green liquid into
the small glasses... During this, Alfie wanders around the
Living Room, CAMERA FOLLOWING.

ALFIE {CONT' D}
Groovy, huh? The kind of pad I
plan to own myself one day..
Understated elegance with just a
touch of the trendy.

Ho picks up a fireplace poker, stokes the fire, glances over
at Liz, mixing their drinks, then CONTINUES to CAMERA.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
She’s a regular fashionista... You
never have to tell this one which
sling—backs go with which frock.

He wanders back toward the Bar, still talking TO CAMERA.

ALFIE ECONT‘DJ

Owns her own cosmetics company. 3
Empire, actually. .Started out I
doing facials at some fancy salon, I
mixed up a handful of mud with a
dash of papaya or something, put it
on the market and next thing you
know...

(gestures around}
—— All this.

He returns to the bar, where Liz is dousing a spoonful of
sugar with Absinthe...

LIZ
This stuff is so illegal. Les
smuggled me a case back from Prague
in Listerine bottles.

She tosses Alfie a are FOLDER'from the bar.
LIz {CONT-'D]

Hey, I looked over your business
plan...

 

95.

ALFIE
And?

LIZ
I’m impressed.

ALFIE
You seem surprised.

LIZ
Not at all. Under all that
bravado...

Liz lights the spoon and watches the Absinthe and sugar
FLAME-UP.

LIZ {CONT’D}
-- heats the heart of-a guy who’s a
whole lot smarter than he thinks
but not nearly as cocky as he wants
everyone to believe.

ALFIE
{enjoying this)
And what would we be basing this
on?

LIZ .
That it takes one to know one.

With that, she pours the FLAMING concoction into a glass.
stirs rapidly.

LIZ {CONT'DJ
A dash of sugar to hide the
bitterness...

Liz bends forward, her top revealing the Holland Tunnel, as
she hands the glass to Alfie. He looks down at the S PABLO S
tattooed on her breast, then up to Liz - who's staring
directly in his eyes.

LIZ {CONT'D}
Something on your mind, sailor?

ALFIE
Just wondering if a clever tattoo
artist could turn that Eeblo into
an Alfie...

They exchange a smile, olink glasses.

 

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Cheers.

Alfie chugs it down and immediately lets out a horrific EASE.

ALFIE (CONT'D}
Jesus!
{between gasps}
It's like drinking bleedin’ paint
thinner!

Liz laughs, downs her shot and gasps as well. The stuff is
so strong. Alfie plops into a chair. Liz drifts over, sits
on his knee. A moment, as the Absinthe kicks in...

ALFIE (GONT'DI
{feeling the glow}
Is it meant to make you feel all
warm going down?

LIZ
{kissing him}
No, darling, that’s my job.

The only SOUND in the room - Liz’s NAILS scratching against
the fabric of Alfie’s thigh. They are very close...

LIZ {CONT'D}
You know what they say...
Absinthe makes the heart grow
fonder.

Alfie pats her butt as Liz crosses to the bar and mixes
another round. He rises, really feeling the effect of the
Absinthe, “Whoa”... then motions for CAMERA to FOLLOW.

ALFIE
{sotto, to CAMERA)
Check this out.

He BECKONS us into LIZ'E BATHROOM. Posh. Subducd lighting,
huge jacuzzi tub filled with bubbles and surrounded by
flickering candles.

ALFIE (CDNT'DI
What about the size of this tub?
It can get a bit snug with the both
of us playing around in there...
(then) '
She's had two husbands. Both
crooked.
(indicates tub}
{MORE}

 

lDU.

ALFIE {CONT‘D}
I have a feeling, this could’we
been the scene of the crime.

Liz appears, leaning in the doorway, holding two fresh shots
of Absinthe. She and Alfie share a stoned grin...

ALFIE [CONT'DJ
[sotto, to CAMERA)
I mean there’ve been times I've
felt lucky to crawl out of this
thing alive.

Liz moves to the tub, setting their Absinthe shots on the
ledge, then slipping out of her dress and into the bubbles.

LIZ
Come on, baby, let's get wet.

Alfie TALKS to CAMERA, while unbuttoning his shirt.

ALFIE
She keeps this up, we may be
updating that tattoo sooner than
She thinks...

EXT. ALFIE’S STREET - LATE AT NIGHT

A light rain falls on Alfie standing under a street lamp,
smoking and looking up at his apartment window.

INT. ALFIE'S APARTMENT " MOMENTS LATER

Alfie, damp from the rain, lets himself in, SPEAKING SOFTLY
to CAMERA.

ALFIE
Remember how Little Alfie finally
got what he wanted for Christmas?

Alfie looks around. A TRANSFORMATION has taken place. The
apartment is spotlessly clean and organized. The only chore
left undone is the half-painted Indigo blue wall.

Soft soul music plays on the stereo. Candles, illuminating a
romantic table set for two, have burned low. Nikki dozes on
the sofa. Alfie sighs, TURNS to CAMERA.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
-- Be careful what you wish for.

He crosses to the sofa and gently shakes Nikki. She doesn’t
budge. He shakes her again and she wakes with a start...
Looks at him for a beat, like she doesn't recognize him, then
smiles sleepily.

 

101.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
You dosed off.

NIKKI
I tried waiting up for you...
{site up}
Your meeting ran late, huh, honey?

She stretches, Stunning as always.

She pulls

ALFIE
Quite... and I’m knackered. But, I
did want us to have a little
chat...

NIKKI
{rising}
Okay... Why don't we talk over a
midnight snack?
{crossing to kitchen)
I made roast beef and Yorkshire

Pudding... That was your favorite
as a ‘young lad’, right?
{gestures}

And check the place out, if you
please. Your little girl worked
her fanny off.

ALFIE
Everything looks smashing, Nik.
Really. Brilliant.
{sighs}
Look...

a pan of roasted vegetables out of the oven, sets
counter. starts dishing them into a bowl.

NIKKI
So, Alfie... I*ve been thinking...
will you look at these cute little
potatoes... I know I’ve been a

handful lately... but I think that
has to do a lot with me feeling
displaced and not totally trusting——

DIALS down, as she CONTINUES TALKING, Alfie STEPS

ALFIE
Can you believe she picks tonight
to act_sane again? This is gonna
be tricky...

{MORE}

 

 

102.

ALFIE {oont‘d}
When they’re this vulnerable.
you’ve got to watch your step...
You don't want ‘em swallowing a
handful of pills and leaving a note
addressed to you. Very tricky.

Ho STEPS ASIDE and Nikki's VOICE is DIALED UP again...

NIKKI

__ but I'm as blown away as you are
that something real seems to be
happening between us and--

(stops, to herself}
Okay. Nikr get a grip, don't bury
yourself here.

(to Alfie]
All right. So. Cutting to the
chase... I'm gonna do better, I
promiser I'm gonna take my
medication religiously from now on
and everything's gonna be easy and
breezy. Sound good?

{opening the ovenr J

revealing the roast:
So. Come. SiL. A feast awaits.

ALFIE
l, um... I already ate. Nik.

Nikki covers her disappointment.

NIKKI
Okay. No worries. We'll have
leftovers. I'll whip up a little
corned beef hash for brunch.

She moves to him, puts her hands on his shoulders and smiles.

NIKKI
What's up, Alfie?

ALFIE
Nothing.r it's just... I don't know.
there's a lot going on and I'm
feeling a bite:-
Nikki steps hook realizing something's off. She's suddenly,
wary, a little scared...

NIKKI
What? Cold? Distant? Remote?

 

103.

ALFIE
Look, Nikki, this is a complete
drag... but everything happened so
quickly and... I don’t know... I’m
not the best at this sort of
thing...

NIKKI
{knowing exactly what he
means}
What sort of thing?

ALFIE
-- I don’t know exactly how to say
it. I I

NIKKI
Sure you do, Alfie. You've had
plenty of experience dumping girls.

A look passes between them..2

Nikki crosses the room, pulls her suitcase from the closet.
She sets it on a chair, opens it and looks at Alfie.

NIKKI [CDNT'D]
Don’t worry. I’m already gone.

EXT. STREET — HIGH SHOT — NIGHT

Pouring rain... Nikki, wearing a raincoat but without an
umbrella, holds her suitcases, while trying to hail a cab.

CAMERA EASES BACK to see we are OVER ALFIE’S SHOULDER, as he
looks out his window. Nikki waves down a Taxi and struggles
with her suitcases, finally climbing in and slamming the
door.

As the Taxi disappears in the rain...
ALFIE’ 5 voice
{sounding raspy-now}
Strange, but even when you know it
has to end...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ALFIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING — A FEW WEEKS LATER

Pouring rain. OVER, we HEAR Alfie in a raSpy voice:

 

104.

ALFIE'S sass: vorcr
-- when it finally does, you always
get that inevitable twinge——

INT. ALFIE’S APARTMENT — SAME TIME

Rain streaks the windows. Nikki's gone and the apartment is
once again modest, messy and male. Nikki’s presence echoed
by the half-painted INDIGO BLUE wall.

CAMERA DISCOVERB Alfie, sitting on the edge of the sofa,
shining his shoes with a corner of his comforter, a blanket
draped over his shoulders. He has a cold and looks the worse
for wear. He glances up AT CAMERA.

ALFIE

{raspy}
we have I done the right thing?

He blows his nose into a handkerchief, pulls himself up,
crosses to the KITCHEN AREA where a can of tomato soup is
boiling over the top of a sauce pan.

ALFIE {CONT'DJ
I admit, I do miss the
companionship...

He turns off the burner and pours the soup into a coffee mug,
takes a sip.

ALFIE {CONT'Dj
-— and Nikki was a show-stopper.

He moves to his closet where he removes a sport coat from its
plastic cover and slips it on.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
But, as my ugly Aunt Gladys used to
say, ‘Looks ain't everything'. I
used to think that was a load of
bollix but lately I’ve come to
believe, the old hat may have had
something.

He pulls on his raincoat, gives himself a final mirror—check
and heads for the door. As he's about to exit, he TURNS BACK
to CAMERA.

ALFIE (CONT'DJ
One thing I do know... You can't
really take away a girl's dreams if
you don't have new ones to replace
them with...

 

135.

Somewhere a CHURCH BELL is ringing...
CUT TO:
A CHURCH SPIRE
The BELLS RINGING. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the entrance, as:
THE CHURCH DOORS

arc flung open and JULIE and TERRY bounce out with MAX and
the Teddy Bear Terry gave him for his birthday. They all
hold hands in a row like a family foursome.

Julie grasps a wedding bouquet and looks radiant. All three
are dressed to the nines, laughing and seemingly bursting
with happiness. A small Group of Friends and Family follow,
milling on the church steps, with hugs and kisses while a
PHOTOGRAPHER grabs shots. During:

ALFIE'S VOICE
Jules had left a phone message. It
wasn’t an invitation so much as a
notification...

Alfie watches from the safety of a nearby alcove, TURNS to
CAMERA.

ALFIE
But my curiosity got the best of
me.

Julie takes Terry's lapels and pulls him to her, kissing him.
Everyone cheers.

ALFIE {CONT'Dl
I wish it hadn’t.

The Hell-wishers clap and cheer them on to hold Lhe kiss.

ALFIE {CONT'DJ
You know, it’s funny but Jules used
to say she couldn’t live without
me...

Alfie shrugs... Such is life. He steps from the cover of the
alcove and catches little Max's eye, gives him a wave.

Max just stands there, hugging his Teddy... either no longer
remembering Alfie or no longer trusting him...

 

106.

Alfie slips back out of sight as the Newlyweds break and
Terry picks Max up. Max throws his arms around Terry's neck,
the way he used to do with Alfie.

Alfie watches “The New Family” posing for pictures in front
of the church...

ALFIE'S VOICE
I had the sudden realization that
I'd probably never see Jules and
Max again...

Alfie, hidden in the shadows of the alcove, LOOKS to CAMERA.

ALFIE
This was followed by a very
unpleasant feeling in the vicinity
of my heart...

He glances back for one final look, then walks away...
EXTJINT. LIED DEPOT - OUTSIDE WING'S OFFICE — LATER THAT DAT

Alfie enters. He HEARS an odd sound... is it WHIMRERING?
Has Mrs. Wing finally been pushed over the edge? Alfie
hesitates outside HIHG'S OFFICE, then knocks lightly, peeks
inside.

ALFIE
Hello? Hrs. Wing, is everything——
Oh...

Alfie stops when he SEES:
WING — BENT OVER HES DESK

his body racked with heart—wrenching SOBS. Alfie can't quite
put it together.

ALFIE [CONT'Dl
Wing? Are you... crying?

Wing grabs tissues, blows his nose loudly and wipes his
swollen, red—rimmed eyes.

WING
I not cryl Get out!

ALFIE
Are you sure yDU’re--

WING
—— I fine! Get out, Alfie!

 

Alfie backs out, closing the door, just leaving his

Alfie pushes the door back open.

ALFIE

A pause.
ALFIE
Whaddya mean?
WING

ALFIE

Alfie LOOKS to CAMERA, unbelieving, then:

ALFIE
Look, mate, I'm sure you can get
her back. I mean, a woman of her
age, how many options--

The stern look on Wing's face stops Alfie. He changes tact.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
Woo her, send flowers, write a
poem.

WING
(tentatively)
That what you would do?

ALFIE
Absolutely.

 

103.

Wing considers this for a moment, then picks up pad and pen.

WING
What rhyme with Blossom?
ALFIE
{thinks about it)
I'd go with... Awesome?
WING
Okay.
(tossing Alfie a set of
KEYS)
Get lost.

Wing begins composing. Alfie slips out while he can.
EXT. UPSTATE NEW IORK - HIGH SHOT - DAY

The Black Town Car looks out of place rolling through a quiet
green upstate New York suburb.

A COUNTRY ROAD — DAY
The Town Car drives down a bumpy, unpaved road.
EXT. BUNGALDW — DAY

The Town Car pulls into a gravel drive and parks in front of
a modest, well—kept bungalow with a flourishing garden.

Alfie climbs out, stretches. A DOG barks. He reaches into the
Town Car and pulls out the Red Folder with his business plan.

woMAN {0.5.}
You never cease to amaze.

Alfie turns as the SCREEN DOOR OPENS and LDNETTE steps onto
the porch. She doesn't seem pleased to see him.

ALFIE
Really great to see you, too, Lon.
[no reaction)
Guess I should have rang.

LDNETTE

Really... this was not smart.
ALFIE

What's not smart? What are we
talking about?

The BABY CRIES again.

ALFIE (CONTTDJ
Wait a minute, You guys... didn’t
have a baby...?

Lonette says nothing.

ALFIE {CONT'D)
You did have a baby.

LONETTE
No, you were right the first
time...

Alfie looks at Lonette, trying to piece together what she's
saying. He reaches for the door handle. They look eyes for
a moment .

 

110.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Alfie moves along the unfamiliar hall, following the SOUNDS
of the BABY.

TNT . NURSERY

most or ALFIE. He steps into the nursery and slowly crosses
to the crib... confused by what he sees.

ALFIE'E VIEW

A gorgeous BI-RACIAL BABY staring up at him. Alfie moves a
little blanket aside for a better view of the Baby’s face.

LONETTE steps into the NURSERY behind him. Alfie turns to
her, starts to speak but somehow words won't form.

LONETTE
{soft 13;)
yeah... he’s your son... You can
close your mouth now...

He looks down at the Baby, then back to Lonette, who has
tears in her eyes.

FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC - DAY

That drizzly day many months ago... Alfie glances up as the
CLINIC DOOR OPENS and Lonette walks toward him. Alfie
hurries to meet her. '

ALFIE’S NOICE
And then I flashed on that day at
the clinic...

Alfie looks in her eyes.

ALFIE'S VOICE (CONT'D}
—— trying to look in Lon's eyes...
to see if I could even begin to
understand what she was going
through...

But Lonette turns away. avoiding his gaze.

ALFIE’S VOICE {CONT'Dl
And how she wouldn't look at me.

FREEZE FRAME on Lonette. OVER:

 

 

lll.

ALFIE'S VOICE ECONT'D}
And how I think I knew then... I
just didn’t want to admit it to
myself. So, classically — I said
nothing.

LONETTE (0.5.)
I knew there was a good chance the
baby could be Marlon's...

lNT. NURSERY - THE PRESENT

A dazed Alfie, holds on to the crib for support. Lonette is
Crying softly now, she shrugs...

LONETTE {CONT'D}
n— I hoped...

Alfie is pretty much shattered...

ALFIE
This is just a lot...
{at a loss]
He’s healthy and everything...?
(she nods]
That’s good.

A heat.

ALFIE {CONTTD}
And Marlon? He stayed?

LONETTE
{shrugs}
So far...

ALFIE
(nods, a best}
Is there... What can I do...?

LONETTE
{get real)
What are you gonna do, Alfie?

She looks at him, honestly waiting for an answer.
EXT. BUNGALOW ~ MOMENTS LATER
Still reelingJr Alfie steps into the sunlight, holding the Red

Folder. He moves quickly to the Town Car, opens the door,
then HEARS the sound of tires_on gravel.

 

112.

He turns to see a car pull up and park. A heat and Marlon
gets out, holding a bag of groceries. He looks across the
drive at Alfie. The two old friends stare at each other for
a long moment.

_ sLFIE
MEIlOI'l. . . I never meant t0. . .

MARLON
{ahead of Alfie)
You never mean to hurt anybody.

Alfie starts to speak...

MARLON (CONT'D)
—— But you do, Alfie.

Lonette steps onto the porch, holding the Baby. Alfie looks
from Lonette back to Marlon.

INT. TOWN CAR - SPEEDING — DAY

CLOSE ON Alfie, intense, driving way too fast. He comes to a
fork in the road, hits his brakes, whips the wheel one way,
then the other, finally screeching to a stop, kicking up huge
clouds of dust. f

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

Alfie sits there motionless... He picks up the car phone...
and SMASHES it against the windshield — SEATTERING the glass
like a spider web. He drops his head on the steering wheel-

EXT. COUNTRY ROhD - TOP SHOT - DAY

Dust settling around the Town Car idling in the middle of
nowhere.

sissoLvE TO:
EXT. EMPTY BEACH - LONG SHOT — AT SUNSET

ALFIE'S VOICE
I felt the need of a friend to talk
to. Problem was a they were
suddenly in short supply.

TWO DISTANT FIGURES walk along the shore. OVER:

 

 

113.

ALFIE
—— And next thing, I'm crying...
Tears running down my face, like I
was a kid myself.

.CLOSER ANGLE

Alfie is walking with JOE, the old guy from the Doctor’s
Joe wears a sweater and another bolo tie. His slacks
are rolled to his knees, and he carries his shoes and socks.

office.

A best,

BE

JOE
Crying for the little one...?

ALFIE

That's the thing... I don't know
exactly. Maybe for him... But
mostly, I think, for me.

{pause}
And Marlon... I never had anybody
look at me quite that way before.
And believe me, I've had my share
of looks that could kill.

{then}
And the way he stood by Lon... I
could've never——

JOE
+— You don't know what you'll do
‘til you really love someone...

this sinks in...

JOE (CONT'D}
But now, what? You gonna shoehorn
yourself into the situation? Nah,
you did the only thing you could do
- you behaved like a gentleman.

ALFIE _
I‘ve never been accused of that
before.

JOE

Don’t get all choked up, yen also

behaved like a scheming. back-

stabbing, so low he can look up a

snake’s asshole, son-of—a—bitch.
{then}

Next time, think before unzipping.

I mean, your best friend's girl...

They continue along the shoreline until finally...

 

_ ALFIE
All for a couple of minutes
pleasure on a rainy Sunday evening.

JOE _
So all right, you screwed up but
whaddya gonna do F run to the
bridge?
(than)
The question is - what's gonna
happen with the rest of your life?

They walk on. Not much else to say.

Alfie stops when he spots something up ahead. He smiles and
waves.

ALFIE'S VIEW - LU SCHNITMAN

Dolled—up and STANDING on a seam CLIFF above the water. She
waves down to:

ALFIE AND JOE
Alfie puts his arm around Joe.

ALFIE
Hey Joe, there’s somebody I want
you to meet.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS — THAT EVENING

A blustery night. Alfie buzzes through traffic on his now
banged—up Vespa. He looks cold and distracted and a bit
bedraggled. He passes a pair of true HOTTIES on the street,
doesn’t look twice.

ALFIE'S VOICE
I'd be lying if I didn’t admit the
events of the past few weeks have
knocked me for a bit of a loop....

Alfie notices something out of the corner of his eye, a
QUAINT FLOWER SHOP. He impulsively hangs a “u” causing horns
to blow and Cabbies to curse.

INT. QUAINT FLOWER SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
A gray-haired, snappily—dressed PROPRIETOR, is arranging an

chic bouquet when Alfie enters, rubbing his hands together
for warmth.

 

115.

ALFIE
Hullo, mate.
PROPRIETOR
And what can we do for you this

evening?

Alfie looks around. sees a plastic tub of ore-packaged
bouquets.

ALFIE
How much for one of those?

PROPRIETOR
Five-fifty; And you'll need to pu:
them in water immediately.

ALFIE
Right...

Alfie picks a bouquet from the tub and pulls out his wallet.
He eyes the elegant bouquet being prepared at the counter.
Looks at his inferior offering...

ALFIE [CONT‘D}
On second thought...
{drops flowers back in
tub}
-— this is sort of a... special
thing.

PROPRIETOR
And what‘s the occasion?

ALFIE
Say again?

PROPRIETOR
For the flowers?

ALFIE
Ah....

Alfie isn't really sure, has to think about it.

PROPRIETOR
I've been in the business too many
years, I have a sixth sense:
Proposal?

 

116.

ALFIE
No... but... Well, I do want to
extend an offer to maybe try to
have a go at it for a bit, you
know...? See where it takes us...
Give it a spin... That sort of
thing...

PROPRIETOR
(knowing smile}
I get it. Commitment issues.

Alfie nods, unamused.

PROPRIETOR {CONT'DJ
Tell me what she or he is like and
we’ll find the appropriate blooms.

ALFIE
Well she’s... adventurous.
The Man picks a flower... begins putting together a bouquet.
PROPRIETOR
Lady of the Nile.
ALFIE
Sexy, of course...
PROPRIETOR
Orchid.
ALFIE
A bit mischievous...
PROPRIETOR
Spider Lily with a touch of Baby
Blue Eyes...
ALFIE

And under it all, kind of sweet...

EXT. FLOWER SHOP - EVENING

THROUGH THE WINDOW, we watch Alfie and the Proprietor putting
together Alfie’s bouquet with great care.

EXT. LIZ'S BUILDING — A LITTLE LATER

Alfie holding hiS‘lovely bouquet, pulls up and parks his
weeps.

 

11?.

INT. CORRIDOR

Alfie walks down the corridor, holding the bouquet. He slows
to do a moving mirror—Check, then stops in front of Liz's
door, a bit like a kid on his first date...

INT. LIZ'S APARTMENT.- FOYER — CONTINUOUS

Alfie lets himself in, KNOCKING on the door as he enters.
Liz’s VOICE comea from the bathroom.

LIZ {O.$.]
Hello?

Alfie moves into the hall.

_ ALFIE
It's me, luv]

LIZ {D.S.l
Just a sec. I’ll be right out.

Alfie grins, sets the flowers down, as Liz comes out of the
BATHROOM, tying her robe.

LIZ [CONT‘D}
{rubbing her temple)
I'm sorry, Alfie, I'm taking a hot
soak. I have got one of the worst
migraines ever.

ALFIE
Migraine...?

LIZ
I've told you I get these blinding
headaches... You don't listen,
sweetie.
{then}
How are you? I thought you were
working tonight...

He moves to the LIVING ROOM. She follows.

ALFIE _
It was a bit slow, so I took the
night Off.... I thought maybe we'd
wake up early and drive to the
country... Check out that little
B a E you're always on about.

 

113.

LIZ
—— Oh, honey... I'd love to, but
I've got an investors’ breakfast...
Can we do it later in the week? Or
how ‘bout this weekend?

ALFIE
Brilliant. Better.
{trying for casual}
All right, then... By the way, I
thought you might appreciate these.

He picks up the FLOWERS, does a cute little bow.

ALFIE (COWT'D)
For you... M'lady.

It's an impressive bouquet. Liz is surprised, touched.

A heat.

LIZ
Oh, my God, Alfie 4_what a sweet
gesture. Wow. I’m'impressed.

ALFIE
And by the way, they’re not from a
plastic bucket... Every bud is

handpicked. I discovered I have
quite the flair for flower—
arranging.

LIZ
{laughs}
I can SEE that. I never would’ve
expected... Talk about being blown
away...

ALFIE
Good. Mission accomplished.

ALFIE [CONT‘DJ
I like surprising you.

LIZ
{smiles} '
YOU'VE done that. For sure.

She smells the flowers. This is difficult for Alfie- He
takes a step forward, she touches her head, winoes slightly,
he eases back.

 

119.

ALFIE
All right, then... Get some rest.

He moves to the door. Liz follows.

LIZ
I'll be better in the morning.

ALFIE
When you are, there’s something -
some things — I want us to talk
about.

LIZ
What things, honey?

ALFIE

Um... you know what... I'd rather
save it ‘til you're a hundred
percent.

(she starts to speak)
And that’s the last I'll say about
it for now.

(gives her a peck on the

lips]
Ring you in the morning.

LIZ
(leading him to the door)
Alfie...
He turns back. She touchea his arm.
LIZ {CONT'DJ
Thanks for the flowers. Really.
They made my night.

Alfie smiles, opens the door.

ALFIE
I’ll ring you first thing....

As he's about to step out, Alfie catches sight of something
in the foyer.

HIS VIEW n A NOTOR~CYCLE JACKET
casually hanging on a hook.
BACK TO ALFIE

Liz has followed his look. She glances at the jacket, then
Lo Alfie.

 

120.

ALFIE [CONT’D]
Whose is that?

Alfie crosses back, picks up the jacket.

LIZ
What... ?

He looks at the jacket, then up at Liz.

LIZ {COWT'DJ
One of the guys that came to fix
the cable probably forgot--

ALFIE
—- Right.

Alfie shakes his head, reality starting to sink in...
ALFIE (CONT'D)
{gestures to bathroom]
You’ve got another guy in thEIE.

haven’t you?

LIZ
Alfie....

Alfie looks heavenward.

ALFIE
God, what's happened to me?
(then)
Did he pick you up as easy as I

did?
Alfie moves past her and opens the bathroom door.

LIZ ,
Alfie, do not do this.

INT. LIZ’S BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS

Alfie stands in the doorway, a look of blank amazement on his
face.

HIS VIEW - A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GUY

is stepping out of the tub, wrapping a towel around his
waist. He’s twenty—something with tousled long hair. He
glances casually up at Alfie.

Alfie stares at the Young Man. 'Liz has moved in behind him,
puts her hands to her face.

 

121.

LIZ
Alfie... I’m sorry.
Alfie moves away from the door... leans against the wall, his
eyes closed.... He speaks with a mixture of bewilderment and
pain...
ALFIE
Why him — better than me? What's
he got that I haven’t? Besides the
hairdo?

Liz looks away... Alfie looks directly at her new.

ALFIE {COHT'D)
Really, I’d like to know.

She doesn’t want to answer.

ALFIE [CONT'D)
Come on — tell me. I want to know.
What’s he got?

A heat. She turns to him and says honestly...

LIZ
He's younger than you.

CAMERA HOLDS on Alfie as these words sink in...
DISEOLVE To;

DARK CHOPPY WATERS

Liz’s FLOWERS fall through the darkness.

EXT. WATERWAY’S FERRY — LATER THAT EVENING

Alfie, still dazed, leans over the railing, watehino the
flowers break apart in the water.

ALFIE’S VOICE
‘He’s younger than you.’ Imagine, a
woman her age telling me that.
{pause}
I gotta admit I didn’t see it
coming. Yeah, she caught me off-
guard all right...

he turns up his collar against the chill, LOOKS to CAMERA.

 

122.

ALFIE
You couldn't tell though, could
you?
[slight grin}
As you've learned by now, I'm quite
skilled at hiding my feelings.

CAMERA TRACKS Alfie walking along the river. He passes a
YOUNG COUPLE leaning against the rail, laughing and then
seriously making—out.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
{to CAMERA}
The thing about feelings is, they
have this quiet way of creeping up
on you when you least expect it.

CAMERA DRIFTS CLOSER to Alfie, as he wanders along the
bridge.

ALFIE {CDNTTD}
Like with Liz. Who would’ve
thought, out of all the birds I've

known... it would he her, the one
who, in most ways, gave me the
least... would end up hurting me

the most...?

He forces a smile... starts to speak T0 CAMERA again when he
notices someone coming toward him through the fog.

ALFIE'S VIEW

DORIE, the Woman from the beginning of our story, walking
toward him. She doesn't seem to notice Alfie, or did she
quickly look away?

ALFIE fCONT'Dl
Hey...
(squinting through fog}
That you. Der?

Dorie walks hesitantly toward him.

DORIE
Hello, Alfie.
ALFIE
(happy to see her)
Wow. Dorie — I haven't seen you in

ages.

 

123.

. DORIE
Maybe because you stopped calling.

ALFIE
I know. Things were getting a bit——

DORIE
—— Don't bother explaining. I’m way
past needing excuses.

ALFIE
All right.
{a beat}
..but... no, Dor, I want to
explain...

DDRIE
What? You'd had your fill of me?
Someone outer came along? I don't
need to hear it, Alfie, really.

ALFIE
Look, Dorie, you see, what happens
with me is... I... well. it gets
too... I don’t know... not close,

but something like that. And then,
I feel a bit... not stifled, not
trapped but... something like
that...

Dorie almost laughs, shakes her head... there's something
irresistible about even his confession.

A beat.

DORIE
Are you done?

ALFIE _
Well, did any of that make sense?

DORIE
I think it needs to make sense to
you more than me at this point.

ALFIE
Fair enough.
{then}
Hey, I like that dress. $ilk?

DORIE
Rayon.

 

 

124.

ALFIE
Oh. Well, you look smashing, as
usual.
(then)
Where you headed? I’ve got the
town car parked ‘round the corner.

DORIE
I’m meeting Phil.

ALFIE

Oh, right... Phil.

[touching her dress}
I really do like this material.
You’d swear it was silk the way it
clings. Does wonders for your
decolletage.

{that grin}
Of course. you always were a smart
dresser. What about Tuesday then?
You up for it? '

A FOG HORN blares.

DORIE
I don’t think so, Alfie.
ALFIE
Really? Oh, c’mon, for old times

sake.

He takes her hand in both of his and massages it with great
skill, his fingers running up her arm.

DORIE
I'm.not sure... Maybe. But I doubt
it.
ALFIE
I’ll supply the champagne.
DORIS
We’ll see. I need to go. He’ll be

waiting.

She starts to pass, Alfie gently holds her arm.

ALFIE
So, next Tuesday? Same time? Same
place?

DORIE

Maybe, Alfie.

 

125.

She forces a smile and hurries off. After a moment, Alfie
TURNS to CAMERA with a half a smile.

ALFIE
She won’t be there. I know that.

The smile fades as Alfie watches another woman walk out of
his life.

OVER DORIE
Disappearing into the mist.

ALFIE {0.5.} {CONT'DJ
I warned them all from the start...
I always said something along the
lines of - ‘I must advise you that
I am stamped with an invisible
advisory warning: will not commit,
will never marry.’

He turns BACK to CAMERA.

ALFIE {CONT'D}
But in spite of all my best
efforts, I’m beginning to feel scam
small cracks in my faux finish...

ALFIE’S FLEETING MEMORIES

-- NIKKI waking Alfie with a breakfast tray. He’s rumpled
and sleepy, she is stunningly beautiful and looks at him with
hope in her eyes. And the tray is the one you make for
someone you really care for... The single rose in a bud vase,
perfect eggs, steaming cappuccino.

-- LIZ and Alfie, wearing terry robes, facing each other on
her sofa, in front of a crackling fire, giving each other
pedicures. She’s a pro, he’s like a little kid with his first
paint set...

—— Alfie, laughing along with his friend LONETTE that night
at the bar... before everything changed.

—— JULIE and MAX, their faces glowing from the candles on a
birthday cake they are presenting to Alfie. They sing “Happy
Birthday, Dear Alfie”... It’s the moment they loved him most.

BACK TO ALFIE - ALONE ON THE BRIDGE

 

126.

ALFIE {CONT'D}

You know, when I look back on my
little life and the women I've
known - I think of all they’ve done
for me and how little I’ve done for
them. Of now they cared for me and
how I repaid them by doing my has:
to avoid returning the favor.

[a heat}
Yeah, I used to think I was getting
the best of the deal.

He wanders along the river's edge, CAMERA TRACKS along.

ALFIE {COWT'D}
But what have I got really?
A few bucks in my pocket, some
decent threads, a fancy car at my
disposal. And I’m single. Yeah...
Unattached. Free as a bird.

HIGH SHOT — THE SMALL FIGURE OF ALFIE

He walks along the embankment, he appears tiny against the
vast expanse of river.

ALFIE'S VOICE
I don't depend on nobody w and
nobody depends on me.
{pause} '
Hy life’s my own.

NOW ALFIE WALKS TOWARD CAMERA

He stops, stares out at the darkness for a time, then LOOKS
DIRECTLY at CAMERA.

ALFIE

But I don’t have my peace of mind.
And if you don’t have that...
you‘ve got nothing really.

(pause)
So, what’s the answer? That’s what
I keep asking myself.

(a beat}
What's it all about? You know what
I mean? '

Alfie turns and looks off. A little MUTT, trots toward him.
Alfie smiles, bends to pet him, the Dog licks Alfie’s face.

 

12?.

WOMAN’S VOICE
Ohmygod, thanks... He’s always
running away.

Alfie looks up and sees a lovely, BREATHLESS YOUNG WOMAN
holding a leash and smiling down at him. Maybe it's her
slightly embarrassed manner, or the way her nose orinkles '
when she smiles, or maybe it’s the way the scarf is tied '
European-style around her neck... Or maybe it's just time... ;

Alfie rises, holding the dog.

ALFIE
What’s...
(checks quickly and
discreetly)
-- his name?

YOUNG WOMAN
Mugsy.

ALFIE
.(looks at dog]
Hello, Mugsy.
[looks at the Girl}
I'm Alfie.

THE RIVER’S EDGE — HIGH SHOT
Alfie and the Breathless Girl talk for a few moments, then

Alfie sets the little Mutt down and they all walk along the
river’s edge together...

And the song begins...

What’s it all about, Alfie?
Is it just re: the moment we live?

What's it all about, when you sort
it out, Alfie?

Are we meant to take more than we
give?

Or are we meant to lave...

 

Alfie. . . ?

FADE OUT .

128.
