I stood upon a high place

And said, “Comrade! Brother!”

clogged with police cars and curiosity

FADE IN:
ECU of PAPER; you can see the pulp texture.

Pause... Another shape appears, bright RED and huge.
A THUMBNAIL. CAMERA begins, slowly, to pull back...

A PEN POINT. .It begins WRITING gracefully:

NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT I’M
GOING TO DO TONIGHT. THAT'S OKAY.

Pulling back. Feminine HANDS now, in View.

MY DECISION, HOWEVER, IS A RATIONAL,
COGNATIVE ONE. I CAN NO LONGER

Stops. Finger taps the page thoughtfully. Reaches off ——
re-enters with a DICTIONARY. Flips through it. .

COG—NI—TIVE, adj.

She scratches out the word COGNATIVE. COGNITIVE in its
place. Sets aside the dictionary. Continues:

1 CAN NO LONGER PERSERVERE. IT MAX
COMFORT MY FATHER TO KNOW THAT MY SUICIDE

Grabs the dictionary. Flips through... PERSEVERE, v.
'PERSERVERE wrong; PERSEVERE, that's got it...

TO KNOW THAT MY SUICIDE IS DUE
VONLY PARTIALLY TO HIM. '

A pause, then, as an afterthought:
YOU THINK I'M STUPID,_DADDY BUT I'M NOT

DAY ONE l TROUBLE IS MY BUSINESS
' EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS — NIGHT .

The CAMERA roams the canyons west. Starts high in the
night air. DIPS toward the road, free-falling...

Whooooosh..! Falls into line, alongside fast—moving
CARS, all rushing uphill... To an opulent HOUSE.

LIMOS rolling in, as we HEAR:

 

NARRATOR (v.0. )
It' s hard to believe it was just last . _
Christmas that me and Harmony changed the
world. We didn't mean to; and it didn't
last long —— a thing like that can't.
(beat)
Thanks for coming. I guess you 'd call
this a detective story; there are dull
parts, but there's a murder in it. Also
a broken heart so I guess it's a love
story. Oh, and everything's connected,
it all loops back around, it's cool. My
name's Harry Lockhart, I’ll be your
narrator. Welcome to L.A. _Welcome-to
the party. -'

INT. HOUSE — LAVISH ENTRYWAY — NIGHT

Camera descends, huge GALA in'progress., Wall to wall
money. Two JUNIOR AGENTS go by, deep in debate:

ICM TYPE
Okay, you can oWn a_y gm you want STAR
WARS? You can have it —— exact mOvie, _
everything's 100% the same —— except in

the middle, Yoda points and says, "Luke,

- you dumbfuck! Quit dickin' around and
pay attention.“ Then it goes back to
normal. Rest of the movie, exactly the
sam'. Would yOu invest..?

AN ALMOST HANDSOME MAN enters, dressed a tad shabby,
sports the only tie he owns; welcome HARRY, our narrator.

HARRY (v. o. )

'That' s me: Harry. Now that I'm in L. A._,
I go to parties -— the kind. where ii a
girl is named Jill she spells it J—Y—L—L—
E, that bullshit. ‘ -

Before he's_ten feet in, a tricked—Out BLONDE approaches!

BLQNDE
Hi. What do you do for a living?

No preamble; just like that. Harry smiles:
. ' HARRY
I invented dice.

- BLONDE
Oh.

 

HARRY
And you..?'

The blonde shrugs. Says offshandedly:

- BLONDE
I_do a little acting.

FLASH: THE BLONDE, NAKED atop Andrew Stevens. She looks
up, SHRIEK ——l A CREATURE swipes a CLAW at her. A bad
replica of her HEAD blasts through a glass WINDOW.

BACK TO SCENE: The blonde smiles. Pause, then:

BLONDE
I'm gonna see who else is here.'

She walks away. :He watches her go. Shifts his gaze -—

LOCATES-TWO MEN in the crowd. One's portly. Sucks on'a
cigarette, then glares at_it like it just made him angry.
_The other is trim, wide—shouldered. -

HARRY _(V.O.)
Guy smoking, that's Dabney Shaw, my
producer; he "discovered" me. The man
walking with him is Perry van Shrike,-AKA
Gay Perry; honest—to—God priVate eye,
consults in-film, TV.. Just incorporated,
he's big time.‘ Also he's gay. '

.Producer Shaw and Gay Perry wander near another, OBVIOUS
GAY'MAN (Perry is not obvious, F.Y.I.) and overhear:

OBVIOUSLY GAY MAN
... I said I wished I was Queen
Elizabeth, and he goes, “Oh, baby, you
sure you want to be a virgin Queen..?"

SHAW
(shakes his head)
All these gay stories. Christ.

GAY PERRY _
Scares you, that sort of talk...?

' SHAW
Don't start, Perry. Look, I seen you
play ball, I know you're tough, it's
just... you see a guy‘s wally, your brain
.goes to, "I wanna grab that," for me,
see, that's... that's a real leap.
_ (MORE)

 

SHAW (cont' d)
It' s like, "Hey, an elephant —— Quick,
. let's use its blood to paint my -
boathouse." Not the first -thing you
think of.

BACK WITH HARRY: He discovers a VAST ROOM -— 300 peOple.

HARRY (v.o.)

L.A. —~ By now, you may wonder how I
wound up here... or maybe not, maybe you
wonder how Silly Putty picks shit up from
comic. books, point is, I don't see
‘another Goddamn narrator, so pipe down.
How'd I get here? See for yourself.

CUT TO BLACK. Pause... then, over black we SUPER:

EXT. TOY STORE 4 NIGHT

A BURGLAR ALARM, ringing., Continuous. HARRY and RICHIE
_come bolting out of the store. Feet pounding.

SIRENS, now, as prowl cars respond to the call.

. BAUER
Shit! Shit!

The men pitch forward into a big HEDGE. Crash through.
Into a courtyard, into someone' s PARTY. BAUER pulls out
- A HANDGUN. Waves it like a wand. People evaporate.

' HARRY
PUT THAT THING AWAY.

BAUER
It' s not loaded, we should load it——

- HARRY
We're not shooting anyone. .Go right.

INT. IDARKENED LAUNDRY ROOM - SAME

Harry kicks the door, SPLINTERS it. They race inside.
Pull up short, sucking air. Harry shuts the door.

Richie, NO! _
Bang——! Her gunshot passes THROUGH HARRY‘S.ARM.
Kills his friend. BAUER collapses.

Echo, dying_away. Harry, in shock. Looks at his pierced

AcOmes out, an explosion of glass. Hits, rolls —— Comes
.up running as the NEXT SHOT blows splinters from a-tree.

A POLICE_CAR

Comes squawling around the corner. .Fuck. Harry flings

himself down an alley. The night, ALIVE with sirens..

‘He runs, breath sawing in and out. Rips off his jacket.

Doesn't break stride, wraps his bleeding arm.

UP AHEAD: People, milling ontside a doorway. Sipping ,
coffee.' AA meeting on break? He slows to a briSk walk.

BEHIND HIM, a prowl car roUnds the corner.

 

 

 

He's got 10 seconds._ Nods to the group ahead. Hi, how
are you, I'm so fucking nonchalant, makes a production of
YAWNING, ho—hum, hope they catch that fugitive ——

Ducks into the building, fast. Jacket, masking his
_wound. A POLICE SPOTLIGHT stabs into the foyer, shit..1
Harry picks a door, any door. Goes through it, FAST ——

'INT. ROOM
A tidy office. THREE PEOPLE look up, surprised ——-

' At Harry, sweating. Going into shock. His face twitches
and there‘s blood where Bauer SPRAYED him.

AN ELDERLY WOMAN
(frowns disapproval)
Sir, thatls the wrong door. Please go
back out and wait with the others --

One portly man is studying Harry... abruptly interrupts:
' ' MAN ' . I
Grace, I'd say this guy's ready to go.
Doesn't he look ready to go? .
We recognize DABNEY SHAW, the producer.from before. He-
smiles encouragingly.' Harry, bewildered —— What's going
'_on, don't.they notice he can barely stand up..?
EXT. BUILDING é SAME TIME
-The POLICE CRUISER stops; a COP gets out, scans faces as
INT. OFFICE — BACK WITH HARRY

The seated trio watches, expectantly 4— Harry's got paper
in his hand. Gunshot wound, hidden. .Blinks. Swallows.

Incredibly, begins to do an ACTING SCENE with the woman.

_ ELDERLY WOMAN_
Where is he, where's Rafael?

-Harry, shaking. Breathing hard. Reads:
_ HARRY _
Um... beat on me all night. You want me
to give Up my client, you can go spit.

Harry is swaying. ,Close to blacking out. Jaw clenched.
We hear the COP, now.' Outside the do r. '

 

 

ELDERLY WOMAN ..
-Quit acting like the goodguy, jerkoff.
You got your partner killed.

Harry looks up, startled. Recovers, looks down —-
-It' s there. In the Goddamn script. He swallows hard.

- ELDERLY WOMAN
He was in over his head, you knew it.
You pulled that_trigger. YOU killed him.

Harry leaps, SLAMS his fist On the desk. 'The casting
people jump —— He's delirious. Reality and fiction BLUR.

HARRY -
I didn't kill him, he‘... he wanted- in...

At which point, Harry begins to cry. .Wracking sobs.

HARRY
Why... Why' d he... have to come in on it,
told him to stay home... Stupid son of a
bitch... Shoulda been me, I killed him..!
(breaks down, hugging himself)
.. .I' m sorry. . I'm sorry...

Silence.. Casting people, staring. Harry sobbing. THE
COP throws open the door, hand on his holster ——

. COP
Oh, wow, sorry. _
(to Harry, lamely)

Good luck.

He leaves. The casting people look at Harry. At each
other. SHAW has a gleam in his Ieye. Whispers: '

SHAW
This tape goes in the L. A pouch. And get
me Gay Perry on the line, will you..?

He draws deep On his cigar... CUT BACK TO PRESENT DAY:
INT. OPULENT HOUSE — LOS ANGELES - PARTY STILL RAGING

HARRY, looking thoroughly out of place. Reaching for a
fork, his tie in the tomato sauce, we HEAR: - _

Lane; IQ: 166. Job: Actress. Go.figure.

New character —— our focus shifts to A WOMAN at the
fireplace. Alternately eating pizza, sipping coffee.

A predatory ICM TYPE listens, impatien-t, as she RANTS
vwith a- surprising fierceness:

Other reindeer laugh at him. They soorn
him -- then, out of the blue, they NEED
him for something, he' s good as a
fucking... foglight, or whatever, so tell
me, how's that any different from, 'Don't
talk to Reggie, he's black. Oh, wait, he
can play basketball? Sign him up!‘

' (Yawns)
Sorry. Worked a double Shift, then
catered. Go ahead, ask me why I'm here.

She gets up to fetch some, he never gets in a word.

HARRY (v0)
Most people would say Harmony got to the
party because of the stuff with the
robot. I'll get.to that —— but for me?
The robot, uh-uh —- I'd go back a bit
farther. Like I said, destiny. "

EXT. BACKYARD CARNIVAL, CIRCA 1978 - DAYTIME

HARMONY, AGE 7: We're on her face. In the b. g., a sign:

.HARMONY ‘
"'Go'to hell, Jonny Gossamer,’ she told
me. She'd poured herself into a seamless
dress. From the look of it she'd spilled
some. 'Lady,’ I said, 'Where_I live,
it's not much of a commute...'“'

 

 

 

HARRY (v.o.) _
Jonny offered salvation; he spoke from
the pages of cheap paperbacks, and told
of a-promised land... called Los Angeles.

Not long after that, Harmony skipped.

"On the bus to L. A., she had a nightmare;

“ficus. Detective lessons, tomorrow.
Don‘ t forget.

(starts to pull away, stops)
Oh, and Harry, your girl..?- I know her,-
she did some work for me. You might try
the Domino Room.

With that, he roars off down the sloping drive -— CUT TO:
FINGERS-ON A KEYBOARD. An upbeat riff ushers as into:
INT. THE DOMINO ROOM — NIGHT.

HARRY enters the bar. Orients himself. Eyes, roving...
An ABUNDANTLY—BREASTED GIRL comes up to him:

' ' ‘GIRL
Hey, there. I'm Flicka.
HARRY
Hey.

'What do you do?
Again the question. Harry blinks.

HARRY

Nice to meet you. 'Bye.

Wanders off. _Easy come, easy go. _He scans the-crow ——

THERE. 'Harmony. At the bar. No sign of the asshole
from before.- Instead, a semi—attractive female FRIEND.

As he watches, the FRIEND heads for the bathroom.
Harmony alone, bingo —— he ambles up, trying for slick:

HARRY
'Evening. I'm Harry.

He winces,_makes a show of rubbing his shoulder.

I mean physically, not, you know, like a

I' m visiting frOm New York. Um, I think
I saw you at a party, couple hours ago..?

She doeSn't-look up. Sips her drink, says:

HARMONY

HARRY
Why what?
' HARMONY

Why me? .Seriously, how about that -girl
sitting over there, leok, she's very

pretty.v
- HARRY
Which one?
. HARMONY -

interrupting, I feel badly, at least let
"me buy you a——

' HARMONY
Bad.

- HARRY
Bad. Um, what s—s?

' .- HARMONY .
You feel bad. Badly is an adverb, so to
"feel badly" would be saying that the
mechanism which allows you to feel is
 broken.

HARRY
Well, then.
(clears his throat}
That girl over there, you said..?

 

 

HARMONY
WhiCh way you lookin' ..?
(shakes her head)
Nix,- nix, that's the blonde; blende' s
pathetic. ‘

HARRY

_Pathetic, I see. Because..?

HARMONY
Well, for starters, she's been fucked
.more times than she's had hot meals.

' HARRY
Right. I heard about that, it was neck
and neck, then she skipped lunch -~

HARMONY
‘Worst thing, though..?

HARRY
Do tell. _

HARMONY

Worst thing is she's 35 years old,-still

.trying to egg. -I see her in auditions;

Thirty—four.

__She grins.

It's over, baby, you missed. Get a clue.

HARMONY
Fucking asshole. I just needed a ride.-
(eats peanuts) .
Sorry. I swear a lot.‘ Did you know the
host? I didn't. .He looked really
familiar, though. Probably an actor.

 

Before he can reply, the FRIEND returns.

FEMALE FRIEND
Buzz, buzz. Go away, Mister fly.

HARRY
I'm talking to your friend here.

- FEMALE FRIEND
Yeah, well, she doesn' t wanna talk to
you. Leave.

‘ HARRY
Easy, Sunshine, I' 11 have her back to you
in a minute.

_ FEMALE FRIEND
-She doesn't have a minute.

He-starts.to retort —— bites it back. Whatfs the point?

HARRY
If you change your mind about that drink,.
I'll be over there with old Timothy
Hutton.

Harmony glances over -— blurts a LAUGH. Can't help it,
he's spot—on. Harry gestures to the bartender to coVer
the girls' drinks. Debates which credit card to use -—

' HARMONY grabs his VISA card. Makes it dance oh the bar:

‘ HARMONY
Pick me, pick mel'

(deep. bass voice: )
No, pick me'

-She grabs his MASTERCARD. Makes the two cards fight.'
'Harry looks at her like she's grown a tail. .She giggles.

FEMALE FRIEND
Stop it! Why are you humoring him?

It' s a recommended cheeseball hangout.

HARRY

Your mouth is a recommended place to put
a sock.

Princess... Scary friend... Goodnight.

He shrugs on his coat. Turns away. HARMONY, looking
more and more agitated, until, finally -—

HARMONY
Goddammit, Harry Lockhart, are you gonna
recognize me or not?

That stops him. He turns back, frowning. Squints —-

_ _ HARMONY
Embrey, Indiana!

Loved snakes, scared of spiders..?

HARRY
—— See, Jonny Gossamer wOuld always take
two cases,-right? Seemingly unrelated.
One‘s normal and the other, it's always
some wild shit; then at the end they're
connected, see, it's all one case.

. GAY PERRY .
Yeah, I get that all the time. Hey,
could you not root around in there——?

 

 

 

‘Harry's pawing through the glove box.‘ Extracts a small

nickel—plated DERRINGER. Whistles softly.

. HARRY
Tiny. Is it real?

. GAY PERRY
(nods)' -
Derringer. Fires three rounds. I call
it my "faggot gun."

HARRY
Because——?

GAY PERRY
Because it's good for three shots, then
you drop it and find something better.

-Harry's face contorts, like he just ate cat litter. He

replaces the gun. Perry chuckles.

- GAY PERRY
You asked, chief. Back to the lesson.
Our client, so you know, is one Allison
Ames, A—M—E—S, female. She's paying for
a video surveillance.

Harry dutifully takes out a pad, writes AMES.‘

- GAY PERRY

Stopped by her house today? Ms. Ames is
there with nothing on but a radio.
Lights a cigarette, sits in my lap...

HARRY
'Really?

Of course not, idiot. Hired me over the

not interesting. It's boring, write that
down, use like, three extra 0' s.

Agreed not to fuck my best friend Chock

That was nice of her. Okay. Stay put,

Perry bunkers forward, toward the wood—shingled house ——
at which point,-THE LIGHTS GO OUT inside.

' -Perry stops in his tracks. Ears pricked. Now what..?

The front DOOR begins to open. Perry BOLTS.‘ Back behind'
the woodpile, just in time ——

As a LARGE MAN exits the cabin. Crosses to his parked
car, whistling. A.hooded parka makes an.ID impossible.

HARRY .
Where the hell's he going?

How the hell should I. know? I didn't.

There. Up ahead. -

over under a canopy of pines. Perry shakes his head:

They trudge forward, into the frozen woods. CUT TO:
EXT. LAKE'S EDGE.-— NIGHT
The two men reach the end of a rutted dirt TRACK. The
trees give way abruptly —— Nothing. Only the lake.
They exchange bewildered looks. Birds call. Wind blows.

Where is he?

Just then, as if on cue -— a CAR ENGINE becomes audible.
Approaching through the woods at a good clip.

Get down. - ' 1

He grabs Harry, they both go over the embankment.
Stumble downward 30 feet. Perry clutches the video case.

Up top, the ENGINE, drawing closer. HEADLIGHTS, above'
them now... Keeps coming...- _Something's not right.

They realize simultaneously: the car's NOT SLOWING.
They DIVE for cover——£

Hit the dirt, HUG it, while above them TREES AND BRUSH
DETONATE, blasted to splinters as the CAR launches -—

 

 

 

32.

SAILS OUT INTO SPACE. Executes a lazy roll in mid—air...
SLAMS TO EARTH. Gouges it..!

Two feet from HARRY'S HEAD. Snow ERUPTS. :Slams him..
Fills his mouth. He rolls to water’s edge, looks up -—

Sees the vehicle BOUNCE, upside down... .0ut into.the
frigid lake. Impacts. Hood crumpled. Car, bobbing,

_headlights'spearing every which—way.

He can't remember getting to his feet, but suddenly HARRY
is moving forward. Vision blurred. Choking on snow.

Plunges into the water. Flaps and flounders to the car.

Driver side panel, at water level. He HEAVES —— wrenches
it open. Eyes darting left, right. Reacts, startled:

The car has no driver. Interior, empty. Registers
briefly that the GAS PEDAL is wedged to the floor.

Harry backs off, sputtering. Walk—stumbles toward shore,
NUMB, but now what's this, running.full out, it's PERRY ——

~YELLING something. Hard to hear, sound muffled...

GAY PERRY
Get the keys, in the ignition, THE KEYS!

Harry looks at him, half-witted —-
GAY PERRY -
The sound, the sound we heard, GRAB THE
FUCKING KEYS._

PERRY, blundering headlong through the water. 'Legs

-churning, as, without warning -— THE CAR GOES UNDER.

All in a rush, whboooosh..! ‘TRUNK, last thing to go ~—

Perry goes with it. 'Harry watches, thunderstruck, as the
detective PLUNGES into the freezing water. Vanishes.

.The surface appears pitch BLACK.

From underwater, a muffled report, BANG——! Pause.

”HARRY, helpless. 'He stares. Shaking with cold...

PERRY SURFACES. Comes swarming up out of the deep. Arms
locked AROUND SOMETHING, a sodden shape -— '-

GAY PERRY
'... Help me... God...d—dammit..!_

 

33.

HARRY is there, clutching Perry. Hauling him up, then
just as quickly recoiling -f -

As a GIRL IN A FLOWER DRESS emerges from the water like a

Kraken. Perry gestures frantically to GRAB HER ARMS.
Numbly, Harry complies ——

SHORE — SECONDS LATER

The GIRL flops from their grasp. Hits, lies still.
Hair, plastered across her face. PERRY collapses.

' GAY PERRY '
...L~locked in the trunk.. had to... to s—
shoot it open...

He looks over at her —— lets out an anguished sound.
POV PERRY: A dead doll in a flower—print dress.

HARRY
Is... is she dead..?

GAY PERRY
No... she's j— just... resting her eyes,
of COURSE she's fucking d~dead... her
Ineck is broken...

The girl's skirt is hiked, she has no underwear.
Harry tugs the dress down, a useless bit of chivalry.

' Perry scans the trees..-Reacts, startled ——

TWO MEN IN SKI MASKS staring down at him. He locks eyes

with one, briefly —— Then they BOLT. Into the trees.

AN ENGINE ROARS. -Squeal of tires as a CAR'drives off.

HARRY
That car we saw... you get the plate?

Didn't... b— bother..

HARRY
Me neither.

So, this sort of thing happen_a lot?

Perry shoots him a look.

HARRY
Easy, man, kidding. Come on, let's beat
it before the cops show.

GAY PERRY -
Nix. We... go straight to the COPS.

HARRY
Exactly, the cops, who will have no
trouble believing that she broke her
neck...
‘(points)
BEFORE-you shot her in the head.

Her face, what we see of it, appears beaten to a pulp ——
Scalp, deeply GOUGED by a bullet. .

Perry's bullet. He groans, buries his face in his hands._

-Wind, soughing... From the rippling lake, a soft
splash... Perry struggles to his feet. Shivering.

GAY PERRY
Okay. We're outta here.
, (frowns)
Where's my gun?

Harry shifts, uneasy. Swallows hard:

_ HARRY
I... I got rid of it.
GAY PERRY
Say again?
' HARRY

Just now. I threw it in the lake. I
figured, if you wouldn't do it, I would,

. I got priors in New York, man, I can't be
doing this —-

_ GAY PERRY
You threw it away??

He storms toward Harry ——
HARRY
Hey, take it easy——!

Perry stops. Takes a deep breath. Composes himself.

 

 

 

35.

GAY PERRY _
It's okay.- I... I get it, it's okay. I
just got a little non—plussed... Sorry.
(pauses, frowning)
Whoa. What the hell..?

Kneels beside the VIDEO case. Gingerly pokes at it:

GAY PERRY
What do you make of this..?

Harry leans in to look ~e Perry BOUNCES HIS HEAD off the
case. Leaves a dent.1 . ‘ .‘

GAY PERRY
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

Harry staggers backward, swearing. Grips his head.

-GAY PERRY _
You idiot! You threw my $650 vintage
revolver in the Goddamn lake, what about
when they comb the bottom, ever cross
your mind, they find that car, they'll
find the GODDAMN GUN???

 

He stands, runs a hand through his hair.

GAY PERRY
Jesus. Look up "idio " in the
dictiOnary; know what you'll find?

'PERRY drives. He's donned a dry pair of sweats. Beside
him Harry's still soaked, shivering. Perry's mood: foul.

They weren't there before; they're new.

Harry exits into a DOWNPOUR. Barely shuts the door,
Perry's driving off. Harry fumbles for his own keys ——

BRAKE LIGHTS. Harry looks up in time to see PERRY
reverse —— Pulls alongside again. Window slides down:

_ HARRY
Look, you don't have to apologize —-

GAY PERRY
Eat shit. You forgot this.

He holds out Harry's cel phone, which is RINGING. Makes
no move to let Harry in the car. Harry frowns. Leans
through the window. Answers the call, half in, half out:

He stands, rain drumming on his head.

HARRY
Killed herself with- a gun.

Harry's face tries on several different expressions.
Rejects them all. He looks out at the drowning city.

'guess things just, um, happen for a re~— .

HARRY enters, looking like someone turned a hose on him.

HARRY(V..O)
_I was tired, I was pissed, I was wetter
than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club. I
needed a hot bath, a warm bed.

(sighs)

But the night had other plans for me.
See, I forgot -— old Jonny, he always had
two cases,_ remember..?

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY — SAME

Christmas MUZAK plays. Harry, completely done in.

' -Dripping. He fumbles-for his key, rounding the corner ——

Jumps a foot in the air. Makes a startled "bark" noise.

She's there. Huddled in front of his door. Soaking wet, ”
shivering cold --

HARMONY. Standing there with puppy—dog eyes.' He stands
frozen. Breath suspended. Both of them, in tableau.

She finds her footing. MOVES. A rag doll.

Flops into him, ENGULFS him on impact... .The'two.of them

- resemble a very emotional SPONGE. HARRY, struck dumb.

REVERSE -— Tight on Harmony, on her FACE,_desolate...
Squeezing him for all she's worth. We hear HARRY:

, HARRY
... How..? I... I don't...

She answers him, voice uninflected, without hope:

 

 

 

40.

HARMONY
... she's gone, Harry...

Still in tight CLOSE— UP. A single tear escapes one eye
as it comes flashing back to her, all of it -—

FLASH: A CRIME SCENE.f CHEAP DOWNTOWN HOTEL ROOM

A police PHOTOGRAPHER'S flashbulb goes POP——! A female
form, sprawled in a corner. Covered by a SHEET.

Weapon, bagged for evidence —— a Mossberg shotgun.
FLASH TO: HARMONY, speaking to a Homicide cop:
HARMONY

I... I would've given her money. _But...
we haven' t.spoken... in years... _

COP '
Fact is, she stole not only_ a credit
card, but your ID as well —- We're very
sorry for the mix— up on our part...

(beat)
Are you willing, at this point, to make a
positive identification?

She nods. The barest edge of the SHEET, lifted for her ——

' HARMONY
There, the... the birthmark.
(swallows hard)
It's her. It' s_my little sister.

PRESENT DAY — INT} HARRYiS HOTEL SUITE — NIGHT

_ HARMONY paces jerkily to and fro. Scaked, shivering.
High on something or other. HARRY can't stop staring...

HARRY
Your sister's-been living out HERE?

HARMONY '
I didn't know; we hadn' t spoken... God,
in years. She never forgave me for
leaving her. I... thought she’d be safe,
I swear, no one told me Papa would get
her back ——

HARRY . . -
Look, first things first, you're gonna
catch-pneumonia, let m ~—

 

 

.41.

_ 'HARMONY
‘ will you listen?? I have to TELL this-,
someone has to believe me!

_ HARRY .

Fine, let me get a blanket, I'll ——
HARMONY

I don't need a blanket.
HARRY

'You' re shivering all over -—
HARMONY

I DON'T CARE.

Harry sighs.

’ HARRY

Okay. Deep breath. Tell me what

happened.
HARMONY

She got into my house. Yesterday, she

musta been broke, Swiped 200 bucks, a

credit card... California I.D.-God knows
_.what else. ' ‘ '

HARRY

-Back up. If yen two hadn't spoken in ——
_ HARMONY
Fourteen years.
HARRY

—- Fourte_en years, right, and she didn't
know where- you lived, how‘ d she know,
where to —-

' ,- HARMONY
I WAS ON TV, FOR CHRISSAKES. I was on'
the news, you can see_the house, see the
number, boom, right there; getting in's'
easy,-fucking robot broke the windows ——

Even as she's freaking out, Harry's drawn to the wet
dress, the pearling bead-s of water on skin...-

‘ HARMONY _
Harry, no more secrets; are you a
detective?

 

'42.

The question comes out of the blue. Harry blinks.

- "HARRY
Who told you that?

. - HARMONY
My friend Flicka... you said to her
you‘re a detective, and if that‘s.true I
need your help. If it isn't, goodbye.

Harry, caught totally off guard; how can he handle this?

HARRY
Right. Okay. First off, say I am é— why
me? Have you... looked at alternatives?
There's my colleague, Perry van Shrike —-

HARMONY
Perry, I know Perry, I’ve worked for him.
Please. He's gonna believe me? When I
tell him my sister didn't commit suicide?

Harry stops dead. Favors her with a look-of disbelief.
She leans forward, intent. Locks eyes with him, says:

HARMONY .
See? That's why I‘m here, Harry. .I
think my sister was murdered. I need
someone to help me prove it. ‘ '

_Stubs cut her cigarette. Begins to talk as we hear:

- HARRY (V.O.)
So I sat there, not looking at her
nipples while she told me about her
epiphany at the Rite—Aid on WilShire.

FLASHBACK: RITE—AID —_40 MINUTES PREVIOUS

Harmony, clutching a happy red basket. Soaked and
miserable; she's been crying.- Sees a bottle of Old
Forester. Into the basket, boom.‘ Steps to the checkout
counter. Looks down:

A) bottle of booze; B) three jars of sleeping pills.

'Casts about... grabs Twinkies, gum. Whatever's handy,
tosses stuff in without looking. Opens a Twinkie.

THE CHECKER runs her credit card... Shakes his head.
Tries again. Nope. Hands the card back, apologetic.

 

43.-

SNAP BACK TO PRESENT DAY: Harry, looking at her nipples --

(HARRY
Um, I’m sorry —- what were you buying..?

HARMONY - '
Whatever. Stuff. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
Don't you get it? The card she stole
from me was MAXED_OUT. Right before she
died, Jenna charged over 2000 dollars,‘
you don't find that a little weird..? To
.some bullshit company. Ah. Plus her _
birth control pill for today? Gone. Red
flag. Why'd she bother with her pill?

Still pacing, jittery, jerky; Harry shifts uncomertably.

HARMONY
So. Can you help me or not?

HARRY .
I'd have to check my schedule, but um ~—,

HARMONY
Can you..? Just tell me, I'll get the
hell out of your... your...

Without warning, her eyes lose focus, knees buckle —— She
promptly collapses. Harry has to CATCH her.

_He staggers, off balance. 'Shakes her —- Nix. Out cold.

He deposits her on the BED. Now what..? He grabs a
towel. Fluffs her hair. Steps back, frowning... She’s
shivering. '

It occurs to Harry,_ briefly, that he’s in much the' same
shoes as the asshole guy at Dexter‘s‘party.

Except she's gonna get fucking pneumonia. Shit.

He takes a deep breath. 'Tugs at her sopping dress.
Hauls it dripping up over her head. Looks down ——.

SEES THE SPIDER crawl frOm his pillow to her shoulder.

The size of a nickel, maybe (the spider, not the
_shoulder). Now it's bound fOr her NECK...

Harry, appalled. Leans in, takes aim... Goes to_flick
the beast, MISSES..{ It scuttles beneath Harmony's BRA. '

 

4'4 .

Son of a bitch. He gingerly taps the bra cup -— Hello..?
Mr. Spider..? Tap, tap._ The breasts therein jiggle
slightly. Harry takes a breath ——

: Very fast, and begging forgiveness he yanks up the bra-
Sees the black dot against a landscape of pink, FLICKS-—l

Sends it sailing. Heaves a sigh of relief...
Just as Harmony opens her eyes.

‘ HARMONY
What the hell do you think you're doing?

_ HARRY
. WHA..?? I... I-didn't do anything —-

HARMONY
You were feeling my tits.

- HARRY
What?? No, listen, there was a big
SPIDER, it was... it was... I...

CUT TO: ONE MINUTE LATER

HARRY, on hands and knees. crawling up and down, _
swearing. HARMONY,_under the comforter. 'Getting bored.

HARRY .
Hang on, hang on, you'll see. Where'd
you go, you -1ittle bastard... .

He changes directions. IHarmOny sighs:

HARMONY _
Look, it's okay, I believe you.

HARRY- . .
No. No, you don't. Just... hold on.’
It's here...

HARMONY
Look, whatever. Say you grabbed my tit,
it's..._it's life. No biggie. You got
any aspirin? '

Harry stops. Regards her in disbelief:
I _ HARRY '
A guy grabs your tit, "that's life..?"

No biggie? Christ, what kind of talk is
that? I-can't believe you're —~

 

 

 

45.

He stops, hearing Harmony GASP: She's looking down.

. Harry folloWs her gaze. She lets slip_her bra, exposes
one breast —— it's there: just visible,-if you squint...

A SQUISHED SPIDER_LEG. On.her aureole. Trailing buggy
fragments. She looks at him,'radiant... '

Granted, history has seen more romantic moments. 'Their
eyes lock, over the severed leg.- She offers a hand —-

- HARMONY
See there? I trust you.

—— But Harry refuses the offer.

. _ _ _ HARRY
Whatever. 'Ifm glad._‘

-Turns away from her.: Sullen. Agitated._

‘ HARMONY
What is it? I'm letting you off the '
hook, you didn't dg.anything ——

HARRY

Nb, but you thought I did.

' (spins on her:)
Listen to me, if I grab-your tit, it's a
BIGGIE, damn, that sounded wrong, what I
mean is, I'M ON_THE HOOK. ,The hook is
now my home! Meanwhile, you still talk
to me..? Like... like it's an okay
‘lapse, oops, everyone does it, Jesus,
what fuéking guys are you hanging around?
Are you just some... some girl who ——

He bites off the sentence. She looks stricken;

_ V HARMONY

Who what..? '
(beat)

Who what, Harry..?

'He retreats to (the BATHROOM.-
I HARRY ,
Look, just... forget I said anything.

Get some rest. Tomorrow we'll start
working on your case.

 

 

46.

HARMONY _
So... you can do it?. You're not too
jammed up with other clients?

. HARRY
Let me worry about that.

He shuts the bathroom door, blanches —- what the hell is‘
_ he doing? He's never gonna get away with this. Calls:

HARRY
Tomorrow afternoon good?

HARMONY (THROUGH DOOR)
Yeah, that's perfect. I'm borrowing some
sweats and a T—shirt. -

He unzips. Starts to pee. Rubs tired eyes... Reaches
over, opens the medicine cabinet. Fumbles for aspirin ——

The mirror nicely captures THE CORPSE IN THE TUB.

It swings into view. Sitting there mute, behind him.
It's the girl from the lake. RIGHT behind him.

'Flower dress. Hair plastered across her fishswhite face.

Harry, OBLIVIOUS “I tugging at the childproof cap...
Shakes out three pills. Pops them.ﬂ Looks in the mirror——

‘SPITS them the length of the room. He SPINS, staggers on
one foot. A burlesque arc of urine, preceding him.

Stands, blank. Utterly FROZEN. The poster boy for
cognitive-dissonance (yes, they have that.) _

Realizes, belatedly, that he‘s peeing ALL OVER THE
CORPSE. Stuffs himself away, cinches his pants, as'—-

__ - HARMONY (THROUGH THE DOOR)
Goodbye. I'm leaving..1 Harry..?

Harry says in a small strangled voice:

HARRY
Goodbye. -

'He-can't believe what he's seeing.‘

‘ HARMONY (THROUGH THE DOOR)
Thanks! This is really great.‘ 'Byel'

 

47.

THE THING continues to be there, whether the fuck it's
'believed in or not. Harry fumbles out his phone —-

- EXT. STREET — WITH GAY PERRY — DRIVING — NIGHT
Perry, phone to his ear, incredulous:

GAY PERRY-
Say it again, they gave her BACK??

INTERCUT - HARRY - IN THE BATHROOM

Okay. First things first, we gotta move

HARRY

Excuse me? - ’

GAY PERRY
If it' s a frame-up, some .asshole' s
probably calling the cops on you right
now. Do this: wrap up_ the body, a sheet,
blanket —- a rug if you. got_one.

HARRY - .
Just a second, I' m getting gloves. Any
particular kind? '

. GAY PERRY '
SHUT UP AND LISTEN. First: wrap the
body. Next, you have to find the gun.
Say it with me, "find the gun."

HARRY
Gun, 1... I threw it in the lake ——

GAY PERRY .

Not MY GUN, idiot.’ If they dropped a
body on you they also planted a gun,
‘trust me. move it. I'll be there_in

four minutes.

tires on the road behind it. He blows by camera, CUT TO:

A .38 REVOLVER

Underneath a sagging bed, as HARRY-utters a triumphant
GRUNT. Snakes out an arm, snags the gun, and meanwhile

DOWN IN THE LOBBY

Ding..! HARMONY steps off the elevator. Strides across
the lobby. Idle glance at the concierge —— There are
TWO COPS leaning on the guy's desk. Speaking tersely.

. - COP ONE-
——— caller specified room 314, some sort
of... brawl or something. Violent.

Whoa, she thinks, thatfs Harry's room. But violent..?
Hell, she was just there. Walks slower, eaveSdropping -—

CONCIERGE ‘
Yes, here we go. 314, Lockhart. Let me
give you the key. - -

_ At which point, Harmony surprises herself by suddenly
'blurting out to the Cops:

HARMONY
No, no, it's not 314. It's 514. I was

just up there, it‘s AWFUL, all those
noises.

. COP TWO
- Oh. Thank you, Ma'am. Appreciate that.

And on that note, Harmony, utterly perplexed, paSses -
through the revolving ENTRANCE DOOR, out into the chill.

Grabs her cel phone, she's gotta warn Harry and _
consequently FAILS TO SEE GAY PERRY as he blurs by,
behind her. In through the revolving door -— '

HARRY
No, that' s the other corpse, from the

He looks at Perry. Perry looks at him. They stop. BOTH
peer over the railing... Three stories, straight down.

EXT. PARKING LOT — GROUND LEVEL
A FLYING CORPSE hurtles into frame;

SLAMS down with a sick crunch. Camera pans up... Here
come HARRY & PERRY, scrambling down the stairs.

PARKING LOT — SAME

Keeping to the shadows, they lug the bundle toward-
Perry's CAR, over in a dark corner. Harry, straining:

HARRY
So these dudes tonight, they see two
asshole.s out of nowhere, they think ~—

GAY PERRY
They think we must know something, sure.
They panic. The body's evidence, they
lgotta dispose of it——

Harry follows with the GUN, chucks it, as THE POLICE CAR
swings into Sig-ht and without missing a beat Perry says:

GAY PERRY
Quick.. Kiss me.

_HARRY
What?

Perry plasters his mouth to Harry's. Harry, sputtering
in protest —— Perry locks him in an embrace.

THE POLICE CAR cruises past. A cop shines a flashlight ——

COP -
Check out Doris and'Lucinda over here.

His partner shakes his head. The car idles past... Turns
the corner.;. Gone. HARRY flings Perry away, sputtering:

HARRY ' '
Ack—-l Aaaagh——I All right! All right,
that's it.‘ These lessons suck, I quit,
this is not being a detective. Corpses
floating in lakes, people kissing people,
"this is... this is WRONG.

Perry clamps a hand over Harry' s mouth, SILENCES him.

._Out of the dark, A VOICE:

VOICE (0.8.)
Somebody want to fill-me in?

The two men SPIN ROUND, startled ——

HARMONY stands ten feet-away. Defiant. -Without missing
a beat, Harry turns, whispers_to Perry: -

Harmony heads into the park.

An afterthought, she loses the Santa hat._ Sadly, there' 3
still the costume: not so much deadly as- adorable.

INT. SUV - BACK WITH HARRY

In the backSeat, he sits up. Fully intends to transfer
to the front. Reaches for the door handle.

Scenery, spinning... Deep breath. Tries again...
tepples to the FLOORBOARDS, unconscious as

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD_
Up ahead, we see a form we recognize:

‘MR. FRYING PAN crosses from a gas station, sipping
coffee. Reaches the parked Impala, phone to his ear:

Uh—huh... Anybody around him-..?
Terrific... On my way. Got you a danish.

He clicks off. Gets in the car. Reaches in a pocket ——
Extracts a Sig_ Sauer AUTOMATIC, and meanwhile

EXT. WOODED PARK - WITH HARMONY

HARMONY, crouched low. .38 held loosely at her side.
Low MIST, inches off the ground. The lamps have HALOS.

She moves forward at a dead run. In and out through the'
trees. Eyes roving ——

Thatﬂs when she first notices THE GIRL.
25, give or take. 'Torn jeans. PINK HAIR. 'Punk—ish.

Harmony ducks behind a tree. Watches the girl stroll out
of the park. . ' ' -

Now Harmony sprints uphill to a ERICK WALL.

The one that borders the park. Roughly five feet high.
Finds she can stay to this side of it and still see the
STREET, where Pink-Haired Girl walks.

Still a block downrange. Harmony looks back at the park.
Reacts, startled: . '

New there's a strange MAN in the park.

Strolling south, eating peanuts. She fidgets. Peers
over the wall again ——

THERE HE IS, THERE'S PERRY

Coming out of a LIQUOR STORE two blocks down. Harmony
heaves a HUGE sigh of relief...

PERRY, meanwhile, sucks on a beer.

Ambles along, shadowing PINK—HAIRED GIRL; his _
aforementioned surveillance job. _No idea Harmony's near—-

Except shefs not so near, not anymore. She's 75 yards
away. She creeps along the wall. Keeping him in sight.

ANOTHER ANGLE - HEADLIGHTS

A car, nearing the park... 'She thinks nothing of it.'
_Glances up as it goes by, then promptly turns to STONE ——

THE BLUE IMPALA is back in the picture.

Gliding like an Angel of Death. She watches, terrified,
as it moves down the block. Closing on Perry.

The man with the peanuts TRIPS her.

She never saw him coming. All of a sudden she's

THAT gets Perry’s attention. Two blocks away, he SPINS ——

~ « SEES HEADLIGHTS ——_ Sudden and HUGE. ' -' 135.

What happens next happens quickly.

PERRY DIVES. Onto a parked car. Rolls across the hood,

' _nick of time as the Impala SIDESWIPES the car, -WHAM.—

and somehow

A GUN MATERIALIZES in his hand, like a magician' s trick
and WITHOUT A THOUGHT he sticks it out behind him and
while rolling, blows two shots backward at the Impala ——

WINGS THE DRIVER

Guy takes it in the shoulder, car_goes shrieking past and

" PERRY, NOW

VEER, crazily. Out of control. FIRES after it, three
more shots, starts to run. '

Up-ahead it strikes the curb, doing fifty ——

Blows its tires. 'CATAPULTS onto the sidewalk. Captures
a fire hydrant —— Buries itself in a LIQUOR STORE.

Shelves ERUPT. Wood, BLASTED to splinters. Finally

Heads for the door, running full out --

Unfortunately running in full View of the store OWNER,
who promptly blows the shit out of him. POW! POW! POW!

Drops him._ Guy dies more surprised than anything else.
And it's over, just that quick, and consequently GAY
PERRY simply reverses direction —— as the corpse topples

he's already loping back the way he came.

Car alarms SINGING their song. A geySer of WATER_
spouting thirty feet high, and meanwhile

EXT. PARK- —' ROADSIDE
' -PINK—HAIRED GIRL, on the run. Terrified.

.Gunfire, murder, this wasn‘t in the libretto. She sees
Harmony's SUV. Door open. Keys'dangling in plain sight.

Salvation. She jumps in, keys the ignition, goes roaring
off. Never bothers to check in back...

Where HARRY, uncOnscious, inhabits the floorboards.
INT. PARK — SAME TIME

PERRY shoves HARMONY over the brick wall.. Fellows a
seCond behind, into the PARK. '

GAY PERRY
The girl with the-pink hair. She ran
this way, did you see her? -

HARMONY
N... No. And the man, he... got away.
I... I couldn't shoot him.

 

81.

GAY PERRY _
-It's okay. You did great, you did just
fine.

SIRENS, now. Flashing LIGHTS, drawing near.‘ They
stagger off. The dark absorbs them. DISSOLVE_TO...

HARMONY'S SUV
As HARRY comes slowly awake. Groans. Disoriented. Sits

up. Extricates himself from the floorboards. Peers out”
the window: finds himself in- a tidy one—car GARAGE. ' |

 

TIME CUT: HARRY EXITS THE VEHICLE.

He takes his bearings. Totters toward the side dOor.
Past TRASH, brimming... He stops. Frowns. Backs up..

Focuses on one barrel. 'Paper, coffee grounds... A BAG.
'He pulls it free:. ALLEN' S VIDEO —— The Specialist.

Then another —— Rocket Video.l Another. Another._ Four
bags altogether. This is too creepy. He replaces them.

A SOUND. Harry whirls ——l
The DOOR’s opening. He reacts, darts behind the SUV ——

'Ms. PINK-HAIR emerges with a collie at her heels. Snags
a LEASH from a-wall peg. Exits to the street. Gone.

' The house is his.
THEISTAIRS — WITH HARRY

Harry moves upward, silently. Second floor. Peers into
rooms... Christmas TUNES, on the CD player. Drdning.

He finds them in the bedroom:

FOUR COPIES of Jenny GOssamer. 0n the nightstand. 20th
Century Fox, 1979. Well, I' ll be damned, he thinks_ --
Then FREEZES. Swears under his breath.

THE FRONT DOOR is opening again downstairs. No way. - '
Less than two MINUTES? Whatever the case, she's back ——

And SOMEONE ELSE is back. - Harry hears a male VOICE:
MALE VOICE (o. s. )

FirSt things first, you gotta get rid of
that car. Ditch it.

 

 

82.

Harry pokes his head into the hall -— Ducks back, fast.
They're on the stairs. Her head appears, she’s saying:

_ PINK HAIR
I'm sorry, I know you said there’d be...
consequences, but... I.. I saw that man
shot to death. I was so scared.

Coming to the bedroom. No time, no time to think -4 He
drops flat. Scrambles beneath the bed. Peers out:

Sees a set of pressed male SLACKS appear. Then JEANS,
sneakers; the girl. She sits on-the bed, Harry feels it.

MALE VOICE (o. s. )
Yes, of course, we should absolutely talk
about. it.

' - 'PINK HAIR‘
Thanks, thank you so much. It' s nothingI
against your boss, I... I' m_ grateful...

MALE VOICE .
I understand. Believe me. I spoke with
him, and you won 't have to do anything
like this ever again. Swear.

I PINK.HAIR
You mean it?” '

.MALEIVOICE-
Yup.

A phhhtttt—! of sound. Anether. An inch away, Harry
sees the carpet leap up—-I BOTH SHOTS penetrate_the bed.

It‘ s all HARRY can do to keep from screaming. He FEELS
her topple. She flops to the mattress. Rolls cffI the
bed. Strikes the floor. He recoils ——

She‘s-RIGHT THERE, inches away on the carpet.

Back arched spastically. Mouth open.

' -And eveh as he registers the bloody wounds, the fact that'
she's not gonna make it, her HEAD 1011s to one side,I eyes
wide in shock ——

SHE SEES HARRY. All of a sudden, sees a strange man-
under her bed. Maybe five seconds left to her. Says:

 

83.

PINK HAIR
Who... are you..?

Her eyes, inches from his. The two of them, close as
lovers... And Harry panics. Reacts instinctively.

Jams a finger to her lips. CUTS HER OFF.

_ Withdraws it. Presses it to his own lips. Eyes pleading
with her, please, oh, please be quiet...

Her mouth works soundlessly. The light.behind her eyes,
dimming. She looks to him, afraid, IMPLORING 4—

He wills her SILENT, that's right, honey, just for the
next few seconds, good girl...

Seconds are all she has. She passes them in pain_——

And then, obediently silent, she dies.

The lights go out. Her breath escapes. Harry having
-denied her a single word. This will haunt him for as

long as he chooses to live.

He shifts his attention: watches the tailored slacks exit
the room. «Hears something plank on the dresser top.

HARRY peeks his head out. Looks to the dresser -— There.
Sitting all by its lonesome: A silenced AUTOMATIC.

The'son of a bitch left his gun.‘

Harry breaks cover. Climbs to his feet. -Crosses to the
dresser. An automaton. Calmly claims the gun.

Checks-the safety. Flicks it off. Turns, hearing
FOOTSTEPS approabh. Grits his teeth. Bides his time -—

MR. FIRE DOESN'T SEE HIM at first. Appears in the
doorway, putting on gloves. Blanket, over his shoulder.

Then he-does see Harry.v Guy's a pro, gotta give it to
him. A flicker of reaction; that's all.

_ MR. FIRE:
Hey. You still around, tough guy? Got a
gun, I see. Damn. You are tough.

Harry DOUBLE TAPS, ba—bem——J Puts two in his gut.

 

84.

FIRE regards him in stunned disbelief. Looks down. 'Sees
red. Harry pauses, adjusting his aim --

Then he just keeps pulling the trigger, burning new
holes. SHOT AFTER SHOT. The guy jitters,-perforated ——

Flops against the stair rail. _Overbalances. Legs,
yanked up and over —— Plummets. Slams a glass coffee
table, explodes it. Bounces once. Hits, dead.
HARRY, THE EXECUTIONER

Watches SMOKE rise from the gun barrel. A song begins:
"I Saw IThree Ships.."

He kneels beside the dead girl. Grimaces as he wipes the“
gun and places it in her hand.

. HARRY
I'm sorry.

Actually? I'm from back east, I'm.
kinda digging the Geld ——

- ORDERLY
Or I can kill you here.

Perry sighs. Damn. It's never easy...
EXT. PARKING LOT

The guard marches them back toward the building.- The barrel
of the pistol jammed in Perry' s back. -. .

GAY.PERRY
(jovial)
You know, Harry, I was thinking
some more about .real life versus
ficItion.

. HARRY
Is that a fact?

 

 

100.

GAY PERRY
Like how, in movies, you stick a
gun in some schmuck's back, you
say,-“keep walking," and no sweat,
you got a hostage. .

HARRY
I do believe I‘ve seen that film.

GAY PERRY-
Funny thing is, a real pro insists on
five feet of separation, the reason
being... - .

Perry transforms to an urgent BLUR. Spins, lashes out~—l
SWIPES THE GUN, pretty as you like.

GAY PERRY
—— The schmuck will take it off you
and make you eat it.
(savage grin)
Down the hill. In those trees.
Now. -

DARKNESS - SHADOWY BRANCHES OVERHEAD

The GUARD falls -tolhis knees. IPerry' s got his own pistol,
Harry the revolver, andI no one' s in a particularly good mood.

GAY PERRY
Tell me where.Harmony is.

GUARD
Fuck you, Mary.

. GAY PERRY

Uh-oh. Pal, you don't get it.
This ain't good cop, bad cop. This
is Fag and New Yorker, you're in
deep trouble.

(sullen silence)
For Chrissake, what are you
protecting? It's over. 'Finis;
Dexter's going down. '

He begins ticking off items on his fingers.

GAY PERRY
I know about Ronnie's 1awSuit, I
know Dexter was facing ruin, and
killing her wouldn' t fix it.

'101.

GAY PERRY (cont'd)
(beat).
I know he switched daughters, _
- which, God help us, actually DID
work, at least until last week 4—

Harry chimes in:

HARRY-
Yeah, what happenedI, that he had to
kill her?

' Perry restrains.himself:-

GAY PERRY
Harry. You wanna put a sock in it?

HARRY'_
I'm just asking-:—

-.GAY PERRY
You don' t ask questions, now it
looks like I'm guesIsing, we don' t
know shit! .

. HARRY_ .
-Right, right. _Sorry.

. _ GAY PERRY -
And for the record, it was Ronnie's
old boyfriend. Guy'flying in from
.Paris, remember?'
(back to his prisoner).
Am I right?

I GUARD
FuckIyou.

- -GAY PERRY

Exactly. Dexter decided to cut and
run. Killed Ronnie, threw a dress ‘
on her. Faked a kidnap, dumped the

body and walked away clean. Except

for One thing. '

_- HARRY
Underpants. I
GAY PERRY
One lousy pair of cottOn undies.
Pretty funny, huh?

(chuckles)
I'm gonna break your nOse new.

I He palms the gun, SLAMS it heme.
GUARD, nose shattered. Perry cocks Ithe gun:

GAY PERRY I
Picture a bullet inside Your head,
chief. Right.here. Right now.

GUARD
Fuck you...
_ (spits blood)
And anyway, that' s ambiguOus..

GAY PERRY
Excuse me? How is that ambiguous?

. HARRY
I think he means that when you say,
"pictUre it inside your head;" '
okay, is that, a bullet will BE'
inside your head, or is it, picture
it in your head, like, form an
IMAGE, see what I'm saying?

- GAY PERRY
Will you shut up?

GUARD ,
Look. I don' t know about a girl.
-Serious-ly. -
HARRY
Yeah, yeah —— You know what, the
hell with this guy. Step aside.
Harry, galvanized, comes forward.
IDumps all five slugs from his revolver.
'Replaces a SINGLE BULLET in _the cylinder —- Spins iIt.
Steps past Perry. Kneels, says:

1 HARRY I
The girl. Harmony. WHERE IS SHE?

GAY PERRY I
What the hell are you doing?

Harry winks at Perry. Levels the gun ——

 

 

103.

_ HARRY
You wanna play hardball? Huh?
.FINE. I can do that. Where. Is.
THE GIRL??

Pulls the trigger, CLIC --!
Except it doesn’t go click.

Just like that. Bang-l He's wearing the guy.
GUNSHOT, echoing on the breeze...

A'frozen moment. PERRY, speechless.
The corpse topples sideways, clunk.

Harry, eyes wide. Shaking his head. -
No. Canﬂt be. It NEVER goes off the first time...

_ GAY PERRY
What did you just do??

HARRY '. ' ‘ -
No, that... that wasn't supposed to... I
only put one, one bullet ——

. GAY PERRY
You put a LIVE ROUND in that gun?

HARRY . ‘
I never meant to... There was, like, an
eight per cent chance, I just figured ——'

GAY PERRY
Eight per cent.

. HARRY
Well, maybe more...

GAY PERRY .
Eight per ce——WHO THE HELL TAUGHT YOU
MATH? '

Abruptly, Perry's cell phone BEEPS..! STARTLES them. "I

INTERCUT ~ GAY PERRY & HARMONY — ON THE PHONE

HARMONY (0.5.)

Just got in. I Was out buying a phone.
Are you okay? You don' t sound good -—

GAY PERRY
What... What about your lead ~—_

HARMONY (0.5.)
Oh, that. Ah, never mind, I had this
crazy idea, straight out of Jonny
Gossamer ——

GAY PERRY
It’s not Crazy. Don't talk, just listen:
call downtown, see if Ronnie Dexter’s
body has gone to the mortuary. Find out
=if there's aI cremation scheduled. Call
me back. ,

He clicks.off. Turns. Sees HARRY sitting, ashen-faoed
and trembling._ Hugging his knees.

GAY PERRY
Come on. He woulda killed you, he said
so. GET UP. We're through here..'

He grabs Harry's arm, yanks him to his feet, Turns,
storms uphill'to'the‘parking IIOt.

HARRY
What abOut this guy?

GAY PERRY -
I’ll get the car. You shot him,
'you drag him.
EXT. HILLSIDE — MINUTES LATER

Just below the lipI of the hill, Harry drops the corpse.
Calls up to Perry: .

 

 

105.

HARRY
"Okay. All set.
(brushes-himself off)
So, listen, I got an idea. Let's take
this son of a bitch Dexter down.

He crests the hill -— Stops. Draws a sharp breath:
HARLAN DEXTER himself is leaning against a car.
_ HARRY
—— um,_down to... the racetrack,
buy the son of a gun a drink, what
-do you say? Um, Perry..?
PERRY, TO'HIS LEFT

Hands behind his head, while Dexter' s bodyguard AURELIO.
,covers him with a short— barreled shotgun.

Harry shakes his head. Like a kid having a tantrum.

HARRY
No. Not fucking fair..l
DEXTER
Aurelio. Give Mr. van Shrike a pat—

down.

Aurelio steps forward, clearly not_thrilled. Starts to frisk
Perry._ The detective pretends delirium. Moans. Grinds his
hips. Aurelio YANKS free. Spits.

' AURELIO
Fucking maricon, shit.

Perry's CEL PHONE chirps again. He looks a question at
Dexter —— 1

1.1-; - DEXTER , _ y .
Toss it here. Let's see who it is.

Aurelio fishes out Perry-' 3 phone, tosses it —— Harry moves
without thinking. SNAGS it, hits the button, says:

HARRY
We're in trouble, Dexter's got us——
oooffl
A punch to the sternum, paralyzing —— Aurelio recbvers the

phone. Puts it to his ear,_LISTENS... Smiles.

 

 

, AURELIO
He just asked a carpet cleaning
service to save him.

DEXTER

Sorry, Harry. Good hands, thbugh.'

Blops them on Harry's testicles. DEXTER looks on.

HARRY
(playing tough)

The chick in the casket... she'ain't'even
gonna match the ringer you been toting -
around... Ever think of that, genius——?

GAY PERRY
(tiredly)

Of course he did, Harry. That's why he's

having the body cremated.

Dexter nods, impressed. Just then his phone beeps...

puts it to.his ear. Grunts. Hangs up.

DEXTER
Speak of the Devil. Gotta go.

. He shrugs into his coat. _Waves to Harry and Perry:

DEXTER-

Perry, nice to have known you. Um ——

_ HARRY
Harry. '

He

 

 

107.

. DEXTER _
Harry, of Course —— Glad to have met you,
hope you won't judge Los Angeles based
solely on your experience tonight. '

He exits. Heels, clocking away down the hall. As he
'departs, an ORDERLY ENTERS carrying an ominOus black BOX.

HARRY
(swallows hard)
’Hey, Perry... I, uh... I'm kinda scared
here, -man.

GAY PERRY
Aurelio, give the kid a break. Do unto
others, and all that. It's Christmas.

Perry squirms —- and instantly the gun trains on him. -
The ORDERLY attaches two trailing WIRES to the black box.

'For the record, Aurelio’s got another gun; this one a
plastic WATER pistol. Throughout, the sick—o spritzes
Harry every So often. Perry snarls at him:

GAY PERRY
-You like this, don‘ t you, you pseudo-
macho shithead? You know, you could zap
- this guy in the chest —— sure be
simpler...
(frowns) .
Hmmmm. Know what I think? I think you
like lookin' at his works.‘ Is that it—-?

-Aurelio PISTOL—WHIPS him. Perry grins savagely:

GAY PERRY
Dude, face it. You got it in you, man.

The ORDERLY looks to Aurelio —— Aurelio nods —- .He turns
up the rheOstat. HARRY SCREAMS. Thrashes.

PERRY, seemingly impassive. A TIC betrays him.- He
begins to FLEX the fingers of his hand, over and over...

EXT. LEHRMAN BROS. MORTUARY — ESTABLISHING — NIGHT

A TRANSPORT VAN backs toWard the mortuary doors. Arrayed
around- the van, four DUDES, all natty in DARK SUITS.
Ostensibly mourners ——_oh, please. Drug addicts.

MEANWHILE, ACROSS THE STREET 4 WITH HARMONY

 

 

 

 

108.

She coasts to the curb. Lights off. Peers out -—

As HARLAN DEXTER, NOW, pulls into the mortuary lot. One
of the apes approaches ——

APE V
Mr. Dexter, sir. The coffin's here.

He looks up. RAIN, starting to fall... Nods, says:

DEXTER
Let's-burn the bitch.

INT. DEXTER_CLINIC — "THERAPY ROOM" — SAME

_ Aurelio speaks calmly to Harry, GUN never leaving Perry:

- . AURELIO - _
Who. Else. Knows..? Who did you_tell?
- HARRY -
No one, I... I swear... I don't even LIVE

here...!

Another twist of the dial. HARRY arches backward. The
current abates. He sags, semi—conscious. Comes round,
gagging, coughing -- And that's it. Gay Perry's had it.

GAY PERRY
ENOUGH. Aurelio, look me in the eyes.
Look me in the eyes and say the words, "I

have never had a man." Come on, do it.
AURELIO
Fuck you, maricon.
GAY PERRY
Is that a yes..? I didn't hear you.
AURELIO‘ '-
I will enjoy having you as a patient._
GAY PERRY
You believe this, Harry? He can't say
it. _
' AU'RELIO

Enough. SHUT UP.

Why can't you just say it? Huh? If
you're not gay, tell me. JUST TELL ME.

'Cause you CAN' T. You've done it, you' ve
smoked pork, and you DAMN WELL KNOW IT.
(grins)
Listen to me, you piece of. shit, I-' ve
seen it from Day One, you WANT me -—

PERRY JAMS HIS HAND down the waistband of his slacks;

_ GAY PERRY ,
Here it is. You want some of this? Come
over here. You want a shot of this??

AURELIO
Shut your Goddamn mouth—4!

He springs forward, GUN poised for a savage blo ——

Doesn' t feel it at first; doesn’ t realize his kneecap' s
exploded.

'A TONGUE OF FLAME leaps, unbelievably, from between
Perry's LEGS.

Aurelio blinks, dumbfounded. Catches on quick_——
' 1A3 THE DERRINGER fires again.

Takes him in the head. -Drops him —— Perry's moving
befOre the body hits. Jerks his legs upward. SPINS —— '
Swivels on his ass,_one smooth motion, FIRES-l ‘

Wounds the orderly. Downs him. Then he's up, crossing
toward HARRY —— who's staring in comic disbelief. Perry
reveals his little 3-shot gun, it emerges from his pants.

GAYIPERRY
Homophobes never search there.

HARRY _ '
Thank God you... had a gun in there...
For a second, I thought.it was... a gay
thing, somehow... you guys just DID that.

GAY PERRY
Can you stand? Walk? '

- HARRY
Neither.

electric, baby.
’Harry groans. Reaches dOwn... Pulls up his pants.

He heads for the door, Harry's arm slung rcund him.
EXT.-MORTUARY — PARKING LOT — RAIN, A DOWNPOUR
Dexter's SUITS, huddled just inside the building.

Suits Harmony just fine. She approaches the VAN DOOR,
undetected. Lifts the handle -- .

INT. VAN — CARGO AREA'

In here, the DRUMMING is cacaphanous. Harmony spots the
COFFIN in back.‘ Wriggles next to it, raises the lid.

lClicks a penlight, directs it down —— a reverent whisper:

INT. SUV —_WITH HARMONY

The PHONE RINGS, startles.her. Built into the van, a
hands free intercom. Rings again. She fumbles for it:

We're on Olive, by the freeway, any way
you could ——

I'm thirty seconds away. Be where I can
see you, be ready to move.
She glances in her mirror, draws a sharp breath -- A

BLACK SEDAN, closing fast.

HARMONY .
Shit._ They're on my tail, gotta_go.

She hangs up. Stashes the.phone. RAIN, coming in sheets
now. obscuring the road.

 

Up ahead —— FREEWAY. She checks the mirror. They're
closing fast. She tromps the pedal, BLAZES forward...

The SEDAN RAMs-HER from behind.

She swears. Fishtails madly. .The van crosses the center
line. SKIDDING.. She snaps around, facing forward ——

A PICKUP TRUCK. Bearing down. She screams——! Cuts the

EXT. ROAD - NEARBY _

Comes down, wham-—!_ Atop the big GREEN FREEWAY SIGN.

The COFFIN BURSTS OPEN, not .11 the way ——
Enough to admit one trailing HAND.

One dead girl's hand dangling limp over the-freeway.
Spotlighted. Festooned with Christmas lights.

The guy reacts: spins, smoothly, GUN coming up...

Jesus, get down!!

Events proceed in the following-order:
GAY PERRY

Flings himself in front of Harry. One continuous move, gun
materializing, blooming ——

Perfect. Perry takes out the gunman. Blows him down.

Unfortunately, in the last second of his life, the unhelpful
badguy fires back...”

Also dead on target. -Perry's chest registers impact.

Bang—bang, everybody gets hit.' Fuck. In three seconds,
the entire world changes.

First the GUNMAN gOes down, drilled through the neck.
Then PERRY grunts, staggers. ,PIERCED. . I
'Still not done. The slug burns through him, EXITS...
Keeps on GOING ——

HITS HARRY.-

Upper thigh. A soft smack of sound.' He's puzzled at first.
Suddenly SEATED. Punched by an invisible fist ——

SEEN FROM AFAR

Two tiny figures collapse in the rain.
A third plops flat on his ass.

I Three stark seconds. Awkward, brutal.

Perry's not getting.up.j

MEANWHILE, THE SEDAN TAKES OFF

Sweeps out onto the boulevard, slewing rain as

Crawls toward Perry, who lies slack and unmoving.
He stares, incredulous. ‘No. Wrong.

As if in response, the GUN slips from Perry's hand...

'PUSH IN ON HARRY —— Staring, dumbstruck.

In her little world. She lies, semieconscious..-

YSISOmething tells him to cast a look DOWNRANGE, he does ——.
HIS POV: 1/4 MILE AWAY I

Oh, shit. THE SEDAN isn't through yet. It's slowing,
swinging onto an on—ramp —- Heading BACK this direction.

Back to finish off Harmony.

AHarry freaks. stumbles to his feet, .38 Half out of his
pocket. - He staggers forward. Flustered. Panicked.

SLIPS..! Legs, whisked out from under. Down he goes.

Hits HARD.. Cries out in pain. His thigh, SHARING.
Tries to sit up._ Groans. Flops in‘a puddle ——

BELOW, IN THE TUNNEL — WITH HARMONY
She lies, a seeming corpse...-Only her lips, trembling:

Sees Perry's PHONE, lying dented. Numbly regards the
flashing ID window —— Who the hell..?

HARMONY, it says. Beyond sense or reason, he depresses
the button; - -

He frowns. 'STATIC at first... Then, scarcely audible...

HARMONY (0.3.) _
Harold... use... awesome might... ~

The words richochets in his awareness.

HARMONY -
Save me from this... hopeless plight...

.Resonating.' He closes his eyes. Oh, Christ...

In the downpour, he plants his elbows. Levers himself
up. Grits his teeth. Gets a knee under him. PUSHES.

Trembling, he stands. Draws himself to his full height.
Soaked, bleeding. Hands shaking.

staggers to the overpass WALL. Head dewn. Bleary.
'LIGHTNING flares-—! Fills the sky. Etches HAROLD in
'sharp relief. He looks out upon the zipping VORTEX.
-Reaches in his jacket for his .38-

-Oh, shit. He's gonna try it from up HERE.

THUNDER rolls. He swipes rain from.his eyes. Braces the
.38 on the overpaSs. Draws down on the incoming car...

Takes dead aim... So focused, he.almost doesn't hear it.

At first, a purr... then a burgeoning roar... Turn
around..! He whirls ——

A speeding car. ANOTHER ONE, he's stunned ~-

HARLAN DEXTER. Right-on TOP of him. It’s finished, he
hasn't a fucking chance.

Harry doesn't think. Simply flings himself UP AND _
SIDEWAYS, as the car SLAMS THE WALL where his legs were.

 

117.

Mr. Agility, our boy -— Only one problem: he can't. STOP
himself. Momentum, too great, simply keeps on rc_lling ——

URIGHT OFF THE EDGE into space, into- open AIR, tumbling -—

WIND, rushing... CARS, blurring past...

Slams headfirst.into the big green FREEWAY SIGN.

.Collides with it, arms flailing. .Clutching desperately ——

DAMMIT.- No traction, too WET-—! Last chance ——

CATCHES HOLD. Got it. Unbelievably, lurches to a stop.
He dangles, kicking... _

Hanging onto RONNIE DEXTER'S DEAD HAND.

And maybe, for a lunatic second, we think she reached
from beyond the grave, that she's the one clutching him ——

A lover's grip, as she SUSPENDS-him above the freeway.

HARRY blinks away rain. Gasping. His .38 REVOLVER
stayed up above. On the EDGE, barrel protruding...

He casts about, despairing. Something,_anything...

The overpass starts to VIBRATE. Remember page 5, the
thing that began this mess..? It's okay, I don’t either.

In any event, at that moment, a CITY BUS RUMBLES PAST...

ON THE REVOLVER: it jitters... vibrates. .. FALLS.

HARRY moves fast. The GUN whistles by —- Out of the dark _
‘comes a magic—quick.HAND. Rain—slick, minus a finger ——

Plucks the weapon from thin air. Impossible.
Reels it in. SPINS it. Acquires the TRIGGER. A
magiCian' s calm, a ROBOT' S precision. Teeth gritted,

raises his arm ——

The next 15 seconds, very strange indeed.

IUP ABOVE HIM

DEXTER appears, drawing a weapon. HARRY jerks his head
upward. RAIN,- sheeting_down... ' .

Sees the man. FIRES UPWARD..1 Kills him.

Dexter topples over the side. Plummets, STRIKES -the
coffin, BOUNCES——1 The coffin shifts, precarious...

I ABRUPTLY DROPS. Plunges 5 feet. Stops, ka-chuke—J

Harry's dangling LEGS, now easy prey, A PANEL TRUCK
clips his FOOT,_jars him. Still he hangs on e-

Clutching the dead girl's hand, grimacing in pain... HE
DRAWS DOWN On the speeding sedan. HARMONY, stirring...

HARRY
HARMONY! 1

He TRIGGERS A SHOT. BANG. Echoing in the night. BANG.
Another. Nothing. Car window down, GUN emerging ——

And so, drenched in rain, battered and broken, Harry
quits playing and simply slays the motherfucker. Bang.

Driver, killed. Car VEERS. Smacks an abutment,
RICOCHETS and meanwhile —— . .

HARRY CAN‘T HOLD ON, he loses his grip, plummets...
BUCKLES THE ROOF
Of the sliding SEDAN. Strikes it dead center.

Rolls his-head. An inch from his nose: the back window.
Frosted with blood inside. Like a malted glass.

Feels the car come to a HALT; watches, oddly detached, as
THE PASSENGER

Gets out, a foot away. Sees HARRY. Goes for his pistol
and Harry just flaps the .38 at him —~
HARRY
No.

The gun KICKS in his hand. There, he killed that guy.
Lost count. A_BULLET SPIKES UPWARD through the roof.

Oops..1 Forgot one. Harry, annoyed... Jams his muzzle
to the rootop, fires downward. .Bang, for Chrissakes..
Pest, gone.

_What we're watching isn't gory; it's flat—out METHODICAL.

Harry, alone now... sprawled out atop the car. Drenched.”
Staring at all the pretty colored LIGHTS...

She nods. Spots a mid-chest RUPTURE in Harry's jacket.

HARMONY

You wanna... see something cool..?

Painfully, he reaches_into his pocket... The EXACT SPOT
the bullet hit —— withdraws a paperback! JONNY GOSSAMER.

HARMONY

‘Way cool! It stopped a bullet!

HARRY
Um... well, not really...

Truth is, bullet went-straight through, left a hole like

You feeling okay?- How are your-~?

Indicates his-groin area. Harry groans:

HARRY-
I can't believe he told you about that.-

There‘s a TAP—TAP at the door, they look up —— GAY PERRY.
Wheelchair bound. He rolls himself over the threshold.

HARRY
Hey—hey! Where's my present, slick?

GAY PERRY
You're not in fucking jail, that's your
Goddamn present.- Hello, Harmony.

Suddenly the NARRATION CUTS IN, it's Harry, saying:

. - HARRY ._(V.O.').-
Yeah, boo—hiss,.I know —— Look, I hate itu
too. In movies where the studio gets all‘
paranoid about a doWner ending,_so the
guy shows up, he's, like, magically
ALIVE, on crutches, I hate that. I mean,

' shit, why not bring 'em ALL back..?

As he's speaking, the dead PINK—HAIRED GIRL enters...
_Followed by FIRE and FRYING PAN, then a LABRADOR with an
Old Yeller sign around its neck, then ABRAHAM LINCOLN —-

- HARRY (V.O.) _
But the point is, see, this time it
really happened, Perry like, lived. And
yeah, it's a dumb movie thing —+ but what
do you want me to do, lie about it?.

A NURSE hurriedly Shoes everyone out except Perry.” Our
trio, alone. HARMONY turns to Perry. Eager, ekpectant:

' . HARMONY
You found something-out?
- GAY PERRY
Yeah. >I got the scoop. All of it.
You're, uh, not gonna like it.
Now he's got their full attention.‘ Clears his_throat:

_ GAY PERRY
' Dexter didn't murder your sister.

121.

Harmony stares, mouth working... shakes her head:

_ HARMONY .
No... that's crazy, you know it. He was
using her to impersonate his daughter —-

_ GAY PERRY
Never happened. Talked to my police guy.
The ringer' s name was Mia Frye, age 23. ‘
Lived in Glendale. When she wasn' t
playing Ronnie Dexter, she wore make—up
and a pink wig.
HARMONY
(uncomprehending)

- But... my sister, she... she sent you up
to Big Bear, to his cabin...

GAY PERRY'
Your sister had become convinced Dexter
was her natural father. She hung around,
watched him, even met the Frye girl, the ;
impersonator.
(beat)
You see where I' m gOing with this?

FLASH TO: A MOONLIT VERANDA

The image of Harmony' 5 sister JENNA, her back to us,.
creeping forward to peer through a WINDOW.

I At figures, ENTWINED. Naked.' One of them, we see, is
PINK—HAIRED girl. For now, the WIG resides on a table.

GAY PERRY (V.O.)
'One night, your sister came calling
' and... saw them. Together. Saw Dexter
in bed with his own _gughter, remember,'
that's how it .would appear.

JENNA stumbles backward-from the window, turns, BOLTS...

HERE AND NOW: Perry takes Harmony's hand:

GAY PERRY
Both fathers. First the old one, now the
shiny new one- -- it was too much. Seeing

it... triggered repressed memories, tore
the lid off Pandora's box...

(beat)
She took her own life.

SNOW, SWIRLING, AN INFINITY OF IT

Fields stretch far and away.' Flat, unbroken. We see a
small clutch of MOURNERS around a grave. -SUPER}

"FAREWELL, HY LOVELY — EPILOGOE
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM — TOWN MED CENTER — SAME

A bed cOntains a withered OLD MAN. HARRY steps in.
Looks down at him, says quietly:

HARRY -‘ -
She never had a chance, did she, Pops..?

Pause... the old man's eyes narrow.

, HARRY
Funny. I thought I might feel sorry for
you when I saw all these tubes and shit.

HARMONY'S DAD
(glowering)
Do I know you..?
HARRY
-Nah, I doubt it. I'm no one.

HARMONY'S-DAD
What do you want? '

HARRY
Nothing much. It's just, the zoo was
closed and I wanted to see an animal.

HARMONY'S DAD
Son of a..! Who do you think you're'
talking to? I buried my daughter today.
HARRY '
Actually, you lay here with your thumb up
your ass, sweetheart. Struggling to stay

He leans in close. Face etched in anger:

HARRY

HARMONY'S DAD
Who are you?? I... I loved my girls_--

Harry slaps him. HARD. The old man gasps. sputters:

V HARMONY'S DAD

HARRY

BACKHANDS him. Head, snapped sideways—41 Pillow
spritzed with blood. Harry turns on his heel. Walks.

himself... Big tough guy... -

At the'door, Harry turns, SMILES. Nods.

Exits.

INT./EXT.-HOSPITAL LOBBY — TWILIGHT — WITH HARRY
Crossing the lobby, he glimpses a TV in one corner.
' 'HIS POV: A BIG BROWN BEAR tosses a beer and says:'

'BEAR _
Me, I prefer Genaro's... but hey, what do
I know, I suck the heads off fish!

A GIRL catches it. VNOT HARMONY.- Someone years younger.
Harry smiles ruefully. Exits into the chill twilight.

Outside, she waits —- HARMONY. Harry stops beside her.

' HARRY
Helluva sunset. -

HARMONY _ -
L.A.'s are nicer. It's the pollution.
Smog causes atmospheric diffusion of
light. ' - .
. (pause... then:)
Was he awake? .

. HARRY
Yeah. He was awake.

 

 

125. '

. HARMONY
Did he say anything interesting?
- HARRY
No. Nothing.
HARMONY

(nods, chews her lip)
I only wish she could give me a... a
SIGN, just... some way to let me know.
(off Harry's look)
... that she forgives me.

At that moment there_is a sputter, a FLICKER..1

All the Streetlights come on. .
Harmony blinks. stares.> Harry laughs.

He draws a deep breath of crisp winter air. Feels
alive... And young. As the day he was born.
