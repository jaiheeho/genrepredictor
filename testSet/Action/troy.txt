FADE IN:

EXT. THESSALIAN VALLEY — DAY 1

A mangy, bone—thin DOG lopes across the broad valley
floor, sniffing at the ground. At first the scene
appears bucolic: tall grass, patches of wildflowers, blue
sky above.

But as the dog keeps running we see signs of conflict. A
spear, half imbedded in the earth, rises at an angle. A
bronze helmet, cracked and bloodied, lies on its side.

The dog pauses to sniff the helmet then continues his
search. Finally he stops, hackles on his back rising,
ears pricked up. He growls, and we see what the dog sees.

Dozens of CROWS have descended into a shallow ravine.
They squabble and peck, clustered around something on the
ground.

The dog growls louder and charges at the crows. The black
birds flap away to safety, shrieking in protest.

A DEAD SOLDIER lies facedown in the ravine. Whatever
armor he wore was stripped away, leaving his body to the
elements.

The dog walks slowly to the dead man, sniffing at the
corpse's hands. The dog whines and licks the man's
fingers.

Something in the air disturbs the dog, who looks up. And
now we hear it, faintly, in the distance. HOOF BEATS and
chariot wheels, marching men, the clank of bronze armor
and weaponry.

The dog runs, abandoning his dead master.

THE MYCENAEAN ARMY 1A

five thousand strong, storms into the valley from the
south. Armored with bronze breastplates, helmets and
shields, the soldiers glitter in the morning sun.

Riding alongside the infantry are dozens of horse—drawn
CHARIOTS, each holding a DRIVER, a SPEARMAN and an
OFFICER.

On the opposite side of the valley, three thousand
THESSALONIAN SOLDIERS march into View. The Thessalonians
are less disciplined, their armor and weaponry less
impressive.

CONTINUED: 1A

When each army reaches the battlefield they stop and stare
one another down, two hundred yards distant.

A MYCENAEAN CHARIOT AND A THESSALONIA CHARIOT lB

emerge from their respective sides and meet at the center
of the field.

AGAMEMNON, king of the Mycenaeans, rides in his chariot
with a DRIVER and a SPEARMAN. Agamemnon holds a gold
SCEPTER, symbol of command. His breast plate is engraved
with an Alpha.

His counterpart in the Thessalonian cart, TRIOPAS (60),
does not project equal confidence. He eyes the size of
the Mycenaean army with evident unease. He holds his own
SCEPTER.

Both kings step down from their chariots and approach each
other. They stare at one another for several seconds.
Agamemnon smiles and looks into the sky.

The crows wheel overhead, cawing.

AGAMEMNON
It's a good day for the crows.

TRIOPAS
I told you yesterday and I'll tell
you again today. Remove your army
from my land.

Agamemnon smiles again and turns to examine the valley.

AGAMEMNON
I like your land. I think we'll
stay.
(beat)
I like your soldiers, too. They
fought bravely yesterday. Not
well, but bravely.

TRIOPAS
They'll never fight for you.

AGAMEMNON
That's what the Messenians said,
too. And the Arcadians. And the
Epeians. They're all fighting for
me, now.

(CONTINUED)

lB

CONTINUED: lB

TRIOPAS
You can't rule the whole world,
Agamemnon. It's too big. Even for
you.

Agamemnon surveys Triopas's army.

AGAMEMNON
I don't want to watch another
massacre. Let's end this war in
the old manner.
(beat)
Your best fighter against my best.

For the first time, Triopas looks hopeful.

TRIOPAS
And if my man wins?
AGAMEMNON
We'll leave Thessaly for good.
(beat)
I'm a generous man. If mine wins,

you keep your throne. But Thessaly
falls under my command, to fight
with me whenever I call.

Triopas considers before nodding. He shouts to his army.

TRIOPAS
Boagrius!

The Thessalonians murmur and step aside. A giant emerges
from their midst, BOAGRIUS, a foot taller than the other
men, his face gouged with old knife scars. He marches out
to his king.

TRIOPAS
Here is my champion.

Agamemnon raises his eyebrows as the giant comes closer.

AGAMEMNON
(shouting to his army)
Achilles!

The Mycenaeans murmur amongst themselves, looking for
Achilles. Nobody emerges. Agamemnon frowns.

TRIOPAS
Boagrius has this effect on many
heroes.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2) 1B
AGAMEMNON
Be careful whom you insult, old
king.

An OFFICER on horseback gallops from the Mycenaean ranks
to the center of the field. He bows his head to
Agamemnon.

OFFICER
Achilles is not with the army.

Triopas laughs and looks up at Boagrius, who chuckles.

AGAMEMNON
(furious)
Where is he?
OFFICER

I sent a boy to look for him.

EXT. WOODS — DAY 2

A BOY (12) on a roan HORSE gallops through the woods.

EXT. MYCENAEAN CAMP — DAY 5

The boy rides into the camp. Scores of tents stand on the
banks of a river. The only men around are COOKS tending
fires and ARMORERS, mending armor and weapons.

The boy dismounts at one large tent in the corner of the
camp. He pulls open the tent flap and steps inside.

INT. ACHILLES' TENT — CONTINUOUS 4

The boy pauses for a moment inside the tent, eyes
adjusting to the dim light. Evidently last night was a
wild party. Jugs of wine are everywhere, and the remains
of a large feast.

Sleeping on a fur rug are two NAKED WOMEN and one NAKED
MAN, tanned arms and legs entwined. The boy sidesteps
shards of a broken jug. He bends to tap the sleeping
man's shoulder.

Before his fingers make contact, a hand shoots out, grabs
his wrist, and pulls him to the rug. The boy finds
himself flat on his back with a dagger to his throat.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 4

ACHILLES
Shh.

The boy stares into the eyes of ACHILLES (50), who seems
to have barely moved. Somehow he managed to seize the boy
and put a knife to his throat without waking the women.

ACHILLES
(whispering)
I was having a good dream.
(beat)
A very good dream.

The boy nods, dumb with fear. Achilles has the lean,

efficient physique of a boxer. His face and body are dark
from a summer spent in the sun.

BOY
King Agamemnon sent me. He
needs ——

ACHILLES
I'll speak with your king in the
morning.

BOY
But my lord —— it is morning.

Achilles frowns. He stands and walks naked to the tent
flap, holds it open and stares at the empty encampment.

BOY
They're waiting for you.

EXT. MYCENAEAN CAMP 5

Achilles prepares for battle, strapping on his
breastplate. The boy assists him, fixing the bronze
greaves to his legs.

BOY
Are the stories about you true?

They say your mother is an immortal
goddess.

Achilles lifts up his shield. He slips his left forearm
into the leather straps on the inside of the shield.

BOY
They say you can't be killed.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 5

ACHILLES
I wouldn't be bothering with the
shield then, would I?

BOY
The Thessalonian you're fighting
—— he's the biggest man I've ever
seen.

Achilles mounts the boy's horse.

BOY
I wouldn't want to fight him.

ACHILLES
That's why no one will remember
your name.

Achilles gallops away, leaving the boy standing alone.

EXT. THESSALIAN VALLEY 6

Agamemnon confers with his OFFICERS on the battlefield,
including KING NESTOR (65), his trusted advisor.

When Achilles rides into view the Mycenaean soldiers
CHEER. Some cry out his name. Agamemnon and his officers
turn to watch Achilles dismount and approach them.

AGAMEMNON
Perhaps we should have our war
tomorrow, when you're better
rested?

Achilles ignores the king and examines the waiting giant.

AGAMEMNON
I should have you whipped for
impudence.

Achilles wheels on the king.

ACHILLES
Who's giving the whipping?

He walks toward Agamemnon, fingers curling over the hilt
of his sword. Nestor slides in between Achilles and the
king.

NESTOR
Achilles.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Achilles, nostrils flared, eyes narrowed, stares at
Agamemnon. Neither man is willing to turn away.

ACHILLES
(to Agamemnon)
Why don't you fight him yourself?
Wouldn't that be a sight, a king
who fights his own battles?

NESTOR
Achilles.

Achilles finally turns and looks at him.

NESTOR
Look at the men's faces.

Achilles surveys the faces of the battle—weary soldiers.

NESTOR

You can save hundreds of them. You
can end this war with a swing of
your sword.

(beat)
Think how many songs they'll sing
in your honor.

(beat)
Let them go home to their wives.

The soldiers, awed in his presence, stare at Achilles. He
finally turns and walks toward Boagrius.

Agamemnon watches Achilles with undisguised hostility.

AGAMEMNON
(to Nestor, under
his breath)
Of all the warlords loved by the
gods, I hate him most.

NESTOR
We need him, my king.

AGAMEMNON
For now.

ACHILLES 6A

When Achilles is forty yards from the giant, Boagrius
turns to his army and shakes his spear over his head.

They cheer, slamming their bronze swords against their
bronze shields.

(CONTINUED)

6A

CONTINUED: 6A
Achilles keeps coming. He looks up at the circling crows.

Boagrius turns and throws his spear. The bronze spearhead
glitters in the sun, blazing straight for Achilles.

Without breaking stride, Achilles raises the shield. The
spearhead blasts through the bronze skin of the shield,
through the thick leather on the underside, stopping
inches from Achilles' face.

Achilles keeps coming.

Boagrius hoists a second spear and hurls it, grunting with
effort. Again Achilles raises his shield, again the
spearhead tears through the shield but does not harm
Achilles.

Achilles casts aside the shield and keeps coming.

Boagrius unsheathes his tremendous bronze sword. He opens
his mouth, lets loose a battle cry, and charges at
Achilles.

When Boagrius raises his sword, Achilles lunges forward
with terrifying speed. It does not seem possible that he
could close the gap between them so quickly, but he does,
thrusting his sword straight through Boagrius'
breastplate.

Achilles pulls his sword from the giant's chest and
continues walking toward the Thessalonian line, never
looking back.

Boagrius stares down at the hole in his breastplate.
Blood pumps out, pouring down the polished bronze. He
topples over.

The Mycenaean Army ERUPTS with exultant victory cries.
Achilles now stands in front of the massed Thessalonian
troops. He searches from face to face. None of the
soldiers are willing to make eye contact with him.

Finally Triopas steps out of the ranks.

TRIOPAS
Who are you, soldier?

ACHILLES
Achilles, son of Peleus.

(CONTINUED)

6A

CONTINUED: (2) 6A

TRIOPAS
Achilles. I won't forget the name.

Triopas offers Achilles the heavy gold SCEPTER.

TRIOPAS
The ruler of Thessaly carries this
scepter. Give it to your king.

ACHILLES
He's not my king.

Achilles walks west, away from both armies. The soldiers
watch him go in silence.

EXT. IONIAN SEA — DUSK 7

We're high above the wine—dark sea, gliding north. Soon
the Peloponnesian coast comes into View. The only break
in the shoreline is the inlet of Laconia, and we follow it
inland.

The inlet ends in a natural harbor where several tall—
masted warships are beached, sails unfurled, oars locked
and rowing benches empty. Dozens of smaller fishing boats
are scattered about the harbor.

On top of the highest hill, overlooking all Sparta, stands
a thick—walled PALACE. Torch—bearing SENTRIES, wearing
plumed helmets and carrying long spears, man their posts.

MENELAUS (V.O.)
Princes of Troy, on our last night
together, Queen Helen and I salute
you.

INT. PALACE OF SPARTA — RECEPTION HALL — CONTINUOUS 8

MENELAUS (40), king of Sparta, stands at the head of a
massive table that spans the length of a hall lit by
torches. A battle—scarred warrior, Menelaus is already
halfway drunk.

Beside Menelaus sits his wife, HELEN (25), wearing a white
gown, head bowed, half listening to her husband. Fresh
flowers are woven into her hair. Her beauty is so extreme
she seems to exist in a separate realm.

(CONTINUED)

lO.
CONTINUED: 8

The only woman in the room and the only one wearing white,
Helen shines amidst the unwashed WARRIORS of Sparta and
Troy. All sit at a table laden with platters of roasted
game birds, whole fish, octopi, suckling pigs and bowls of
fruit.

Menelaus holds his gold wine goblet in the air, toasting
his honored guests, HECTOR (55) and PARIS (25).

Hector is not the best—looking man in the room, nor the
largest, but the intensity of his expression, the regality
of his bearing, confirms that he is a born leader.

Paris is the best—looking man in the room, by a long shot.
He's not paying attention to Menelaus. He's staring at
Helen.

MENELAUS
We've had our conflicts before,
it's true. We've fought many
battles, Sparta and Troy. And
fought well!

Menelaus's soldiers cheer drunkenly. For a moment Helen
looks up and meets Paris's gaze.

MENELAUS
But I've always respected your
father. Priam is a good man, a
good king. I respected him as an
adversary, and I respect him now as
my ally.

More cheering, this time from the entire assembly.

MENELAUS
Hector, Paris, young princes, come,
stand, drink with me.

Hector stands. Paris does not. He's still staring at

Helen. Hector nudges his brother's shoulder. Paris
stands.

MENELAUS
Let us drink to peace.

Hector nods to Menelaus and raises his cup.

HECTOR
Peace between Troy and Sparta.

(CONTINUED)

11.
CONTINUED: (2) 8

The king and the princes drink deeply and slam their empty
cups to the table.

MENELAUS
May the gods keep the wolves in the
hills and the women in our beds.

All the men in the hall cheer and rise to their feet.

GUESTS
To Sparta! To Troy!

A band of MUSICIANS strike up their instruments; SERVANTS
roam the hall filling goblets with wine.

POLYDORA (20), one of Helen's handmaidens, leads a dozen
attractive YOUNG WOMEN into the banquet hall.

The warriors howl at the sight of the women. Soon each of
the handmaidens is flanked by drunken soldiers.

Menelaus grabs Hector in a bear hug. Hector gamely
accepts the embrace. When the king releases him, both men
spill a few drops of wine from their cups onto the floor.

They drink the rest of their wine. Menelaus grips
Hector's upper arm. SERVANTS refill the cups.

MENELAUS
A strong arm. Thank the gods we
made peace —— I've seen too many of

my men struck down with this arm.

HECTOR
Never again, I hope.

MENELAUS
Only one man works a sword better
than you. The son of Peleus the
Argonaut.

HECTOR
Achilles.

MENELAUS
That madman would throw a spear at
Zeus himself if the god insulted
him.

(CONTINUED)

12.
CONTINUED: (5) 8

Menelaus indicates Polydora, who stares at Hector openly.

MENELAUS
You see that one over there? I
picked her just for you. She's a
little lioness.

Menelaus grins at the girl, who lowers her eyes and
smiles. Helen notices this silent exchange but ignores
it, conversing instead with another HANDMAIDEN who sits
beside her.

HECTOR
Thank you. My wife waits for me in
Troy.

MENELAUS

My wife waits for me right there.

He leans forward to whisper conspiratorially in Hector's
ear.

MENELAUS
Wives are for breeding. You
understand? For making little
princes. Come, enjoy yourself
tonight.

Helen stands and walks out of the reception hall.
Menelaus does not notice. Hector does. He raises his cup
to Menelaus.

HECTOR
You make excellent wine in Sparta.

Menelaus laughs and drinks with Hector.

Paris excuses himself from the Spartan generals he's been
speaking with and heads outside —— in the same direction
as Helen. Hector watches with mounting agitation.

INT. HELEN'S CHAMBER — NIGHT 9
The room is lit by a dozen tall candles. Helen removes
the flowers from her hair and drops them into a bowl of
water. She hears a sound and looks up. Paris stands in

the doorway.

For several breaths they are silent, staring at each
other.

(CONTINUED)

15.
CONTINUED: 9

HELEN
You shouldn't be here.

Paris closes the door behind him.

PARIS
That's what you said last night.

HELEN
Last night was a mistake.

PARIS
And the night before?

Helen continues removing the flowers from her hair but she
cannot hide a half—smile.

HELEN
I've made many mistakes this week.

He approaches her.

PARIS
Do you want me to go?

His hands are on her now, sliding down her bare neck, down
her back, resting on her hips. His mouth is very close to
her ear. Helen closes her eyes.

HELEN
(whispering)
Yes.

Paris kisses her neck, her ears, her closed eyes. The
tightness we saw in her face when she sat by her husband's
side is gone, replaced by ecstasy.

PARIS
(whispering)
Where should I go?

She kisses him back now and there's a hunger in her
kisses, something close to violence in her desire. She
lifts off his tunic and pulls him nearer.

HELEN
(whispering)
Away. Far away.

In a moment the white gown slips to her feet. He stares
at her naked body in wonder. He opens his mouth to speak
but she kisses him full on the lips. They sink onto the
bed.

INT. PALACE — RECEPTION HALL — NIGHT 10

As more and more wine gourds are emptied, the scene grows
rowdier. An impromptu choir of Spartan and Trojan
soldiers drunkenly sing battle songs.

Polydora sits on Menelaus's lap. She whispers in his ear
while he laughs and drains another cup of wine. Bits of
roasted boar fleck his thick red beard.

Hector sits nearby, half engaged in conversation with
several Spartan generals. He's clearly not happy that his
brother's still missing.

INT. HELEN'S CHAMBER — NIGHT (LATER) 11

Helen lies naked on her bed. In the candlelight her
flanks are mapped with copper trails of sweat. She
watches Paris, who stands bedside pulling on his clothes.

PARIS
I have something for you.

From his tunic he pulls a necklace of baby pearls threaded
with silver. He sits beside her in bed.

PARIS
Pearls from the sea of Propontis.

Paris strings the pearls around her neck.

HELEN
They're beautiful.
(beat)
But I can't wear them. Menelaus
would kill us both.

PARIS
Don't be afraid of him.

HELEN
I'm not afraid of dying. I'm
afraid of tomorrow, watching you
sail away and knowing you'll never
come back.

She runs her fingers across his jaw line.

HELEN
Before you came to Sparta I was a
ghost. I walked and I ate and I
swam in the sea, but I was a ghost.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 11

PARIS
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

Helen watches him, unsure what he means.

PARIS
Come with me.

For a long moment they stare into each other's eyes.

HELEN
Don't play with me, prince of Troy.
Don't play.

The sounds of footsteps and laughter outside the door
startle them. Paris halfway unsheathes a KNIFE hanging
from his belt.

Whoever's walking by the door passes without stopping.
Paris sheathes his knife, kneels beside the bed and takes
her hand.

PARIS
If you come we'll never be safe.
Men will hunt us and the gods will
curse us. But I'll love you.
Until the day they burn my body I
will love you.

Helen stares into Paris' eyes, contemplating the
impossible.

INT. PALACE — COURTYARD — LATER 12

A group of TROJAN SOLDIERS lies on goatskins and furs

around a bonfire built in the middle of the courtyard.
Some sleep; some continue to drink and sing old Trojan
songs.

Hector stands by the fire, conferring with TECTON (50), a
bull—necked captain of the elite Apollonian Guard.

HECTOR
Make the proper offerings to
Poseidon before we sail. We don't
need any more widows in Troy.

TECTON
Goat or pig?

HECTOR
Which does the Sea God prefer?

(CONTINUED)

16.

CONTINUED: l2

TECTON
(smiling)
I'll wake the priest and ask him.

Tecton bows and exits the courtyard. Hector sees Paris
slinking past the bonfire, sneaking toward his quarters.

HECTOR
Paris!

Paris turns, smiles and waves, acting as if he hadn't seen
Hector before. He ambles over to join his brother.

HECTOR
You should get to bed. We won't
sleep on land again for weeks.

PARIS
I have no trouble sleeping on the
seas. The sea nymphs sing
lullabies to me.

HECTOR
And who sang lullabies to you
tonight?

Paris freezes for a moment but quickly regains his poise.

PARIS
Tonight? Tonight was the
fisherman's wife. A lovely
creature.

HECTOR
I hope you didn't let the fisherman
catch you.

PARIS
He's more concerned with the fish.

Paris smiles and starts to walk away but Hector holds him.

HECTOR
You do understand why we're in
Sparta?

PARIS

For peace.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2) l2

HECTOR
And you do understand that
Menelaus, King of Sparta, is a
powerful man? And that his
brother, Agamemnon, King of
Mycenae, commands all the Greek
forces?

PARIS
What does this have to do with the
fisherman's wife?

Hector seizes Paris's face between the palms of his hand.
Not a violent gesture, exactly, but not gentle, either.

HECTOR
Paris. You're my brother, and I
love you. But if you do anything
to endanger Troy I'll rip your
pretty face from your pretty skull.
He kisses Paris on the forehead.

HECTOR
Get some sleep. We sail in the
morning.

Paris, a bit shocked by the encounter, stumbles away.

EXT. IONIAN SEA — DAY 15

The TROJAN SHIP sails over the waves.

EXT. SHIP'S DECK — DAY 14

The winds are strong. Nobody needs to row. SAILORS tend
the sails or play dice.

Hector stands in the bow, leaning against the rail,
whittling a WOODEN LION. Paris joins him.

PARIS
A beautiful morning. Poseidon has
blessed our voyage.

Hector looks at the blue sky for a moment.

HECTOR
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the
afternoon.

Paris watches his brother work the wood. When Paris
speaks again his tone is more sober than we've heard it
before.

PARIS
Do you love me, brother?

Hector rests his knife on the deck and smiles.

HECTOR
What have you done now?

PARIS
I need to show you something.

Paris walks toward the staircase leading inside the ship.
Hector watches him for a few seconds and then follows.

INT. TROJAN SHIP 15
Paris pauses in front of his cabin door.

PARIS
Before you get angry with me ——

HECTOR
Open the door.

Paris opens the door. Helen, wearing a hooded robe, sits

on the edge of a hammock, swinging slightly. She stands.

Hector stares at her in disbelief. He turns and glares at
Paris.

HECTOR
If you weren't my brother I'd kill
you where you stand.

PARIS
Hector ——

Hector is already out the door. Helen looks at Paris.

HELEN
We'll never have peace.

PARIS
I don't want peace. I want you.

He kisses her —— a desperate, hungry kiss, the two of them
against the world —— then turns and follows his brother.
INT. PALACE OF SPARTA — HELEN'S BEDCHAMBER — DAY 16

Menelaus, followed by ten SOLDIERS, storms into Helen's
room.

INT. HELEN'S BEDCHAMBER 17

He finds Polydora polishing the queen's jewelry. Menelaus
grabs her arm roughly. She's terrified.

MENELAUS
Where is she?

POLYDORA
Who, my king?

Menelaus draws his sword.

MENELAUS
I swear by the father of the gods
I'll gut you here if you don't tell
me.

The handmaiden tries to speak but no words come out.
Fortunately for her, HIPPASUS, (50), a royal advisor,
enters the room at that moment followed by an old
FISHERMAN (65).

HIPPASUS
She left with the Trojans, my king.

Menelaus stares at Hippasus, who swallows and gestures at
the fisherman. The fisherman looks as if he'd rather be
fishing.
HIPPASUS
The old man saw her board their
ship.

Menelaus releases the handmaiden and stares at the
fisherman.

MENELAUS
The Trojans?

FISHERMAN
With the young prince. Paris.
She ——

Menelaus holds up his hand. The fisherman shuts up.
Everyone watches the king, waiting for an explosion, but
the news —— strangely —— seems to focus him.

MENELAUS
Get my ship ready.

EXT. TROJAN SHIP 18

Hector walks quickly toward the stern, Paris right behind
him. The PILOT mans the rudder.

HECTOR
(to pilot)
Turn us around. Back to Sparta.

PARIS
Wait, wait.

Hector spins on his brother.

HECTOR
You fool.

PARIS
Listen to me ——

Hector shoves his brother backwards. The older brother's
physical power is obvious. SAILORS watch in awed silence.

HECTOR
Do you know what you've done? Do
you know how many years our father
worked for peace? How many
brothers and cousins he lost on the
battlefield?

PARIS
I love her.

The muscles in Hector's jaw bulge against his cheeks.

HECTOR
Say another word and I'll break
your arm. This is all a game for
you, isn't it?

HECTOR (CONT'D)
You roam from town to town, bedding
merchants' wives and temple maids —
— you think you know something
about love? What about your
father's love? You spat on him
when you brought her on this ship.
What about love of your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman.

Paris starts to speak but Hector raises a warning finger.

HECTOR
I won't let you start a war for
her.

PARIS

May I speak?

(beat)
What you say is true. I've wronged
you. I've wronged our father. If
you want to bring Helen back to
Sparta, so be it. But I go with
her.

HECTOR
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

PARIS
Then I'll die fighting.

Hector laughs bitterly. He grabs the collar of Paris's

tunic.

HECTOR
That sounds heroic to you, doesn't
it? To die fighting. Tell me,
little brother, have you ever
killed a man?

PARIS
No.

HECTOR
Have you ever even seen a man die
in combat?

PARIS
No.

Hector's face is flushed with anger. Paris tries to look
away but Hector won't let him.

HECTOR

I've killed men, brother. I've
watched them dying, I've heard them
dying, I've smelled them dying.

(beat)
There's nothing glorious about it,
nothing poetic. You think you want
to die for love, but you know
nothing about dying. You know
nothing about love.

PARIS
All the same, I go with her.

Hector releases his brother. He stares at the sea.

PARIS
I won't ask you to fight my war.

Hector shakes his head, still staring into the waves.

HECTOR
You already have.

For a long time Hector is silent. Finally he turns to the
pilot, who awaits the prince's command.

HECTOR
To Troy.

Hector walks away from his brother.

EXT. MYCENAE HARBOR — DAY 19
Three WARSHIPS are anchored in the harbor.

Menelaus, followed by Hippasus and a retinue of SOLDIERS,
climbs the long stone staircase that leads to the walled
city of Mycenae, a citadel hewn from the hilltop rock.

INT. MYCENAE CITADEL — THRONE ROOM — DAY 20
Menelaus and his followers enter the throne room.

Treasures from various conquests fill the room: statuary
and urns and intricate gold work. Armed GUARDS stand at
their posts.

CONTINUED: 20

Only Agamemnon is seated, on a beautiful throne carved
from solid oak. Two robed NOBLES are addressing him when
Menelaus enters —— they move away as the Spartans

Agamemnon stands. The two kings embrace.

AGAMEMNON
Your messenger came two days ago.
I know what happened.

Menelaus's face darkens, his rage barely submerged.

MENELAUS
I want her back.

AGAMEMNON
Of course you do. She's a
beautiful woman.

MENELAUS
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands. I won't
rest until I've burned Troy to the

ground.
AGAMEMNON
(smiling)
I thought you wanted peace with
Troy.
MENELAUS

I should have listened to you.

AGAMEMNON
Peace is for the women and the
weak. Empires are forged by war.

MENELAUS
All my life I've stood by your
side, fought your enemies. You're
the eldest, you reap the glory ——
this is the way of the world. But
have I ever complained, brother?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

AGAMEMNON
Never. You're a man of honor.
Everyone in Greece knows this.

MENELAUS
The Trojans spat on my honor. An
insult to me is an insult to you.

AGAMEMNON
And an insult to me is an insult to
all Greeks.

MENELAUS
Will you go to war with me,
brother?

Menelaus reaches out his hand. Agamemnon looks into his
eyes. Finally he nods and clasps hands with his brother.

INT. MYCENAE CITADEL — THRONE ROOM — NIGHT 21

Agamemnon paces the vast, torch—lit room. Nestor sits at
a wooden table. Spread out on the table before him is a
rough map of Greece and environs, painted on a tanned goat
skin.

AGAMEMNON
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman. But she's
proven to be very useful. Nothing
unifies a people like a common
enemy.

NESTOR
The Trojans have never been
conquered. Some say they can't be
conquered.

AGAMEMNON

I haven't tried yet.

Old King Priam thinks he's
untouchable behind his high walls.
He thinks the Sun God will protect
him. But the gods only protect the
strong.

Aegean.

NESTOR
Hector commands the finest army in
the east. And Troy is built to
withstand a ten—year siege.

Nestor stands and prepares to leave.

AGAMEMNON
Achilles can't be controlled. He's
as likely to fight us as the
Trojans.

NESTOR
We don't need to control him. We
need to unleash him. The man was
born to end lives.

AGAMEMNON

Yes, he's a gifted killer, but he
follows no king. He threatens
everything I've built.

(beat)
Before me Greece was nothing, a
province of warlords and cattle
raiders. I've brought all the
Greek kingdoms together —— with the
sword when necessary, with a treaty
when possible. I've created a
nation out of fire—worshippers and
snake—eaters.

I build the future, Nestor.
Achilles is the past, a man who
fights for no flag, a man loyal to
no country.

Nestor waits a respectful moment before replying.

NESTOR

Your words are true. But how many

This will be the greatest war the
world has ever seen. We need the
greatest warrior.

Agamemnon thinks about it, pacing the room. Finally ——

AGAMEMNON
There's only one man he'll listen
to.

NESTOR

I'll send a ship in the morning.

EXT. ITHACA — DAY 22

A lean, bearded SHEPHERD (40) sits on a hillside looking
over the Ionian sea.

Beside him sits his faithful hunting dog, ARGOS. They
watch a troop of EMISSARIES climb the steep hill. The
emissaries are panting for breath by the time they reach
the hilltop.

EMISSARY #1
Greetings, brother. We were told
King Odysseus is here in the hills.

SHEPHERD
Odysseus? That old bastard drinks
my wine and never pays.

EMISSARY #2
You ought to respect your king,
friend.

SHEPHERD
Respect him? I'd like to punch him
in the nose. He's always pawing at
my wife, trying to tear her clothes
off.

The emissaries, embarrassed, begin walking away. The
shepherd watches them go.

SHEPHERD

I hope Agamemnon's generals are
smarter than his emissaries.

Emissary #1 turns to look at the shepherd.

EMISSARY #1
What did you say?

The shepherd scratches behind Argos's ears. The dog wags
his tail happily.

SHEPHERD
You want me to help you fight the
Trojans.

EMISSARY #1
You're ——

Emissary #1 exchanges glances with his compatriots.
They're confused. Finally the chastened emissaries bow.

EMISSARY #1
Forgive us, King Odysseus.

Odysseus stands and looks down at his dog.

ODYSSEUS
Well, I'm going to miss my dog.

EMISSARY #2
King Agamemnon has a favor to ask
of you.
Odysseus smiles and rubs his dog's head.

ODYSSEUS
Of course he does.
EXT. SEASIDE CLIFF — LATE AFTERNOON 25
Achilles stands in the ruins of an ivy—covered temple on a
cliff above the sea, sparring with his cousin Patroclus

(17). Both men wield wooden practice swords.

Patroclus is a talented, lean, flashy young fighter. His
sword whirls in the air like a thing alive.

Achilles, by contrast, is the apotheosis of the efficient
combatant, wasting no energy, waiting for weakness.

(CONTINUED)

25

28.
CONTINUED: 25

Patroclus presses in on the attack. Achilles tilts his
head to avoid one thrust, side—steps to avoid another.
Spying a momentary opening he lunges forward and taps
Patroclus' belly with the tip of his wood sword.

ACHILLES
You're getting fat, cousin.

Patroclus grins and relaunches his attack, sword spinning
with blazing speed. Achilles ducks beneath an arcing
swing and sword—taps Patroclus on the back.

ACHILLES
Fancy swordplay. The girls must be
impressed.

Patroclus grunts and charges in again. This time a
genuine duel develops, featuring splendid repartee and
parrying.

PATROCLUS
A little nervous, aren't you?

ACHILLES
Terrified.

Achilles raises his right hand and Patroclus lifts his
sword to parry the blow —— but Achilles no longer holds
his sword in his right hand.

Sword in hisleft hand, Achilles taps Patroclus on the
chest. Patroclus stares down at the wood blade.

PATROCLUS
You told me never to switch sword
hands.

Achilles rolls his head to loosen his neck.

ACHILLES
By the time you know how to do it,
you won't be following my orders
anymore.

Achilles tosses aside the sparring sword. He cocks his
head as if listening to some distant sound. Patroclus,
oblivious to the noise, practices his swordplay.

Achilles' foot curls around the wood shaft of one of the
spears lying on the ground. In one impossibly fast
motion, he flips the spear into the air with his foot,
catches it, and throws in the opposite direction from
where he was looking.

29.

CONTINUED: (2) 25

The bronze warhead blazes between the temple's walls and
drives into the trunk of an old fir.

Only now do we see Odysseus, leading a black horse,
standing inches from the quivering shaft of the spear
blocking his path. He stares at the spear for a moment
before ducking his head under the shaft and walking
forward.

ODYSSEUS
(smiling)
Your reputation for hospitality is
fast becoming legend.

ACHILLES
I don't like that smile, my friend.
It's the smile you smile when you
want me to fight in another war.
(beat)
Patroclus, my cousin —— Odysseus,
king of Ithaca.

ODYSSEUS
Patroclus, son of Menoetius?

The boy nods. Odysseus grips Patroclus's shoulder.

ODYSSEUS
I knew your parents well. I miss
them.

Patroclus nods again, looking at his feet.

ODYSSEUS
Now you have this one watching over
you, eh? Learning from Achilles
himself —— every boy in Greece must

be jealous.
(to Achilles)
We need to talk.

ACHILLES
Tell me you're not here at
Agamemnon's bidding.

Odysseus hesitates. Achilles shakes his head.

ACHILLES
How many times have I done the
savage work for the King of Kings?
And when has he ever shown me the
respect I've earned?

25

CONTINUED:

ODYSSEUS
I'm not asking you to fight for
him. I'm asking you to fight for
the Greeks.

ACHILLES
Why? Are the Greeks tired of
fighting each other?

ODYSSEUS
For now.

ACHILLES
The Trojans never did anything to
me.

ODYSSEUS

They insulted Greece.

ACHILLES
They insulted one Greek, a man who
couldn't hold on to his wife. What
business is that of mine?

ODYSSEUS
Your business is war, my friend.

ACHILLES

(angry)
Is it? Am I the whore of the
battlefield? Can my sword be
bought and sold?

(beat; calmer)
I don't want to be remembered as a
tyrant's mercenary.

ODYSSEUS
Forget Agamemnon. Fight for me.
My wife will feel much better if
she knows you're by my side. I’ll
feel much better.

PATROCLUS
Is Ajax going to fight in Troy?
ODYSSEUS
Of course. You've heard of Ajax,

PATROCLUS

They say he can fell an oak tree

A thousand ships! Prince Hector,

The best of all the Trojans. Some

Greeks, too.

Patroclus, I hope you'll join us.

Achilles wraps his arm around Odysseus's shoulders and
leans closer to the Ithacan. The embrace is friendly, but
there's no mistaking the power in Achilles' grip.

ACHILLES
Play your tricks on me, if you'd
like. But leave my cousin out of
it.

ODYSSEUS
You have your sword, I have my

gods give us.

EXT. BEACH — SUNSET 24

Achilles makes his away across the sandy hillocks. He
spies a woman in the distance.

EXT. SEASHORE — SUNSET 25

Achilles finds his mother, THETIS (45), standing in the
surf. Her long black hair is streaked with gray. She
sees a shell that she likes and stoops down to pick it up.

ACHILLES
Mother.

Thetis turns and smiles at Achilles.

THETIS
I thought I'd make you another
seashell necklace.

ACHILLES
I haven't worn a seashell necklace
since I was a boy.
Thetis looks at Achilles' bare neck.

THETIS
Don't you like them anymore?

Achilles spots a good shell. He hands it to his mother.

THETIS
Oh, that's a pretty one.

She surveys the beach for more pretty shells.

ACHILLES
They want me for another war.

Thetis bends down and scoops up a silvery shell.

ACHILLES
Are you listening?

THETIS
Yes, my sweet. Another war.

ACHILLES
Patroclus wants to go.

THETIS
Patroclus has never seen war.

(CONTINUED)

55.

25 CONTINUED: 25

Thetis examines the shells in the palm of her hand.
Finally she stands and looks at her son.

THETIS
If you stay here, with me, with
your family, you'll have a long,
peaceful life. You'll marry,
you'll have children, and your
children will have children.
They'll love you, and when you're
gone they'll remember you. But
when your children are dead, and
their children after them, your
name will be lost.

Thetis reaches up to touch her son's cheek. Her eyes are
clear, her voice steady. She speaks these lines with no
hesitation, no doubt.

THETIS
If you go to Troy, no one will earn
more glory than you. Men will tell
stories of your victories for
thousands of years. The world will
remember your name.

Achilles stares at her, his eyes burning. These are words
he's wanted to hear since the day he was born. His mother
waits a moment before speaking again. The words hurt her.

THETIS
But if you go to Troy, you'll never
come home. You'll die there.

ACHILLES
And you know this, mother?

THETIS
I know it.

Achilles looks out to the sea. Thetis, tears in her eyes,
smiles bravely.

THETIS
Whenever your father came home from
war, he'd stare at the sea, just
like that.
(beat)
He never stayed for long.

In the distance Achilles sees a white sail. He fixates on
the lonely spot of white on the endless expanse of dark
water.

EXT. AEGEAN SEA — DAY 26

We soar above the greatest armada the world has ever seen.
ONE THOUSAND SHIPS sail east, crowding the sea, churning
the waves with their keels.

The white sails are painted with the signs and emblems of
the various nationalities represented in this alliance.
One ship sails slightly out of formation. Alone amongst
the entire fleet, this ship's sail is black.

EXT. ACHILLES' WARSHIP — DAY 27

Achilles stands in the prow of his boat, staring east.
Patroclus stands behind him, wearing a new SHELL NECKLACE.

EXT. TROY — DAY 28

Hector, Paris, Helen, and an entourage of SOLDIERS walk
through the gates of Troy.

The city is magnificent, a wonder of white—washed walls,
lush gardens, and towering STATUES of the gods. ZEUS,
APOLLO, APHRODITE, and POSEIDON stand eighty feet high in
the four corners of the main square.

The princes' return is a holiday for the Trojans.
Thousands of ONLOOKERS line the road, cheering. Other
well—wishers, standing on the roofs of houses, throw
flower petals.

Paris holds Helen's hand and occasionally whispers in her
ear, pointing out various sights, but Helen looks nervous.

People in the crowd, mystified by her appearance, point at
her and whisper amongst themselves.

Helen holds her head high and pretends to ignore the
murmurs and stares. Hector looks at her. She carries
herself like a queen —— but she's gripping Paris's hand
with white knuckles.

EXT. PALACE OF TROY 29
At the bottom of a long staircase leading into the palace,
four APOLLONIAN GUARDS, wearing horsehair—plumed helmets,
are mounted on beautiful WHITE HORSES.

Hector reunites with his wife, ANDROMACHE (50), pale
skinned and dark eyed. He holds her to his chest; she
closes her eyes, and they stand like that for a long time.

A NURSE standing nearby holds Hector's ten—month—old son,
SCAMANDRIUS. Now Andromache takes the baby from the
nurse. Hector stares into the boy's wondering eyes and
puts his finger in the boy's hand.

HECTOR
He has a good grip.

ANDROMACHE
He's just like his father. He even
hates peas.

While this reunion is going on, Paris embraces his father,
PRIAM (70), king of Troy. Priam is a regal—looking man
with a shock of white hair and sharp blue eyes. He adores
Paris.

PARIS
Father, this —— is Helen.

Helen bows her head, paying respect.

PRIAM
Helen? Helen of Sparta?

Both Helen and Priam now look at Paris.

PARIS
Helen of Troy.

If Priam is disturbed by this revelation, his face doesn't
betray it. He leans forward and kisses the former queen
on both cheeks. Helen didn't know what to expect —— she's
flustered and gratified at the same time.

PRIAM
I've heard rumors of your beauty.
For once, the gossips were right.
Welcome.

HELEN
Thank you, good king.

PRIAM
Come, you must be tired.

He leads them up the stairs and into the palace.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL (PALACE OF TROY) 29A

BRISEIS, a seventeen—year—old girl with an aristocratic
demeanor, wearing the white robes of a temple acolyte,
approaches the royal family. Paris smiles when he sees
her.
PARIS
Briseis! Beloved cousin, your
beauty grows with each new moon.

Briseis, cheeks flushing, dips her knees in deference.
Hector approaches her now, arms open. Briseis's face
lights up. She hugs the eldest prince. Hector kisses the
top of her head.

HECTOR
Did you miss me, little swan?

Briseis nods. Hector pinches the sleeve of her robe.

HECTOR
A servant of Apollo now?

PRIAM
The young men of Troy were
devastated when she chose the
virgin robes.

Briseis' cheeks turn bright red.

BRISEIS
Uncle.

Priam laughs and kisses the girl's forehead. He takes
three goblets of wine from a SERVANT holding a silver
platter and hands them to Hector and Paris, keeping one
for himself.
PRIAM

I thank the gods for your safe

return.
The king and the princes spill a few drops of wine.

PRIAM, HECTOR AND PARIS
For the gods!

They drain their goblets.

At the far end of the hall, Priam stands by an open
archway looking over the city. Hector sits at a table
that could seat fifty men.

PRIAM
It's the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.
(beat)
But I'm surprised you let him bring
her.

HECTOR
If I'd let him fight Menelaus for
her, you'd be burning a son's body
instead of welcoming a daughter.

Priam closes his eyes at these words.

PRIAM
We could send peace envoys to
Menelaus.

HECTOR

You know Menelaus. He'd spear your
envoys' heads to his gate.

PRIAM

What would you have me do?
HECTOR

Put her on a ship and send her

home.
Priam thinks for a moment, staring out at his city.

PRIAM
Women have always loved Paris and
he's loved them back.
(beat)
But this is different. Something
has changed in him. If we send her
back to Menelaus, he'll follow.

Hector stands and joins his father in the archway. He
gestures outside. The city of Troy teems with life, the
CITIZENS going about their business.

HECTOR
This is my country. These are my
countrymen. I don't want to see
them suffer so my brother can have
his prize.

PRIAM
Enemies have been attacking us for
centuries. Our walls still stand.

HECTOR
Father.

We can't win this war.

PRIAM
Apollo watches over us. Even
Agamemnon is no match for the gods.

HECTOR
How many battalions does the Sun
God command?

PRIAM
Don't mock the gods.

Hector opens his mouth to argue but holds his tongue.

PRIAM
When you were very young you came
down with scarlet fever.

Hector nods impatiently. He's heard this story before.

PRIAM

Your little hands were so hot. The
healer said you wouldn't last the
night. I went down to Apollo's
temple and I prayed until the sun
came up.

(beat)
That walk back to the palace was
the longest of my life. But I went

wars before letting him die.

Hector looks past the city to the sea. The waters are
empty now, but he knows what's coming.

HECTOR
Forgive me, father. But you won't
be the one fighting.

He bows and leaves the old king alone in the great hall.

INT. PARIS'S BEDCHAMBER — NIGHT 52

Paris paces about the room. Helen stands in the archway
looking out to the dark sea. The wind blows through her
hair.

HELEN
They're coming for me.

The wind is bringing them closer.

Paris stops pacing and stares at her.

PARIS
What if we left? Tonight, right
now, what if we went down to the
stables, took two horses and left.
Ride east, keep riding ——

Away from here. I could hunt deer,
rabbit. I could feed us.

Sparta was never my home. My

PARIS
We'll live off the land. No more
palaces for us, no more servants.
We don't need any of that.

HELEN
And your family?

PARIS
We'd be protecting my family! If
we're not here there's no need for
a war.

HELEN
Menelaus won't give up. He'll
track us to the end of the world.

PARIS
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

Helen stands and kisses him on the lips.

HELEN
You don't know Menelaus. You don't
know his brother. They'll burn
every house in Troy to find us.
They'll never believe we've left ——
and even if they do, they'll burn
Troy for spite.

Paris considers her words and finally nods.

PARIS
Then I'll make it easy for him to
find me. I'll walk right up to him

IN THE MAIN SQUARE 55A
dozens of SUPPLICANTS kneel before the statue of Poseidon
and lay down their offerings: bundles of flowers; small
carvings; goatskins filled with wine.

SOLDIERS 55B
prepare a series of fortifications at the beach. Men
carrying torches ignite giant pumice urns filled with
burning pitch. Others hammer long spikes deep into the

sand to hinder enemies rushing up from the beach.

There is little conversation and the men look tense.
Everything is touched with an air of extreme urgency.

A TEMPLE OF APOLLO 55C

overlooks the beach.

INSIDE THE TEMPLE 55D
two PRIESTS carve strips of fat from a roasted PIG and lay
them on the god's altar, muttering chants as they perform
the ritual.

Briseis, the temple acolyte, stands beside the priests,

Two SENTRIES stand in a guard tower on a corner of Troy's
city walls, sipping hot broth from bowls. A large flag,
emblazoned with Troy's HORSE EMBLEM, flies above the

tower.

Sentry #1 blows steam off his soup. He raises his eyes,
blinks and squints into the distance. He bolts upright.

Sentry #2 stands and follows his partner's gaze out to the
sea. Both of them stand slack—jawed.
A THOUSAND GREEK WARSHIPS 54A

clog the horizon, sailing straight for Troy.

SENTRY #2 54B

Priam kneels before a grand statue of Zeus in the great

thunderbolts clutched in his stone hands, stares down at

Listening to the bells, Priam takes a deep breath and Looks up

EUDORUS
Should we wait for the others?

Achilles marks the progress of the other ships. The
nearest is a quarter—mile back.

Those MYRMIDONS (Achilles' countrymen and comrades) not

ACHILLES
They brought us here for a war,

EUDORUS
Yes, my lord. But Agamemnon ——

Achilles stares at his officer until the man bows his

ACHILLES
Then fight for me. And let the

servants of Agamemnon fight for

EXT. AGAMEMNON'S WARSHIP 41

Agamemnon, Nestor and Menelaus stand in the ship's prow.

MENELAUS
Whose ship is that?

Nestor shields his eyes from the sun and looks.

Nestor
Black sail. Achilles.

They watch Achilles' ship approach the beach.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH FORTIFICATIONS — DAY
The TROJAN ARCHERS check their catgut strings one last
time.
EXT. TROJAN ARMORY — DAY
Tecton dismounts at the door of the armory and runs

inside.

INT. TROJAN ARMORY — DAY

The cavernous building is crowded with armaments: racks

and racks of spears, swords, breastplates, and shields.

Hector watches as hundreds of male CITIZENS rush into the

armory and are issued weapons by TROJAN SOLDIERS. The
faces of the men reflect fear, excitement, and resolve.

Tecton approaches the prince and bows.

HECTOR
The Apollonian Guard?

TECTON
Waiting at the city gates.

HECTOR
Good.

Hector grabs the captain, LYSANDER, overseeing arms
distribution.

HECTOR
How long before the army is ready?

LSYANDER
Half our men are still coming in
from the countryside. We have to
arm them, we have to match them
with the right officers ——

HECTOR
How long?

LSYANDER

Noon?

HECTOR
Make it sooner.

We've never seen the prince in martial mode before. He
looks different: eyes harder, mouth set and unsmiling.

HECTOR
I want patrols to scour the
countryside. Check every home,
every pasture. I want every Trojan
brought inside the walls. If they
can't walk, carry them.

Lysander bows his head. Hector walks swiftly away,
followed by Tecton. Lysander and the other Trojans watch
their prince with silent respect. There is no doubt who
leads the city.

EXT. ACHILLES' WARSHIP 45
Though the oarsmen continue to pull, everyone is now
armored. Achilles sees Patroclus, armed and ready to

fight.

ACHILLES
Where are you going?

PATROCLUS
To fight the Trojans.

Achilles shakes his head and takes Patroclus' spear.

ACHILLES
You're not ready.
PATROCLUS
I am ready. You taught me how to

fight.
Achilles rests his hand on the back of the boy's head.
ACHILLES
And you're a good student. But
you're not a Myrmidon yet.

He gestures to the Myrmidons around them.

I can't fight the Trojans if I'm
worrying about you, cousin. Guard
the ship.

Patroclus looks about the deck. The only unarmored man
aboard is an old, ONE—LEGGED COOK, mending spears.
Patroclus angrily strips off his breastplate and drops it
to the deck.

EXT. GATES OF TROY — DAY 46

Hector and Tecton gallop through the gate. They rein in
their horses and look over the elite Apollonian Guard,
eighty of Troy's finest soldiers, riding well—groomed,
snorting mounts.

When Hector speaks his voice is clear and steady.
HECTOR

All my life I've lived by a code,
and the code is simple.

(beat)
Honor the gods.

(beat)
Love your woman.

(beat)

And defend your country.
The men roar.

HECTOR
Troy is mother to us all. Fight
for her!

The men roar and thrust their spears into the air. Hector
leads the charge to the beach.

EXT. ACHILLES' WARSHIP — DAY 47

Achilles stands in his ship's bow, scanning the Trojan
dunes. He turns to face his men. He smiles.

ACHILLES
Myrmidons, we are brothers of the
sword. I'd rather fight alongside
you than any army of thousands.

Troy.

ACHILLES
Do you know what's waiting beyond
that beach?
(beat)
Immortality.

The Myrmidons raise their swords and cry out with one
voice.

The oarsmen give one last mighty pull on their oars and
beach the tar—caulked keel of the warship on Trojan sand.

Achilles puts on his helmet, grabs a coiled rope anchored
to a bronze cleat, and rappels down to the beach. The
Myrmidons follow him, tossing the ropes off the deck and
shimmying down to the beach.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH FORTIFICATIONS — CONTINUOUS 48

The archers behind the fortifications watch the Myrmidons
climb down from their ship.

Their CAPTAIN raises his hand: wait... wait...

CAPTAIN of archers
Now!

The archers rise and release their arrows.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — CONTINUOUS 49

Hundreds of arrows whistle through the air. Four of the
Myrmidons climbing down cry out as arrows hit them; they
tumble into the sea. Other arrows rip into the packed
sand or zip harmlessly into the water.

The Myrmidons, clustered together and holding their
shields above their heads, look to Achilles. Achilles
makes a hand signal. Half his men split off and run to
the fortifications on their left, howling like wolves as
arrows rain down.

EXT. ACHILLES' WARSHIP — CONTINUOUS 5O
Patroclus huddles under the railing beside the cook as
arrow after arrow screams by. A flaming arrow hits one of

the sails, and then another. The sails begin to burn.

The cook limps over to the sails, ignoring the arrows that
rain around him. Patroclus takes a deep breath and runs
in a crouch to the cook. Together they lower the burning
sails.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — DAY 51

Achilles sprints toward the archers, half his men behind
him. The archers let off another volley. More Myrmidons
fall.

EXT. AGAMEMNON'S SHIP — DAY 52

Agamemnon, Menelaus, and Nestor watch the battle from the
prow of their ship. They're still half a mile away.

AGAMEMNON
(in awe despite himself)
The man wants to die.

We hear SHOUTS of "Achilles!" from the other ships, a
great clamor as men bash the flats of their swords against
their shields and cheer their hero on.

Agamemnon hears the cheering. He grits his teeth and
glares at the distant Achilles. Nestor notices
Agamemnon's barely concealed fury. He speaks quietly, so
no one else can hear.

NESTOR
Give him his battle. You'll take
the war.

AGAMEMNON

Give him too many battles and the
men will forget who's king.

EXT. TROJAN PLAIN — DAY 55
Hector and his men near the high dunes, galloping at
breakneck speed.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — CONTINUOUS 54
Achilles, three arrows in his shield, sprints across the
sands. Arrows tear through the air about him. No man

He leaps over the fortification, sword flashing before his
feet ever touch the ground. The archers crumple to the
ground as Achilles' sword cuts through them.

In a moment the Myrmidons catch up to Achilles and lay
into the archers. Within seconds they massacre them.
Achilles turns and nods to the temple: the next target.
Eudorus gasps for air. Achilles regards him with
amusement.

ACHILLES
Breathe, my friend.

Eudorus takes two deep breaths. Achilles dashes for the
temple. His Myrmidons follow behind.

EXT. TEMPLE OF GOLD 54A

The archers at the temple unleash a fusillade of arrows.
Every few yards another Myrmidon falls. Several of them
are wounded, but if they're not dead they keep moving
forward.

EXT. AJAX'S SHIP — CONTINUOUS 55
Ajax's ship is one hundred yards from shore. Legendary
AJAX (50) —— a huge man, brutally muscled, head shaved,
face and body scarred —— stands in the prow, watching
Achilles.

AJAX

Look at him, hogging all the glory.

He walks over to his rowers, grabs an oarsmen on the front
bench under the armpits and tosses him away. Ajax sits,
grabs the oar handle, and begins rowing maniacally, the
veins in his massive arms bulging through the skin.

AJAX
Row, you lazy whores, row! Greeks
are dying!

The oarsmen redouble their efforts and the ship leaps over
the waves toward the shore.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH DUNES — DAY 56
Hector and the Apollonian Guards rein in their horses atop

the dunes. Hector sees Ajax's ship plowing into the
beach. Hundreds of other ships are close behind.

EXT. BEACH DEFENCES 56A

The Trojan archers rain arrows down on Ajax's ship.
Several flaming arrows catch in the hull and begin to

EXT. TROJAN BEACH DUNES — DAY 56B

TECTON
We can't hold the beach, my prince.

Hector sees where Achilles and the Myrmidons are heading.

HECTOR
They're trying to take the temple.

TECTON
No believer would spill blood in
Apollo's temple.

Hector, increasingly uneasy, watches Achilles dodge
arrows. He turns and points to the spot where Ajax's ship
has landed.

HECTOR
(to an Apollonian officer)
The archers need help. Burn as
many ships as you can, but don't
sacrifice yourself. Bring the men
back to the city.

The OFFICER bows and leads 6O Guards to the
fortifications.

HECTOR
(to Tecton)
Follow me.

He gallops toward the temple, Tecton and his men behind
him.

EXT. TEMPLE OF APOLLO — DAY 57
Achilles, his shield now quilled with arrows, hurls his
spear. It catches the closest archer just above the

breastplate, tearing through the man's throat.

The archers near by throw down their bows and take up the
spears racked behind them.

But Achilles is already upon them, cutting them down with
ruthless precision. Every time his bronze sword flashes
through the air another Trojan falls, and Achilles keeps
sweeping through them, his face painted with Trojan blood.

The other Myrmidons are fighting beside their leader now,
and the Trojan archers are no match for the Myrmidons in
hand to hand combat. Soon the temple area belongs to the
Greeks.

EXT. AJAX'S SHIP — CONTINUOUS 58

Ajax and his men rappel down the ship's hull while arrows
rip into wood and flesh.

Ajax carries a giant battle—axe and a shield twice the
size of most men's.

When he reaches the surf he doesn't wait for his men; he
roars and charges at the archers in the dunes.

EXT. TEMPLE OF APOLLO — CONTINUOUS 59

Achilles, not even breathing hard after the slaughter,
removes his helmet and rests it on the wall. The
surviving Myrmidons search the grounds, dispatching any
dying Trojans.

Eudorus hurries over to Achilles' side.

EUDORUS
The temple is secure.

ACHILLES
The Sun God is the patron of Troy,
our enemy. Take whatever treasure
you can find.

The Myrmidons cheer and rush the temple.

EUDORUS
With your permission, my lord ——

ACHILLES
Speak.

Eudorus gestures to the sun above them.
EUDORUS
Apollo sees everything. Perhaps

it's not wise to offend him.

Achilles nods and walks over to the towering statue of
Apollo in front of the temple.

Eudorus watches in horror as Achilles climbs atop the
statue and beheads Apollo with a swing of his sword.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — CONTINUOUS 6O
Hector and Tecton rein in their horses.

TECTON
He dares attack Apollo?

Hector spurs his horse and races toward the invaders,
followed by his twenty men.

The other sixty Apollonians gallop to Ajax's landing spot.

EXT. TEMPLE OF APOLLO — CONTINUOUS 61

Achilles gazes at the sky as if waiting for the sun to
blast him for blasphemy. Nothing happens.

Hearing hoofbeats, Achilles turns and spots Hector and his
men, two hundred yards away.

ACHILLES
(to Eudorus)
Get inside the temple, warn the
men.

Eudorus hurries to warn his comrades.

ACHILLES
Eudorus! Wait, wait a moment.

The Myrmidon captain stops. Achilles hefts a spear,
judges the distance, and throws.

One hundred yards from Achilles, the spearhead finds its
mark: Tecton's breastplate. Tecton is knocked from his
horse and skewered to the ground. He clutches at the
wooden shaft, not comprehending his fate.

Hector reins in his horse and stares at his fallen
captain. The man is finished. Hector turns to look at
Achilles.

Eudorus's eyes are wide. No other man alive could have
thrown a spear that far or that accurately.

ACHILLES
Now you can go.

Eudorus runs inside the temple.

Hector kicks his horse and gallops toward Achilles. His
men cry out and follow him. Achilles waits. Hector
raises his own spear. When he is fifty yards away, he
throws.

At the very last moment, Achilles bends his head to one
side, an almost lackadaisical movement. The spear rips
through the air occupied by Achilles' head half a moment
before.

Achilles smiles.

Hector draws his sword and charges, his men right behind
him. Achilles walks, with insulting insouciance, into the
temple.

A series of high steps lead inside the temple. Hector and
the Trojans dismount and proceed cautiously to the temple.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — DAY 62

An arrow sticks out of Ajax's leg but he doesn't seem to
notice it. He bulls forward, giant shield held in front,
and slams into the Trojan ranks.

Where Achilles is all grace and speed, Ajax is brute
force. Parrying his blows is useless: his battle axe
splits bronze shields, bronze swords, bronze helmets.

The sound of his axe carving through a breastplate and the
man beneath the breastplate is like nothing else on earth.

As Ajax drops another Trojan, he lifts his ax to the
heavens.

AJAX
I am Ajax, breaker of stones,
widow—maker of Salamis! Look upon
me, Trojans, and despair!

The Apollonians join the fight against the Greeks. The
Guards are far better than the archers at hand—to—hand
combat.

INT. TEMPLE OF APOLLO — DAY 65

Hector and his men enter the temple. Eyes adjusting to
the gloomy light, they gingerly advance. All is quiet.
Evidence of looting is everywhere.

At the back of the temple, stairs lead up to the altar
room. Hector walks toward the stairs. Blood trickles
down the steps. Hector raises his eyes.

Achilles stands atop the staircase, both hands wrapped
around the hilt of his sword, the sword point resting on
the top step. He stares down at Hector.

WAR CRIES explode through the temple. The Myrmidons burst
from their hiding places and rush the Trojans.

Hector is an obvious target. Two Myrmidons charge him,
their spears leveled.

If Achilles is the apotheosis of martial grace, Hector is
something altogether different —— a man of ordinary gifts
who has become an extraordinary warrior by dint of
experience, endless training, and powerful intelligence.

As the Myrmidons charge he waits. At the last moment he
swings his sword, slicing both spearheads from their
shafts. The Myrmidons stare at their decapitated spears.

Hector doesn't give them a chance to recover. He pounces,
sword flashing, and both men fall to the temple floor.

Achilles watches from the top step. Hector begins running
up the stairs. Achilles disappears inside the altar room.

Another Myrmidon bounds up the stairs after Hector. The
prince wheels about and kicks the Myrmidon in the
breastplate. The soldier tumbles down the steps. Hector
continues up the stairs.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — DAY 64

As more Greek ships make landfall, the Apollonian officer
sees that their position is no longer defensible.

APOLLONIAN OFFICER
Back to the city! Back to the
city!

The Trojans begin to retreat. The archers still turn to
fire whenever there's time. Mounted Guards haul fleeing
archers onto their horses.

65

56.
INT. ALTAR ROOM — DAY 65

Hector finds the bodies of two PRIESTS. They lie on the
stone floor, limbs splayed, throats slit.

Sitting atop the altar, half—hidden by the shadows, is
Achilles. He's a terrible sight to behold, splattered
with blood, his bronze sword still dripping.

ACHILLES
You must be very brave or very
stupid, to come after me alone.
(beat)
You must be Hector.

Hector stares at Achilles a moment before kneeling by the
dead priests' bodies.

ACHILLES
A private audience with the prince
of Troy. I'm flattered. Do you
know who I am?

HECTOR
These priests weren't armed.

Hector closes the eyes of the murdered priests. Achilles
jumps down from the altar and looks at the bodies.

ACHILLES
I didn't kill them. Cutting old
men's throats —— there's no honor
in that.
HECTOR
Honor?
(spits)

Children and fools fight for honor.
I fight for my country.

Hector charges. Achilles dances back, staying just out of
reach. Achilles looks relaxed, almost playful.

HECTOR
Fight me.

ACHILLES
Why kill you, prince of Troy, with
no one here to see you fall?

Achilles backs out of an archway opening onto the bright
day outside. Hector follows.

66

57.
EXT. TEMPLE OF APOLLO — CONTINUOUS 66

Down at the beach, scores of Greek ships are on the sand.

HECTOR
Why did you come here?

Achilles gestures at the invading flotilla.

ACHILLES
They'll be talking about this war
for a thousand years.

HECTOR
In a thousand years even the dust
from our bones will be gone.

ACHILLES
Yes, prince. But our names will
remain.

A band of bloodied Myrmidons, led by Eudorus, emerges from
the temple. Hector, surrounded by enemies, warily backs
off.

EUDORUS
(to Achilles)
The Trojans are dead.

ACHILLES
Go home, prince. Drink some wine.
Make love to your wife. Tomorrow
we'll have our war.

HECTOR
You speak of war as if it's a game.
But how many wives wait at Troy's
gate for husbands they'll never see
again?

ACHILLES
Perhaps your brother can comfort
them. I hear he's good at charming
other men's wives.

Hector stares at Achilles and the Myrmidons for another
moment before walking away.

EUDORUS
Why did you let him go?

ACHILLES
It's too early in the day for
killing princes.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — DAY 67

Thousands of Greek soldiers on the beach watch as the
Trojans retreat, many of the archers riding behind their
Apollonian saviors.

Hector mounts his horse and rides back toward the city.

When the Greeks see Achilles climbing onto the temple's
roof they stare in awe, silent.

Achilles raises his bloodied bronze sword toward the sun.

The CLAMOR that erupts from the beach is deafening.
Thousands of men cheering and yelling his name: Achilles!
Achilles!

EXT. AGAMEMNON'S SHIP — DAY 68

Agamemnon, still aboard his ship, waits for the gangplank
to be lowered. His dark eyes are cold and hateful as he
listens to the men cheering.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — LATER 69

Soldiers tug more and more ships onto the sand. From the
landed ships, primitive cranes are already beginning to
lower boxes of provisions, military materiel, and horses.

Achilles walks across the beach, carrying his helmet,
accepting the congratulations of the troops. Ajax,
shirtless, strides over.

AJAX
Achilles!

Achilles halts. For a moment there seems to be tension in
the air. Everyone watches. Ajax gives Achilles a bear
hug.

AJAX
You're as fearless as a god.

ACHILLES
The gods are immortal. What do
they have to fear?

Ajax laughs and releases Achilles.

AJAX
I'm honored to go to war with you.

Achilles nods and grips the big man's thick arm.

ACHILLES
I don't have to worry about my back
with you behind me.

Achilles continues walking. He sees Odysseus walking down
a gangplank from his ship to the beach.

ACHILLES
(calling out)
If you sailed any slower, the war
would be over.

ODYSSEUS
I don't mind missing the beginning
of the war —— as long as I'm here

at the end.

Achilles smiles and keeps walking. He arrives at the
Myrmidon's newly established base. Patroclus, Eudorus,
and the other surviving Myrmidons greet Achilles.

EUDORUS
We have something to show you.

Achilles follows Eudorus and the grinning Myrmidons to a
large tent twenty yards inland from their beached ship. A
few Myrmidons hammer the last tent pegs deep into the
sand.

Eudorus holds open the tent flap. Achilles looks at his
captain for a moment before entering the tent.

70 INT. ACHILLES' TENT — CONTINUOUS 70

No rugs have been laid down yet, so loot from the temple
has been stacked on the sand: gold chalices, black

amphorae, woven tapestries, goatskins filled with sacred
wine.

But Achilles does not look at this plunder. Bound by the
wrists to the center pole of the tent is Briseis, dressed
in her white robes.

Terrified but trying to retain her composure, she returns
Achilles' stare. Robes torn, hair disheveled, bleeding
from the lip: she still possesses her innate dignity and
strength. Something changes in Achilles' eyes when he
looks at her.

EUDORUS
The men found her hiding in the
temple. They thought she'd...

Eudorus bows and exits.

Achilles pulls a small, sharp knife from his belt.
Briseis stares at the blade.

Achilles walks over to her and cuts the ropes that bind
her. She sits back, rubbing the chafed skin of her
wrists, still watching Achilles. He sheathes his knife.

ACHILLES
What's your name?

Briseis stares at him but doesn't answer. Achilles
becomes aware, for the first time, that he's covered in
blood. He wipes a hand across his face. Briseis looks
about the tent, as if searching for a way out.

ACHILLES
You're safer in this tent than out
there. Believe me.

BRISEIS
You killed Apollo's priests.

ACHILLES
I've killed men in five countries.
But never a priest.

BRISEIS
Then your men did.
(beat)
The Sun God will have his

vengeance.
Achilles removes his bronze grieves.

ACHILLES
What's he waiting for?

Briseis is stunned by such blunt blasphemy but she can't
take her eyes off him, because Achilles, after all, is
Achilles.

BRISEIS
The right time to strike.

Achilles removes his breastplate.

ACHILLES
His priests are dead and his
acolyte's a captive.

I think your god is afraid of me.

Briseis laughs bitterly.

BRISEIS
Afraid? Apollo is master of the
sun. He fears nothing.

Achilles nods and looks around the dark tent.

ACHILLES
Then where is he?

Briseis has no answer. Achilles smiles and she looks
away.

A bucket of hot water sits beside a washcloth. Achilles
wets the cloth and begins to scrub the blood from his
body.

BRISEIS
You're nothing but a killer. You
don't know anything about the gods.

ACHILLES
You haven't seen twenty summers and
you think you know my heart? I
know more about the gods than
priests could ever teach you.
(beat)
You're royalty, aren't you?

Briseis says nothing. Achilles smiles again.

ACHILLES
You've spent years talking down to
men, you must be royalty. What's
your name?

(beat)
Even the servants of Apollo have
names.
BRISEIS
Briseis.

ACHILLES
Are you afraid, Briseis?

Briseis is quiet for a moment. She watches Achilles with
a mixture of fear and curiosity.

BRISEIS
Should I be?

EUDORUS (O.S.)

(calling from outside
the tent)
My lord ——

ACHILLES
What is it?

Eudorus sticks his head inside the tent.

EUDORUS
King Agamemnon requests your
presence.
ACHILLES

Why would I want to look at him
when I can look at her?

EUDORUS
All the kings are there,
celebrating the victory.

Achilles stands.

ACHILLES
Give me a moment.

Eudorus withdraws. A long beat while Achilles studies

her.
ACHILLES
You don't need to fear me, girl.
You're the only Trojan who can say
that.
71 EXT. AGAMEMNON'S TENT — LATER

Two muscular GUARDS stand by the opening to Agamemnon's
tent. Achilles, wearing clean clothes, doesn't bother

waiting for the guards' permission to enter; he brushes
past them and through the tent flap.

72

65.
INT. AGAMEMNON'S TENT — CONTINUOUS 72

The largest tent on the beach, Agamemnon's command
quarters are a lush affair, decorated with the spoils of a
dozen wars. Several AIDES—DE—CAMP bustle in and out on
various errands. The Greek kings are here: Odysseus,
Ajax, Menelaus, etc.

Agamemnon sits on a heavy wood throne, garishly inlaid
with gold, mother—of—pearl, and precious stones.

Triopas, king of Thessaly, kneels before Agamemnon.

TRIOPAS
You've won a great victory, King of
Kings. No one thought the Trojan
beach could be captured so easily.

He hands Agamemnon a ceremonial dagger with a gold hilt.

AGAMEMNON
A beautiful gift, Triopas. You
will be among the first to walk the
streets of Troy tomorrow.

Triopas stands and bows. Achilles has watched this
exchange with disbelief. He glances at Odysseus, who
shrugs. Now Nestor, king of the Pylians, kneels before
Agamemnon and hands him an urn decorated with painted
warriors.

NESTOR
My father Neleus had this urn made
to commemorate his victory at
Cyparisseis. I present it to you
in honor of an even more memorable
victory.

AGAMEMNON
Thank you, old friend. Tomorrow
we'll eat supper in the gardens of
Troy.

Nestor stands and bows. Agamemnon places the dagger and
urn beside a pile of other luxurious gifts. As the kings
file out of the tent, Odysseus clasps Achilles' shoulder
and speaks to him out of the others' earshot.

ODYSSEUS
War is young men dying and old men
talking. You know this. Ignore
the politics.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 72

Odysseus exits the tent. Agamemnon deigns to notice
Achilles waiting for him.

AGAMEMNON
(to his aides)
Leave us.

The aides exit, leaving Achilles and Agamemnon alone.
Achilles eyes the pile of gifts.

ACHILLES
Apparently you've won some great
victory.

AGAMEMNON

Ah, perhaps you didn't notice. The
Trojan beach belonged to Priam in
the morning. It belongs to
Agamemnon in the afternoon.

ACHILLES
You can have the beach. I didn't
come here for sand.

AGAMEMNON

No, you came because you want your
name to last through the ages.

(beat)
A great victory was won today ——
but the victory is not yours.
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.
Kings did not bring homage to
Achilles.

ACHILLES
The battle was won by soldiers.
The soldiers know who fought.

AGAMEMNON

History remembers the kings, not
the soldiers.

(beat)
Tomorrow we'll batter down the
gates of Troy. I'll build
monuments to victory on every
island of Greece, and carve
Agamemnon in the stone. My name
will last forever. Your name is
written in the sand, for the waves
to wash away.

ACHILLES
First you need the victory.

65.

CONTINUED: (2) 72
Achilles turns to leave.

AGAMEMNON
One more thing, son of Peleus.

Achilles stops.

ACHILLES
I don't want to hear my father's
name from your mouth.

AGAMEMNON
The first pick of the battle's
spoils always goes to the
commander. Your men sacked the
temple of Apollo, yes?

ACHILLES
You want gold? Take it, it's my
gift, to honor your courage. Take
what you want.

AGAMEMNON
I already have. Aphareus! Haemon!

Two battle—scarred soldiers, APHAREUS and HAEMON, drag
Briseis into the tent. Her face is bruised —— clearly
she's been slapped around.

AGAMEMNON
The spoils of war. Tonight I'll
have her give me a bath. And then
—— who knows?

Achilles draws his sword.

ACHILLES
(to the soldiers)
I have no quarrel with you,
brothers. But you'll never see
home again if you don't let her go.

The soldiers hesitate, then draw their own swords.
Achilles advances on them.

AGAMEMNON

BRISEIS
Stop!

Everyone stops and looks at the girl. Despite her torn
robes, her noble bearing and authoritative tone command
respect.

BRISEIS
Too many people have died today.

She looks at the various men in the room and finally
addresses Achilles.

BRISEIS
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse. But I don't
want anyone dying for me.

Everyone is quiet until Agamemnon laughs.

AGAMEMNON
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a
slave girl.

ACHILLES
She's not a slave.

AGAMEMNON
She is now.

Achilles' eyes are flat and merciless.

ACHILLES
Before my time is done, King of
Kings, I will look down on your
corpse and smile.

Achilles turns and leaves the tent.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — DAY 75

Most of the ships have been hauled onto the beach.
Hundreds of soldiers finish digging a long trench in the
sand. Pikes are anchored and other fortifications
constructed to protect the tents and ships from attack.

EXT. CITY OF TROY — DUSK 74

In the dying light, the Trojans prepare their city for
siege. Gray—bearded OFFICERS oversee the reinforcement of
the main gates. SOLDIERS haul thousands of arrows atop
the city walls.

EXT. TEMPLE OF ZEUS 74A

A massive CONGREGATION at the Temple of Zeus kneels before
the Thunder God's statue while PRIESTS burn the BODIES of
fallen Trojan soldiers on tall PYRES. The WIDOWS keen.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — NIGHT 75

The beach is lit by thousands of torches. The Greeks have
transformed the serene beach into a well—fortified camp.

INT. PRIAM'S MEETING HALL — NIGHT 76

Priam stands by the room's open archway. Beyond the city
he sees his beach occupied by the tremendous Greek force.

Hector, Paris, and several of Troy's leading GENERALS,
ARISTOCRATS and PRIESTS sit around the long table. One of
the generals, GLAUCUS (60), pounds the table with his
fist.

GLAUCUS
If they want a war, we'll give them
a war. I'd match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

VELIOR (40), a big—bellied nobleman, shakes his head.

VELIOR
The best of Greece outnumber the
best of Troy, two to one.

GLAUCUS
So what do you suggest, we
surrender the city, let the Greeks
slaughter our men and rape our
wives?

Velior looks at Paris until the prince returns his gaze.

VELIOR
I suggest diplomacy. The Greeks
came here for one thing. Let's be
honest, my friends. Trojans are
burning on the pyre right now
because of one youthful
indiscretion.

Paris looks away from Velior.

PRIAM
Glaucus, you've fought with me for
forty years. Can we win this war?

GLAUCUS
Our walls have never been breached.
Our archers are the best in the
world. And we have Hector. His
men would fight the shades of
Tartarus if he commanded. We can
w1n.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS (65), High Priest of Troy, wearing a long
white robe embroidered with gold thread, now raises his

voice.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
I spoke with two farmers today.
They saw an eagle flying with a
serpent clutched in its talons.
(beat)
This is a sign from Apollo. We
will win a great victory tomorrow.
Troy is the eagle. The Greeks ——

HECTOR
Bird signs! You want to plan our
strategy based on bird signs?

PRIAM
Hector. Show respect. When
Archeptolemus prophesied four years
of drought, we dug deeper wells.
The drought came and we had water
to drink. The high priest is a
servant of the gods.

HECTOR

And I'm a servant of Troy.

(beat)
I've always honored the gods,
father. You know that. But today
I fought with a Greek who
desecrated the statue of Apollo.
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

The gods won't fight this war for
us.

PARIS
There won't be a war.

This is not a conflict of nations.
It's a dispute between two men.
And I don't want to see another
Trojan die because of me.

PRIAM
Paris ——

PARIS
Tomorrow morning I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.
The winner will take her home. The
loser will burn before nightfall.

Paris leaves the room. The others sit in stunned silence.

GLAUCUS
Does he have a chance?

Everyone looks at Hector, who meditates before answering.

HECTOR
I want our army outside the gate in
the morning. Agamemnon won't let
this war end with a duel.

EXT. PALACE GARDEN — NIGHT 77

Priam's gardens are wondrous: palm trees grow in the
courtyard; flowered vines climb the walls; Aeolian harps
chime in the breeze.

Priam and Paris sitting on a bench, facing a statue of
Aphrodite. The king holds a cloth—wrapped bundle in his
lap.

PARIS
Father, I... I'm sorry for the pain
I've caused you. I ——

PRIAM
Do you love her?

Paris looks up at the statue of Aphrodite.

PARIS

You're a great king because you
love your country so much. Every
blade of grass, every grain of
sand, every rock in the river ——
you love all of Troy.

(beat)
That's the way I love Helen.

Priam nods and contemplates the goddess of beauty.

PRIAM
I've fought many wars in my time.
Some were fought for land, some for
power, some for glory.
(beat)
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

Paris says nothing, but his father's words seem to relieve
a great burden from his shoulders.

PRIAM
But I won't be the one fighting.

He hands Paris the bundle. Paris, curious, begins
unwrapping the cloth. Finally the object is uncovered: a
shining sword, expertly forged, inscribed with the seal of
Troy.
PARIS
The Sword of Troy.

PRIAM

My father carried this sword, and
his father before him, all the way
back to the founding of Troy. The
history of our people was written
with this sword.

(beat)
Carry it with you tomorrow.

Paris holds the sword up and it glows in the moonlight.

PRIAM
The spirit of Troy is in that
sword. As long as a Trojan carries
it, our people have a future.

INT. HECTOR'S CHAMBER — NIGHT 78

Hector sits on the bed beside Andromache, who nurses their
baby boy.
(CONTINUED)

78 CONTINUED: 78
Hector looks exhausted. He stares at his son.

HECTOR
He has no idea what's happening.

ANDROMACHE
Thank the gods.

HECTOR
The man who killed Tecton outside
Apollo's temple —— I've never seen
a spear thrown like that. An
impossible throw.

A long beat until Andromache breaks the silence.

ANDROMACHE
Briseis was in Apollo's temple this
morning.

Hector stares at Andromache.

HECTOR
Are you sure?

She nods, swallows hard, and closes her eyes. After a
moment Hector, his eyes full of sorrow, runs his hand
through her long hair.

HECTOR
I need to see my brother.
ANDROMACHE
Don't go.
HECTOR

I need to speak with him.

ANDROMACHE
I mean tomorrow. Don't go. You've
fought enough. Let other men go
out there.

HECTOR
You think I want to fight, my love?
I want to see my son grow tall. I
want to see the girls chasing after
him.

ANDROMACHE
Just like they chased his father?

For a moment they sit quietly, watching their son.

ANDROMACHE
I lost seven brothers in the
Spartan Wars. You'd think I'd be
good at losing by now.
(beat)
I can't lose you. I won't survive.

Hector stares at her for a beat before pulling her close
and kissing her. Everything is in this kiss, their entire
past. Andromache finally lets him go and Hector walks out
the door.

INT. PALACE HALL — LATER 79
As Hector walks to Paris's room, he spies someone in a
dark cloak sneaking down the candle—lit hallway —— an
assassin?
HECTOR
Wait!

The cloaked figure looks back and then runs. Hector
chases. The fugitive runs through the archway at the end
of the corridor and into the garden.

EXT. PALACE GARDEN — CONTINUOUS 8O

Hector runs into the garden. He's far faster. He seizes
his quarry and pulls aside the fugitive's cowl. It's
Helen.

HECTOR
Helen?

By the light of the moon he examines her face. The stress
of recent weeks has taken its toll, but the shadows
beneath her eyes make her face more compelling than ever.

Embarrassed by the awkwardness of their position, Hector
stands and helps Helen to her feet.

HECTOR
What are you doing out ——

Helen runs. Hector catches her again after a few strides.

HELEN
Let me go.

HECTOR
Where?

Helen struggles against Hector's grip, but it's useless.

HELEN
Let me go!

Helen, still struggling, begins to cry. Hector pulls her
to his chest. She cries for real now, violently sobbing,
her mouth muffled against Hector's body.

HECTOR
Shh. Shh.

HELEN
I saw them burn. I saw them
burning on the pyres.
(beat)
It's my fault.

HECTOR
No.

HELEN
It is. You know it is. All those
widows. I still hear them
screaming.

Helen takes a deep breath. She manages to control
herself.

HELEN
Their husbands died because I'm
here.

Hector can't deny this. Helen pushes herself out of his
grip.

HELEN
I'm going down to the ships.

HECTOR
No. You're not.

HELEN
I'll give myself back to Menelaus.
He can do what he wants —— kill me,

make me his slave. Anything's
better than this.

HECTOR
It's too late for that. You think
Agamemnon cares about his brother's
marriage? This is about power.

Not love.
HELEN
Paris is going to fight in the
morning.
HECTOR
Yes.
HELEN

Menelaus will kill him.
Hector looks away, the words hurting him.

HELEN
I won't let that happen.

HECTOR
It's his decision.

HELEN
No. No. I can't ask anyone to
fight for me. I'm no longer queen
of Sparta.

Hector bows to Helen and kisses her hand.

HECTOR
You're a princess of Troy. And my
brother needs you tonight.

Helen stares at Hector in wonder. The words seem to
bolster her spirit, and she smiles though her eyes are
still wet. She nods, touches his arm and goes back to the
palace.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — DAWN 81
Up and down the beach thousands of GREEK WARRIORS prepare
for battle. Despite their vast numbers, the men are oddly

quiet, each absorbed with his own thoughts.
(CONTINUED)

81

82

75.
CONTINUED: 8l

CLOSE ON SEVERAL FACES —— these are men we haven't seen
before and probably won't see again, not kings or heroes
but ordinary men preparing for battle.

One warrior prays with eyes closed, mumbling the words,
kneeling in the sand. A second man inspects each
arrowhead in his quiver. A third sits in the sand,
snapping seashells.

INT. ACHILLES' TENT — LATER — DAY 82

Achilles sits cross—legged, arms held straight out in
front of him, palms up. His bronze sword is balanced on
his palms.

Patroclus and Eudorus, armored for battle, enter the tent.
Achilles does not look away from his blade. Though the
sword must be heavy, his arms do not tremble.

EUDORUS
My lord? The army is marching.

ACHILLES
Let them march. We stay.

EUDORUS
But the men ——

Achilles turns to glare at him and Eudorus falters.

EUDORUS
—— the men are ready.

ACHILLES
Agamemnon spat on my honor
yesterday. I promised that girl
her safety and he stole her from
me. Let him fight the Trojans
today.

Eudorus and Patroclus exchange glances. Eudorus bows to
Achilles and exits the tent. Patroclus remains behind.

ACHILLES
When I was very small I saw my
father kill a man with his bare
hands.

Patroclus doesn't know how to respond to this.

(CONTINUED)

ACHILLES
There's so much blood in a human
body.

Achilles flips the sword in the air and catches it by the
hilt. He examines the edge.

ACHILLES
You're ready to fight, Patroclus?

PATROCLUS
I am.

Achilles rests his sword on the ground. He stares at
Patroclus for a moment before speaking.

ACHILLES
You're ready to kill?

Patroclus hesitates.

ACHILLES
At night I see their faces. All
the men I've killed. I see them
standing on the far bank of the
River Styx.
(beat)
They're waiting for me.

Patroclus stands absolutely still. He's never heard his
cousin speak this way before.

ACHILLES
Some nights I walk among them.
When I wake I can still hear their
words.
(beat)
They say, "Welcome, brother."

Achilles inspects the knuckles of his fist.

ACHILLES

Never hate the men you fight. All
of us are mortals. All of us,
wretched things, tumbled crying
from our mother's loins.

(beat)
Only the gods are free from
sorrows.

PATROCLUS
I hate no one, cousin.

ACHILLES
Good.

I taught you how to fight. But I
never taught you why to fight.

PATROCLUS
I fight for you.
ACHILLES
And who will you follow when I'm

gone?
Patroclus hesitates, unsure how to answer.

ACHILLES
Most soldiers battle for kings
they've never met. They do what
they're told; they die when they're
told to die.

PATROCLUS
Soldiers obey.

ACHILLES
We don't have much time to walk in
the sun, Patroclus. After this
life comes the underworld, an
eternity telling stories to other
shades. Don't tell them you died
following some fool's orders.

PATROCLUS
And what should I tell them?

ACHILLES
Tell them your name. If your life
has been worthy, they'll know the
rest.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — DAY 85

One thousand ARCHERS stand in various positions on the
broad city walls, quivers of arrows by their sides.
TROJAN CITIZENS also crowd atop the walls, quiet and
sober.

Priam sits in a grandstand beneath a blue canopy. Seated
by him are CITY LEADERS, including Velius and
Archeptolemus.

Helen stands apart from everyone else. No one is overtly
hostile to her, but behind her back people stare and
whisper.

84

84A

84B

78.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD — CONTINUOUS 84

Below the walls, on the broad field that stretches down
from the city gates, the TROJAN ARMY has amassed. In the
front, Hector and General Glaucus sit astride their
horses.

The soldiers are disciplined and well—outfitted, arranged
in tight formation.

Paris rides out to join Hector. Hector examines Paris's
face.

HECTOR
Are you sure you want to do this?

PARIS
I started this war.

Paris searches the faces atop the city wall. He finds
Helen.

CLOSE on Helen. The wind is blowing hard, ruffling her
cloak, her hair. There is love in her eyes, and fear and
exhaustion. Paris stares up at her for a long time before
turning away.

A low, ominous RUMBLE grows steadily louder. Hector hears
it first. He looks down the vast sloping field toward the
sea.

Now the other soldiers hear it, and then the citizens atop
the walls. All speech ceases. The Trojans quietly wait.

The rumbling resolves into the steady beat of WAR DRUMS.

EXT. BEACH — DUNES 84A

And now we see them, fifty thousand GREEKS. The
reflection of sunlight off fifty thousand bronze shields,
fifty thousand bronze helmets and chest plates, is
spectacular —— the army looks like a river of lava,
flowing uphill.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY 84B

The Trojan soldiers don't quiver or waver, but the
expressions on their faces betray their anxiety. The
Greek army is more than twice the size of the Trojan army.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — CONTINUOUS 85
The citizens shield their eyes from the brightness. They
exhibit their nervousness more openly than the soldiers.
One OLD WOMAN moans softly, her hand over her mouth.
EXT. BLUFF — DAY 86
Patroclus, Eudorus, and the rest of the Myrmidons climb to
the top of a tall bluff near the beach. From here they
can see the broad battlefield a mile away.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD — DAY 87
The Greek army halts just beyond arrow range. A
delegation of kings —— Agamemnon, Nestor, Menelaus,
Odysseus, and Ajax —— on CHARIOTS proceeds to the center
of the battlefield.

Odysseus looks over his shoulder and then yells to Ajax.

ODYSSEUS
Where's Achilles?

Ajax looks around and shrugs.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD BETWEEN ARMIES 87A

Hector and Paris spur their horses and canter out to meet
the Greeks. The brothers speak without looking at each
other.

HECTOR
Menelaus is a bull. He'll charge
you.
Paris nods.
HECTOR

He's stronger than you, so try not
to fight him up close. Keep your
distance. Use your quickness.

Paris leans over and tries to spit, but his mouth is too
dry.

HECTOR
Brother?

Paris, his face ashen, looks at Hector.

HECTOR
You don't have to do this.

Menelaus.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — DAY 88

Helen, alone, views the battlefield. An old, spotted hand
takes her elbow. She turns and looks into Priam's eyes.

PRIAM
Sit with me.

Helen follows the king to his grandstand and sits beside
him. She's aware of people staring at them but he seems
oblivious.

PRIAM
All my life I've prayed against
this day.

HELEN
Yes, my king.

PRIAM

Call me father, dear child.

Startled by this affection, she hesitates before
responding.

HELEN
Forgive me, father. For...

She pauses, staring out at the vast Greek army.

HELEN
...bringing this.

Priam shakes his head and smiles sadly.

PRIAM
I blame you for nothing.
Everything is in the hands of the
gods.
(beat)
Besides, how could I blame anyone
for falling in love with Paris?

Helen looks out at the battlefield, fixing on Paris, at
this distance a tiny figure on horseback. Priam takes
her hand.

89

81.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD — DAY 89

Hector and Paris ride up to the Greek kings. Menelaus
stares at Paris, his fingers tapping the hilt of his
sword. Paris does not make eye contact.

The kings step down from their chariots and the Trojan
princes dismount from their horses. Both armies are lined
up several hundred yards apart.

Agamemnon surveys the Trojan army.

AGAMEMNON
I see you're not hiding behind your
high walls. Valiant of you. Ill—
advised, but valiant.

HECTOR
You come here uninvited. Go back
to your ships. Go home.

AGAMEMNON
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

MENELAUS
Prince? These are not princes.
What son of a king would accept a
man's hospitality, eat his food,
drink his wine, and then steal his
wife in the middle of the night?

PARIS
The sun was shining when your wife
left you.

Menelaus draws his sword. He points it at the city walls.

MENELAUS
She's up there watching, isn't she?
Good. I want her to watch you die.

Agamemnon places a hand on his brother's arm.

AGAMEMNON
Not yet, brother.

He makes a sweeping gesture, indicating his entire army.

AGAMEMNON
Look around you, Hector. I've
brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

NESTOR
You can still save Troy, young
prince.
AGAMEMNON

I have two wishes. If you grant
them, no more of your people need
to die. First, give Helen back to
my brother. Second, Troy must
submit to my command, to fight for
me whenever I call.

HECTOR
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble. Well, I see them. I
see fifty thousand men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

AGAMEMNON
Be careful, boy. My mercy has
limits.

HECTOR

I've seen the limits of your mercy.
And I tell you now that no son of
Troy will ever submit to a foreign
ruler.

AGAMEMNON
Then every son of Troy shall die.

PARIS
There is another way.

Everyone watches Paris now.

PARIS
(to Menelaus)
I love Helen. I won't give her up.
And neither will you. So let's
fight our own battle. Let the
winner take Helen home, and that
will be the end of it.

AGAMEMNON
A brave offer. But not enough.

Menelaus pulls Agamemnon aside and speaks to him out of
the others' earshot.

MENELAUS
Let me kill this little peacock.

(CONTINUED)

AGAMEMNON
I didn't come here for your pretty
wife. I came for Troy.

MENELAUS
And I came for my honor. His every
breath insults me.

(beat)

Let me kill him. When he's lying
in the dust, give the signal to
attack. I'll have my revenge and
you'll have your city.

Agamemnon ponders the offer. He nods. They rejoin the
others.

MENELAUS
(to Paris)
I accept your challenge. And
tonight I'll drink to your bones.

He walks over to his chariot and grabs his shield. Hector
helps Paris into his helmet and speaks quietly to him.

HECTOR
He doesn't have the stamina he once
did. Make him swing and miss.
He'll tire.

Paris nods. He turns toward Menelaus but quickly turns
back and grabs Hector's arm.

PARIS
Hector!

Hector waits. Paris opens his mouth but no words come
out. He tries again.

PARIS
If I fall —— tell Helen —— tell
her ——

HECTOR
I will.

PARIS

Don't let Menelaus hurt her. Make
him swear ——

HECTOR
Think about your sword and his
sword. Nothing else.

Hector hugs him close for a moment and releases him.
Paris walks toward the center of the field, where Menelaus
waits.

PARIS'S POV 89A

It's difficult to see from inside your bronze helmet.
Your peripheral vision is severely restricted, and the
nose guard bisects your vision.

Your breathing sounds amplified, impossibly loud and half—
panicked. But there's no turning back. Menelaus stands
in the center of the vast battlefield, patient and
menacing, carving the air with lazy strokes of his sword.

You look back and see Hector. Hector nods, trying to
encourage you, but he looks worried. Behind Hector is the
Trojan army, twenty—five thousand silent men.

Behind the army is the city of Troy. Atop those walls,
beneath that blue canopy, your father is watching, and the
woman you love.

You turn back to Menelaus. He's smiling at you.

BACK TO SCENE 89B

Menelaus charges at Paris and swings mightily, trying to
knock the prince's head from his shoulders. Paris manages
to duck beneath the flashing blade.

Menelaus fights with little art and great savagery,
exploiting his superior strength. Paris is quicker. He
nearly surprises the bigger man with a fast sword thrust,
but Menelaus dominates the fight, hammering Paris's shield
with a furious barrage of blows.

Paris steps away and tries another thrust, but this time
Menelaus sidesteps and smashes Paris in the jaw with the
hilt of his sword, knocking the prince's helmet off.

Paris falls, blood leaking from his nose and mouth.

Hector, frustrated and powerless to help, tries to will
his brother to victory.

EUDORUS
Menelaus still knows how to fight.

Menelaus swings at the fallen prince but Paris is able to
block the blow with his shield and scramble to his feet.
Menelaus points to the sky. Three CROWS circle above.

MENELAUS
You see the crows?
(beat)
They've never tasted a prince
before.

The Spartan's mind games are working —— Paris wears the
face of a man who doesn't want to fight. He swings
clumsily and Menelaus manages to catch his wrist. The
Spartan grins and raises his sword for the kill.

Paris lashes out with his free hand, punching the Spartan

hard in the jaw. Menelaus grunts and shoves the Trojan
away. He spits out a tooth. He's no longer smiling.

MENELAUS 92B

But Menelaus bores in again, blow after blow. Finally his
bronze blade bites into Paris's thigh. Paris staggers
backward, blood flowing down his leg. He swings
desperately but Menelaus parries, knocking the sword from
Paris's hand.

Paris stares at his fallen sword, five feet away.

Paris runs. Menelaus snarls and chases after him.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — CONTINUOUS 95

The citizens seem shocked that their prince and hero would
flee before a Greek assailant. They look at each other
and whisper, glancing at Priam, curious to see his
reaction.

PRIAM

Fight him, son. Fight him.

Helen stares at the battlefield, her face unreadable.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — CONTINUOUS 94

Paris runs to Hector, gasping for breath, the blood
pouring down his face and leg. He falls to his knees
before his older brother. Hector stares at Paris and then
at Menelaus, who has stopped seven feet from the princes.

MENELAUS
Fight me, you coward! Fight me!

Paris, unable to look at either man or speak, trembles by
his brother's side. Hector, completely at a loss, lays
his hand on Paris's head.

MENELAUS
We have a pact. Fight!

HECTOR looks from his brother to the enraged Menelaus.

MENELAUS
This is not honor. This is not
worthy of royalty.

Hector looks at his brother but Paris is not looking at

anybody. He gasps for breath, the blood streaming from

his wounds. Hector glances at the Greek army, then back
to Paris.

MENELAUS
If he doesn't fight, Troy is
doomed.

HECTOR
Paris.

Paris shakes his head, blood dripping from his nose.

PARIS
No. No.

HECTOR

The fight is over.

MENELAUS
The fight is not over. Stand back,
Prince Hector.

Hector stares at the king, judging his intentions.

MENELAUS
I'll kill him at your feet. I
don't care.

HECTOR
He's my brother.

Menelaus charges, sword raised overhead. In one motion
Hector draws his own sword and plunges the point through
Menelaus's breastplate. Menelaus's momentum carries him

AGAMEMNON standing on his chariot in front of his army,

silent.

Agamemnon SHOUTS. A wordless cry of rage, echoing from
the Greek lines to the walls of Troy. He points toward
Hector.

The entire Greek army surges forward. Hollering with a
collective violence powerful enough to make the ground
tremble, fifty thousand soldiers charge at Hector.

the concussive force of Greek feet and horses' hooves.

HECTOR
Paris.

Paris still seems to be in a state of shock.

HECTOR
Get up. Get up!

The avalanche of Greek infantry is getting closer. Paris
finally gets to his feet but runs in the wrong direction,
toward the Greeks.

HECTOR
Paris!

What seems to be a sprint to suicide turns out to be
something different: Paris grabs the fallen sword of Troy
from the ground, dangerously close to the charging Greeks.

He turns and dashes back to Hector. The princes mount.

Patroclus turns and sees Achilles, standing on a high rock
behind the other Myrmidons. We don't know how long
Achilles has been watching the battle.

ACHILLES
Pull back, you fool.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — CONTINUOUS 96

The Greek army continues to charge at full speed.
One thousand TROJAN ARCHERS notch their arrows and pull
back their catgut strings.

One thousand bronze—tipped arrows soar into the air, a
deadly swarm of hornets that rises toward the clouds

Hundreds of Greeks fall. The Trojan archers let loose
another swarm of arrows. The arrows fall with a great
HISS. Many find their mark, biting into the throats and
faces of the Greeks.

The Greek army, so overwhelming seconds ago, is now struck
with chaos. The men in the front turn back, realizing
they've become targets, while the men in back still push
forward. In this confusion of foot traffic the arrows
continue to fall, a rainstorm of bronze.

Agamemnon, standing on his chariot in the middle of his
frenzied troops, tries to maintain order, but his shouts
go unheard above the general roar.

The driver of his chariot falls, an arrow through his
neck.

Agamemnon grabs the reins and tries to steer the chariot,
but so many men are running about, so many bodies litter
the ground, that maneuvering is extremely difficult.

CUT TO:

EXT. WALLS OF TROY 96A

HECTOR AND PARIS have reached the city walls, where
Glaucus and the army wait for them. Hector grabs Paris's
arm.

HECTOR
Get inside the city.

He slaps Paris's horse. Paris, head bowed, rides away.
Hector turns to his army. He shouts to them at the top of
his lungs.

HECTOR
The commander of the Greeks wants
the Trojan army to fight for him!

The Trojan mood becomes more and more bellicose.

HECTOR
Would any man here like to fight
for Agamemnon?

TROJANS

Hector raises his sword and points it at the Greeks, who
retreat from the arrow fusillade in disarray.

The Trojans charge. Hector, on horseback, reaches the
Greeks first. His sword cuts down everyone within reach.

The Trojan infantry attacks the Greeks, whose line has
been broken by the rain of arrows. The Trojans take
advantage of their enemies' panic. Hector's plan has
succeeded.

EXT. BLUFF — CONTINUOUS 97

Achilles is unable to stand still. His fingers twitch as
he watches the battle; he paces back and forth and curses.
Patroclus and the Myrmidons avoid looking at their leader.

ACHILLES
Get them in line... get them in
line...
EXT. BATTLEFIELD — CONTINUOUS 98

Odysseus, meanwhile, works to reorganize the troops.

ODYSSEUS
Selepius! Bring your men back into
line!

Ajax, standing nearby, sees Hector chopping his way
through the Greeks. Ajax runs at Hector.

Two TROJAN SOLDIERS try to intercept Ajax. The mighty
Greek swings his huge battle axe. The blade cuts clean
through the first soldier's arm and halfway through his
torso.

The second soldier hacks at Ajax but the big man blocks
the sword with his shield and then uses the shield to ram
the soldier's face. Blood sprays from the Trojan's
crushed skull. Both soldiers fall dead to the ground.

Hector, battling a Greek INFANTRYMAN, doesn't see Ajax
coming. Ajax grabs Hector's horse's bridle and tugs hard,
the veins in his arms bulging beneath the skin.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 98

The horse tries to buck but Ajax twists the horse's head
till it falls. Hector falls with the horse, tumbling to
the dirt. The Greek infantryman he had been fighting
stabs at him.

Hector rolls away and manages —— while flat on his back
—— to swing his sword, chopping off the infantryman's feet
just above the ankles. The infantryman screams and falls.

Ajax releases the horse, raises his axe, and swings at the
fallen Hector. The prince gets his shield up just in
time. Ajax's axe cleaves through the shield, splitting
the bronze into two even halves.

Hector stares at the halved shield, discards it, and jumps
to his feet. The two fighters circle each other while
thousands of soldiers around them battle to the death.

AJAX
So you're the best of the Trojans?

Hector, looking for an opening in the brute's defenses,
says nothing. Ajax charges, swinging his battle axe.

Hector ducks below the axe and lunges forward with his
sword, but Ajax —— quick despite his size —— sidesteps,
grabs the smaller man in a bear hug and squeezes.

Hector turns red. The sword falls from Hector's hand.
Ajax grins.

Hector slams his helmeted head forward, butting Ajax in
the face. Ajax staggers back, blood spraying from his
nose, his axe falling to the ground.

Hector struggles to regain his equilibrium. Ajax growls
and launches himself at the prince.

Hector snatches a spear off the ground and positions it
just as Ajax dives at him. The spear pierces Ajax's
armor, driving through his belly and out his back. Hector
holds the shaft steady. Ajax stares down at his wound.

He seems more irritated than anything else.

Ajax places his two big hands on the spear shaft, right
where the spear enters his body. He breaks the spear in
two, snapping the solid wood like a twig.

Half a spear still sticking out his back, Ajax swings the
shaft, clobbering Hector in the side of the head, sending
the horsehair—plumed helmet flying.

Hector, dazed, falls to one knee. Ajax whacks him again
on the back of his neck. Hector crawls forward blindly.
His hands brush over the blade of his dropped sword.

Hector springs up, driving his sword into Ajax's gut, just
below the big man's breast plate. Hector withdraws his
sword. Both men see the ground drenched with Ajax's
blood.

Ajax backhands Hector with the broken spear shaft,
cracking the prince in the jaw and dropping him again.
Ajax grabs Hector, hoists him upright and begins
throttling the prince. Ajax spits a great wad of blood
and smiles, teeth washed red.

Hector tries to kick at Ajax, but Ajax's thumbs dig deeper
and deeper into Hector's throat. Hector's eyelids begin
to flutter as he chokes.

But the Salamisian king has lost too much blood. He sinks
slowly to his knees. Hector is forced to his knees as
well.

Finally Ajax's eyes roll back. He topples onto Hector,
hands still locked on the prince's throat. Hector undoes
the death grip. He squirms out from under Ajax's corpse
and stands.

EXT. BLUFF — CONTINUOUS 99
Patroclus and the Myrmidons watch Ajax fall with

disbelief. Achilles cannot bear to watch any longer. He
walks away. None of his men dare look at him.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — DAY 100

The Trojans are routing the Greeks. With two of their
kings already fallen, the Greek force is in disarray.

Odysseus sees Agamemnon speeding by on his chariot.
Odysseus runs and manages to leap onto the chariot. The
two kings shout at each other above the commotion of
battle.

Agamemnon seems dazed by the turn of events. Finally
Odysseus hollers to whichever CAPTAINS can hear his voice.

ODYSSEUS
Back to the ships! Back to the
ships!

The captains take up this cry, shouting orders to their
men.

The Greeks retreat. The Trojan soldiers give a mighty
shout as they pursue their enemies.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY 101

The people cheer. Nobles and commoners embrace as
brothers.

Hector, still on foot, leads his men as they chase down
the fleeing Greeks. Several thousand Greeks have fallen.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT 105

The Greeks get back to their trenches, the bulk of the
force still intact. ARCHERS in the Greek rear guard,
manning the trenches, now raise their bows and prepare to
fire.

Hector, eager to avoid the mistakes his Greek counterparts
made earlier, holds up his hands and BELLOWS to the
troops.

HECTOR

range. Lysander, the Trojan captain, stands beside
Hector.

Have the men gather our fallen.
When they're done, send an emissary
to the Greeks. They can collect
their dead without fear of assault.

LYSANDER
Would they have done the same for us?

HECTOR
Of course not. That's why Troy is
worth defending.

Hector turns and heads back to the white city.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — LATER lO4

Thousands of BODIES litter the broad field. We see them
first from high above, their bronze armor gleaming in the
failing sunlight. CLOSE on several of the dead men's
faces.

The living haul the dead from the battlefield. HORSES
are used to pull wagonloads of bodies.

Fathers or sons or brothers or friends say their goodbyes
and wash the dead men with washcloths and buckets of
water.

The sun sinks into the ocean. Both sides build funeral
pyres for their fallen. When a body is loaded onto the
pyre, a relative or friend places two COINS on the dead
man's eyes.

Dozens of SALAMISIANS view Ajax's body. They weep as they
pass by, each man kneeling to kiss their fallen king's

hand.

Paris flinches as Helen, using needle and thread, stitches

Helen, concentrating on her stitching, says nothing.
Paris flinches as the needle pierces his skin.

PARIS

HELEN

Nestor sits at a table, poring over the map of Troy.
Odysseus lies in a hammock strung between two of the tent
poles, eating olives and spitting out the pits.

Agamemnon paces the rugs that floor the tent. His usual
air of supreme confidence is gone, replaced by agitation.

My brother's blood still wets the
grass and you insult him?

ODYSSEUS
It's no insult to say a dead man is
dead.

If we leave now we lose all
credibility. If the Trojans can
beat us so easily, how long before
the Hittites invade?

ODYSSEUS
You're right. But if we stay, we
stay for the right reasons.

We stay to protect Greece, not your
pride. Your private battle with
Achilles is destroying us.

AGAMEMNON
Achilles is one man. What good
could he ——

ODYSSEUS

Hector is one man. Look what he
did to us today.

Achilles, the man won't listen.
He's just as likely to spear me as
speak with me.

ODYSSEUS
I'll talk to him in the morning.

Agamemnon thinks about it for a moment and nods.

NESTOR
He'll want the girl back.

AGAMEMNON
He can take the damned girl. I
haven't touched her.

ODYSSEUS
Where is she?

AGAMEMNON
I gave her to the men. They needed
some amusement after today.

Odysseus and Nestor exchange worried looks.

EXT. GREEK CAMPFIRE — NIGHT 108

A band of battle—weary, drunken SOLDIERS stand by a
campfire. They're exhausted, caked with dirt and their
comrades' blood.

They shove Briseis back and forth between them. Each man
she bounces into tears off a strip of her robes, which are
now filthy rags barely covering her body.

Her face seems to have shut down. She has a bruise below
one eye and her hair is wet with wine. The soldiers stare
at her with a mix of hostility and lust.

APHAEREUS
You Trojan whore.

No, she's Agamemnon's property.

sleeve)
What's this? A Virgin's robe?

HAEMON
You won't be needing that much
longer.

Haemon squats by the fire, holding an iron in the flames.
He pulls out a branding iron in the shape of Agamemnon's
seal: a white—hot ALPHA. He carries it toward Briseis.

HAEMON
Hold her down.

Briseis sees the hot iron and begins to struggle,
screaming and kicking at the men. Four of the soldiers
pin her down.

HAEMON
Why are you kicking, girl? Better
to be a Spartan slave than a Trojan
priestess.

Briseis claws Haemon in the face. He growls and punches
her.

HAEMON
Come on, come on, hold her down.

The soldiers hold her in the sand. Haemon steadies the
hot brand and searches for the best place to mark her.

When the brand is inches from her arm someone grabs the
iron, pulls it out of Haemon's hands and then slams it
down on the man's head. Haemon collapses.

Achilles stands alone, unarmed save for the branding iron.
By firelight he looks ferocious. Echepolus stumbles
backward.

beach.

ACHILLES
Nine.

The other soldiers run. Achilles lifts Briseis to her
feet. More gently than we would have believed possible,
Achilles brushes the sand from her face and hair.

ACHILLES
Can you walk?

Briseis nods. Achilles, arm around her shoulder, leads
her away from the campfire.

EXT. ACHILLES' TENT — NIGHT 109

Eudorus and Patroclus are waiting when Achilles and
Briseis get to the tent.

ACHILLES
Get me food and water. And a new
robe.

Eudorus bows. Patroclus watches Achilles and Briseis
enter the tent.

INT. ACHILLES' TENT — LATER 110

Achilles sits near Briseis, watching her. She's clean
now, dressed in a new robe —— a man's robe, far too big
for her. Platters of fruit and roasted meats sit near
her, along with pitchers of wine and water. Briseis
doesn't touch any of it.

ACHILLES
You should eat.

Briseis says nothing.

I like dogs more than people.

Briseis stares into Achilles' eyes. He's not used to
people meeting his gaze. He stares back at the girl,
intrigued.

BRISEIS

Why did you choose this life?
ACHILLES

What life?
BRISEIS

This... to be a great warrior.
ACHILLES

I chose nothing. I was born and
this is what I am.

BRISEIS
But you must enjoy it.

ACHILLES
Does the scorpion feel joy when he
stings the beetle?
(beat)
I doubt it. I doubt he feels
anything at all.

BRISEIS
But you're not a scorpion. You're

god. Where was Apollo when those
men tried to scar you?

BRISEIS
Do you enjoy provoking me?

They watch each other, Achilles smiling, Briseis angry.

ACHILLES
You've dedicated your life to the
gods, yes?

Briseis, glaring at him, doesn't answer.

ACHILLES
Zeus, God of Thunder. Athena,
Goddess of Wisdom. You serve them?

BRISEIS
Of course.

ACHILLES
And Aries, God of War, who blankets
his bed with the skins of men he's
killed?

Briseis pauses, caught in the trap.

BRISEIS
All the gods are to be feared and
respected.

For a long beat they are silent, staring at each other.
The air between them is charged with more than mere
contention.

BRISEIS
What do you want here in Troy? You
didn't come for the Spartan queen.

ACHILLES
I want what all men want. I just
want it more.

Achilles takes an apple and unsheathes a dagger. He
tosses the apple in his hand. On the third toss he whips
his knife—hand up and across and neatly catches four apple
quarters.

He offers a quarter to Briseis. Stunned, she slowly
shakes her head. Achilles shrugs and eats the sliced
apple.

envy us because we're mortal,
because every moment might be our
last. Everything is more beautiful
for the doomed.

He stares at her with such intensity she must look away.

ACHILLES
You will never be lovelier than you
are right now. And we will never
be here again.

Briseis is quiet for a moment. She rubs the ripe purple
grapes on the platter beside her.

Many of them.

For several seconds she holds the knife to his throat.
Finally she puts it down.

BRISEIS
May Apollo forgive me.

Achilles pulls her closer and they kiss.

He slowly slides the robe off her shoulders. Briseis ——
eyes closed, lips parted —— trembles as Achilles unveils
her. For a moment she hesitates but soon hesitation
evaporates and she presses her body against his, kissing
his throat, his chest, his hands.

Their hunger for each other is stronger than gods and
nations.

Rosy—fingered dawn appears. The seagulls cry above the
waves.

Achilles watches Briseis sleep. She looks very young and
fragile, her face bruised, her eyelids fluttering as she
dreams. Achilles watches her with great tenderness.

Eudorus opens the tent flap. Sunlight streams in.

Achilles puts a finger over his mouth. Eudorus sees

Briseis and nods. Achilles gently pulls the blanket over

Not as badly as those who hurt her.

Achilles stares at the sea. Seagulls patrol the skies.

ACHILLES

Do you miss your wife, Odysseus?
ODYSSEUS

Always.
ACHILLES

I've never missed anyone in my
life. I used to think it was a
weakness, needing someone else.

ODYSSEUS
We all need someone else. Right
now, Greece needs you.

ACHILLES
Greece got along fine before I was
born and Greece will be Greece long
after I'm dead.

ODYSSEUS
I'm not talking about the land.
The valleys, the mountains —— they

honor. What are you doing in
thrall to that pig of a king?

ODYSSEUS
The world seems simple to you, my
friend. But when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy like
Agamemnon.

You don't fear anyone, that's your

Women have a way of complicating

hand.

been standing by the tent throughout the previous
conversation.

PATROCLUS
We're going home?

ACHILLES
We leave at noon.

He tries to enter his tent but Patroclus grabs his arm and
blocks his path. Achilles stares at Patroclus' hand.
Patroclus releases him but doesn't move out of the way.

PATROCLUS
If Poseidon curses us and our ship
goes down, what will I tell the
shades in Hades? That I died
running from this war, abandoning
our countrymen?

Achilles, face inscrutable, watches his cousin walk away.
INT. PRIAM'S MEETING HALL — MORNING 116
The notables we've seen in this room before —— Priam,
Hector, Glaucus, Velior, Archeptolemus —— are gathered
again.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
The omens are gathering. The
directive is clear.

HECTOR
Fight for your country. That's the
only directive.

PRIAM

(to Hector)
The last time the high priest spoke
to us he prophesied a great victory
for Troy. We won a great victory.
Let him speak.

(to Archeptolemus)
What course of action do you
recommend?

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
The gods favor our cause. Now is
the time to destroy the Greek army.

PRIAM
Glaucus?

GLAUCUS
Their morale is battered. Hit them
now, hit them hard, and they will
run.

VELIOR
I must admit, I overestimated the
Greeks. They lack discipline and
courage.

Hector, frustrated and weary, rubs his eyes.

HECTOR

The Myrmidons did not fight
yesterday. There must be
dissension among the Greeks. But
if we attack their ships, we'll
unify them.

(beat)
If they decide to attack, let them.
They can't breach our walls. We'll
beat them back again.

(beat; to Priam)
Yesterday the Greeks underestimated
us. We should not return the favor
today.

Priam meditates on this conflicting advice. He stands and
paces about the room. He turns to Archeptolemus.

PRIAM
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo. The gods have
cursed the Greeks. Two of their
kings have already gone down to the
dust.

Priam continues pacing, hands clasped behind his back.

PRIAM
Prepare the army. We attack at
noon.

HECTOR

We're making a mistake, father.

Father and son face each other across the long table.

PRIAM
Prepare the army.

EXT. ACHILLES' WARSHIP — LATER — DAY 117

Achilles' ship has already been hauled into the shallow
water, ready to depart. Myrmidons climb the gangplank,
carrying gear onto the ship's deck.

INT. ACHILLES' WARSHIP — DAY 118

Briseis sits in the cabin watching Achilles tie a hammock
to a peg. Something has changed between them. She looks
at him with undisguised tenderness.

BRISEIS
Am I still your captive?

ACHILLES
Captive is a harsh word. You're my
guest.

BRISEIS
In Troy, guests can leave whenever
they want.

ACHILLES

Strange custom.

Achilles takes her hand and inspects her uncalloused
palms.

ACHILLES
You've never worked the fields.
Never chopped wood, never carried a
milk pail. These are the hands of
royalty.

Achilles raises his own hands and shows them to her.

ACHILLES
My hands are gates to the
underworld.
(beat)

All my life I've walked with Death.

But I grow tired of his company.
(beat)

Come with me to Larissa.

A hint of a smile crosses her lips.

BRISEIS
Larissa. Is that where you're
from?
(beat)
It's a pretty name.

ACHILLES
I thought I'd never see it again.
(beat)
Before I left home my mother told
me my fate.

BRISEIS
(sincere)
She speaks with the gods?

ACHILLES

She knows things.

(beat)
She told me if I stayed home I'd
have a long, peaceful life. And if
I came to Troy, life would be
short... but my name would never be
forgotten.

BRISEIS
And you chose Troy.

ACHILLES
But what if Fate brought me here
for another purpose? What if I had
to go to war to find peace?
(beat)
To find you?

She cups his face between her palms, pulls him closer,
kisses his lips. For a moment they gaze at each other,
until the sounds of WAR CRIES, HORNS, and BATTLE DRUMS
fill the air.

Achilles raises his head and listens, his face hardening.
Briseis, alarmed, watches him.

EXT. AGAMEMNON'S TENT — DAY 119

Agamemnon, Nestor, and Odysseus exit the tent. The beach
is a frenzy of activity. Thousands of men rush to their
positions, hastily arming themselves. The kings look to
the high dunes.

EXT. HIGH DUNES — CONTINUOUS 120

Hector and his APOLLONIAN GUARDS, on horseback, crest the
dunes and look down on the Greek encampment. 25,000
TROJAN FOOT SOLDIERS march behind Hector. He gives a
signal. The force halts.

121

121A

121C

115.
EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — CONTINUOUS 121

The GREEKS, plainly nervous, swarm to the long trench
they've dug. The Trojans crushed them yesterday. Now
they're back.

EXT. HIGH DUNES 121A

The Trojan ARCHERS pull their bows off their shoulders and
notch their arrows.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT 121B
The Greek archers notch their arrows.

Odysseus stands with his ITHACANS, waiting to battle. A
cry starts up on the far end of the Greek line and grows
steadily louder. Odysseus looks in that direction.

A glittering figure has stepped forth from the Myrmidon
camp, clad in the beautiful and distinctive armor that
every man in the Greek army recognizes.

ODYSSEUS
Achilles.

All down the Greek line we hear the cheer building to a
roar. Agamemnon, hearing the commotion, turns and sees
the shining warrior. He watches the spectacle with mixed
emotions.

Eudorus, standing with several Myrmidons, is thrilled by
his leader's unexpected arrival.

EUDORUS
Arm yourselves, men.

The Myrmidons quickly and excitedly arm themselves.

EXT. HIGH DUNES 121C

The Trojans are not aware of this energy. Hector raises
his sword and points at the Greeks. The Trojan army
charges. When they are within range the Trojan archers
release, sending a volley of arrows over the heads of
their comrades. The Greek archers release at the same
time.

Two flocks of arrows cross in the sky and swoop down on
the men below. Dozens of Greeks and Trojans fall to the
sand.

121D

114.
EXT. GREEK BEACH DEFENSES 121D

But now the glorious bronzed figure of Achilles leaps over
the trench, sunlight reflecting off his polished armor.

He raises his sword to the sky. A great, violent ROAR
rises from the Greek army. When he runs toward the
Trojans the Greeks jump from their positions and follow.

The two armies collide. Unlike the grassy field the men
fought on yesterday, today's battle takes place on the
sand, and sand is everywhere.

Horse hooves kick up clouds of sand. Men struggle for
footing in the loose sand. Red blood puddles on the
yellow sand.

But much more is different than the terrain. Now the
Greeks have a leader. The Myrmidons are at the forefront,
battling with a ferocity most Trojans have never seen
before.

A Trojan OFFICER, spear raised, gallops toward the figure
of Achilles. Before the Trojan can throw, Eudorus hurls
his spear, catching the officer in the neck. The man goes
down.

Odysseus, immersed in combat, sees this. He hesitates for
a moment and in his distraction is nearly cut down by an
axe—wielding Trojan. They fight.

After Odysseus dispatches the man, he looks back toward
the glittering figure of Achilles. Something's making him
uneasy.

A Trojan swings his sword at the shining warrior, narrowly
missing a clean decapitation. The Greek hero thrusts his
spear and guts the Trojan.

The Myrmidons surge forward, hacking their way through the
Trojans. The Greek army steadily pushes the Trojans back,
picking up more and more momentum.

Now it is the Trojans who seem frightened, unsure where
the Greeks found this intense spirit.

Glaucus, the Trojan general, on horseback, shouts to
Hector.

GLAUCUS
The gods are with them today! We
should fall back!

Hector, fighting, does not answer.

(CONTINUED)

121D

121E

115.
CONTINUED: 121D

The Myrmidons are getting closer to the elite Apollonians.
Hector notices them now. He notices the beautiful armor
of their leader, notices the leader hop nimbly from the
path of a charging Trojan and cut the man down.

HECTOR
(to himself)
Achilles.

Hector goes after him. He grips the reins and guides his
horse toward the Myrmidons. His Apollonians, clustered
about him protectively, move in that direction as well.

EXT. GREEK BEACH DEFENSES 121E

The two elite forces clash. These men are experts,
wielding their spears and swords with superior skill.

Hector's horse stumbles in the deep sand. Hector abandons
his mount, leaping down to the beach, running for the
shining warrior. A Myrmidon intercepts him. Their battle
is quick—— Hector kills him with a sword thrust.

Now he is face to face (or helmet to helmet) with the
figure of glorious Achilles. The two men, breathing
heavily from the combat, stand still for a moment.

The intricately—worked bronze of Achilles' helmet,
breastplate, and shield all shine bright. He's a
difficult man to stare at for long. Now he charges, sword
raised.

They fight. And though the battle continues all around
them, everyone seems to be aware of the duel taking place.

The shining warrior is quicker than Hector and lighter on
his feet, swinging again and again, a blaze of bronze.
Hector fights patiently, parrying the blows, waiting for
an opening.

The sword of Achilles whistles over Hector's head, swung
so hard that the man wielding it cannot protect himself.
Hector takes full advantage, swinging quickly, his blade
carving the soft flesh just beneath Achilles' helmet.

A long question mark of blood whips out of the cut throat.
The man falls.

(CONTINUED)

121E

116.
CONTINUED: 121E

Everything seems to stop. Though the battle is still
underway and thousands of individuals are still fighting
for their lives, a collective gasp of despair comes from
the Greeks.

Odysseus, stunned, stares at the body on the ground.
Hector stands next to the fallen man. He wedges the tip
of his sword inside the bronze helmet and lifts it off.

Patroclus is dying, trying to breathe as his throat floods
with blood. His eyes are panicked.

Hector stares down at the dying boy, at the blood—soaked
SEASHELL NECKLACE.

For a moment they stare at each other, the victorious
prince of Troy and the dying boy in the sand. The sounds
of Patroclus' gurgling breaths visibly upset the prince.

With an anguished cry he raises his sword and brings it
down. We don't see the blade hit, but the boy's suffering
ends.

Hector sees a stunned Odysseus standing nearby. The
Greeks have pushed the Trojans back from the beach, onto
the grassy inland plains, but now combat has halted.

HECTOR
Enough for one day?

Odysseus nods. Hector calls out to Glaucus.

HECTOR
Arms down! Back to the city!

Glaucus relays the call. Odysseus calls to his CAPTAINS.

ODYSSEUS
Arms down! Arms down! To the
beach!

Odysseus sheathes his sword and approaches. He crouches
by Patroclus and closes the dead boy's frightened eyes.
Hector and Odysseus look at each other for a beat.

Hector mounts his horse and leads his men home. The two

sides retreat. Eudorus hurries over and kneels beside the
dead boy.

EUDORUS
We were going to sail home at noon.

(CONTINUED)

ODYSSEUS
I don't think anyone's sailing home
now.
EXT. ACHILLES' WARSHIP — LATER 122

Eudorus walks up to the ship, takes a few deep breaths,
and calls to his commander.

EUDORUS
Achilles!

Achilles emerges from the ship's cabin and walks to the
bow. He descends the gangplank to the beach. Briseis
follows.

Eudorus bows. Achilles examines his captain. Eudorus is
sweaty and dirty, his hands caked with dried blood. His
helmet is off but he still wears his armor.

ACHILLES
You've been fighting.

EUDORUS
My lord ——

ACHILLES

You violated my command.

EUDORUS
No, my lord. There was a mistake.

ACHILLES
A mistake? I ordered the Myrmidons
to stand down. You led them into
combat?

EUDORUS
I didn't lead them.

Eudorus cannot meet his commander's gaze.

ACHILLES
Who did?

EUDORUS
We thought you did.

Now Achilles can tell, staring at his captain's face, that
something is very wrong. He looks around the encampment.
All the men returning from combat avoid looking at
Achilles.

(CONTINUED)

122

118.
CONTINUED: 122

ACHILLES
Where's Patroclus?

EUDORUS
We thought it was you, my lord. We
—— he wore your armor. Your
shield, your grieves, your helmet.
(long beat)
He's dead, my lord.

ACHILLES
You're lying.

EUDORUS
Never, my lord. Never. He looked
like you. He even moved like you.
We all followed ——

ACHILLES
Lies.

EUDORUS
He fought well, my lord. With
great courage. But Hector came
after him.

Achilles' nostrils are flared, his eyes narrowed.

EUDORUS
If I could have saved him ——

Achilles hits Eudorus hard in the mouth. The captain
falls to the sand. Achilles looms above him, fists
clenched. Eudorus holds his mouth. Blood is already
beginning to stream out.

ACHILLES
Liar!

EUDORUS
My lord, I saw him fall.

Achilles seizes Eudorus by the hair and hauls him to his
knees. He snatches Eudorus's sword and raises it.
Briseis grabs Achilles' shoulder.

BRISEIS
Don't!

With his free hand Achilles grabs her throat. She claws
at his wrist. Her feet spasm and kick inches off the
ground.

(CONTINUED)

122

125

124

119.
CONTINUED: (2) 122

Eyes bulging, she stares at him. Whatever kindness she'd
seen in his eyes before, whatever tenderness, it's gone
now.

Achilles drops her. She sags to the ground, gasping for
breath, beginning to sob. Achilles releases Eudorus. The
captain remains on his knees, watching his lord.

ACHILLES
Dead?

EUDORUS
Hector cut his throat.

Achilles walks to a dead campfire where the Myrmidons cook
their dinner. He drops Eudorus's sword and kneels in the
ashes, grabs handfuls of the soot, and blackens his face.

Achilles stands, grabs the sword, and walks toward the
sea. Everyone stares at him. He keeps walking as the
waters lap at his ankles, his knees, his waist.

The waves are high, crashing down on him, but Achilles
does not turn from them. He swings the sword, chopping
through the surf, slicing the crests off the waves,
groaning as he fights. The soldiers on the beach stare at
him.

Achilles battles the sea.

EXT. PALACE GARDEN — NIGHT 125

Hector, carrying a torch, leads Andromache through the
lower garden, down a staircase descending from the shrine
of Apollo to a door half—hidden by climbing vines. He
opens the door.

INT. PALACE OF TROY — SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL — NIGHT 124

Andromache follows Hector into the palace's dark recesses.

ANDROMACHE
Where are you taking me?

Hector leads her until they reach a bronze—banded oak
door. He opens the door, revealing the mouth of a dark
tunnel.

HECTOR
You remember how to get here?
ANDROMACHE

HECTOR

Next time you come, follow this
tunnel. There's nowhere to turn,
so you can't get lost. Keep
walking.

ANDROMACHE
Hector ——

HECTOR

When you get outside you'll be on
the south side of the Scamander
River. Follow the river till you
see Mount Ida. Keep Ida to your
west, walk south, and you'll get to
Lyrnessus.

The Greeks won't go that far
inland.

ANDROMACHE
You're frightening me.

Hector stares into the darkness of the tunnel.

ANDROMACHE
Hector.

Why are you telling me this?

HECTOR

If I die, I don't know how long the
city will stand.

ANDROMACHE
Don't say that.

HECTOR
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over. They'll kill all the
men. Doesn't matter how old,
they'll pull grandfathers from
their beds and carve their lungs
out.

ANDROMACHE
Please ——

HECTOR
Doesn't matter how young. They'll
throw the babies from the city
walls.

Andromache closes her eyes.

HECTOR
The women they'll take for slaves.
And that will be worse for you than
dying.

ANDROMACHE
Why are you saying these things?

HECTOR

I want you to be ready. I want you
to get our boy, get him, and come
here. Save as many others as you
can, but you get here, you go down
these stairs, and you run.

(beat)
Do you understand?

She nods. The flickering flame of the taper throws giant
shadows on the stone walls.

HECTOR
I killed a boy today.

He was too young. Much too young.

Achilles, clean now, all the soot washed away by the sea,
scrubs Patroclus's face with a damp cloth. As fastidious
as a mother, Achilles scrubs away the dried blood on the
boy's lips, the dirt on his chin, the crusted blood on his
cut throat. He removes the SHELL NECKLACE.
Agamemnon stands with Nestor in the crowd surrounding the
pyre. Agamemnon watches the rite with ill—concealed
pleasure.

AGAMEMNON
That boy just saved the war for us.

Odysseus stands nearby. Melancholy and fatigue age his
face.

When the boy is clean Achilles pulls two COINS from a
leather pouch. He places one coin over each of the dead
boy's eyes. He kisses the boy's forehead and descends

from atop the pyre. Eudorus hands him a torch and
Achilles sets the pyre on fire.

EXT./INT. MONTAGE — NIGHT 126

We visit all our characters tonight. First Achilles,
standing by the burning pyre, watching his cousin burn.

Briseis sits nearby, watching Achilles watch the fire.

Paris practices his archery, shooting a target again and

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — DAWN 127
Achilles, still standing in the same place, watches the
remaining wood of the pyre collapse. He walks to his
tent. On the way he passes Briseis. She has fallen
asleep on the sand.
He sees the bruises on her throat where his hand throttled
her. As usual, the expression on his face is unreadable.
He stares at her for another moment and walks away.
EXT. ACHILLES' TENT — DAWN 128

Achilles finds Eudorus sleeping outside his tent.

ACHILLES
Eudorus.

Eudorus blinks, unsure where he is, then rouses himself as
he recognizes his master's voice. He struggles to his
feet.
EUDORUS
My lord.

ACHILLES
I need my armor.

Eudorus nods and rushes off.

INT. ACHILLES' TENT — DAWN 129

Eudorus helps Achilles prepare, clasping on his greaves.

Achilles exits his tent, fully armed.

Eudorus is behind him. The SOLDIERS are beginning to stir
and they stop in their activity now and stare at him.

Two MYRMIDONS tether a CHARIOT to a large black HORSE.
The work finished, they step back as Achilles hops into
the chariot. Eudorus attempts to hop on behind him.

ACHILLES
No.

Eudorus looks at his commander for a second and backs
away.

ACHILLES
(to the Myrmidons)
Rope.

A Myrmidon hands him a coil of braided ROPE and retreats.

Briseis steps into View. Her eyes are shadowed from lack
of sleep. She stares up at Achilles and he looks at her.
She looks fragile today, her pale throat purpled with
bruises.

BRISEIS
Don't go.

Achilles watches her in silence.

BRISEIS

Hector is my cousin. He's a good
man.

Take me to Larissa with you. But
don't fight him. Please don't
fight him.

Priam and his COUNSELORS sit below the blue canopy.

Paris sits near them, but not with them. He doesn't look

Hector stands alone at one of the wall's turreted corners,
staring toward the sea.

Hector walks over to his father. Achilles keeps bellowing
his name. Hector kneels before his father and kisses his
hand.

HECTOR
Father. Forgive me for any
offenses. I've served you as best
I could.

Priam stands, beckons for Hector to rise, cups Hector's
cheeks in his palms and kisses Hector's forehead.

PRIAM
May the gods be with you.

Hector hesitates for a moment, then bows and turns to go.

PRIAM
Hector!

Hector turns back. Father and son look at each other.
For a moment we think Priam will be unable to speak.
Finally:

PRIAM
No father ever had a better son.

The words deeply move Hector. He bows again and moves on.
He passes by Glaucus, who bows to the prince.

GLAUCUS
Apollo guard you, my prince.

Hector claps the general's shoulder and keeps walking. He
stops beside Paris. They embrace.

EXT. STAIRS 140A

waits for him above the stairs leading to the city gates.
She holds their baby boy Scamandrius.

HECTOR
You remember what I told you?

ANDROMACHE
You don't have to go. You don't ——

HECTOR
You remember what I told you.

Andromache hasn't slept. Her hair is a wild tangle; her
eyes are rimmed red. She nods. She holds her son up to
his father. The boy doesn't see his father, he sees
something terrifying, a man with a bronze face and a plume
of horsehair.

Scamandrius begins to CRY. Hector removes his helmet.

Now the boy sees his father. He giggles and reaches out.
Hector takes the boy in his arms and holds him. He kisses
the boy's fuzzed head and closes his eyes for a moment.

Finally he hands the baby back to Andromache. He smiles
at his wife. She grabs him by the back of the head and
presses his face to hers. Her mouth is open, her eyes
closed, her body slack against his.

Finally he disengages himself. He walks away from her.
She and Scamandrius stare after him, but he never looks
back.

EXT. GATES (INSIDE CITY WALLS) 140B

walls. He stops at the massive city gates. The GATEMEN

feet away, her unearthly beauty greater than ever. As the
heavy gates rise, Helen and Hector stare at each other,
never blinking, never looking away.

Finally the gate is lifted. Hector bows to Helen and fits
his helmet on his head. He leaves the city. Helen
watches him go.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — DAY 141

Hector walks toward Achilles. Everything is very quiet.
The people on the walls are hushed. Even the birds seem
reverent.

Thousands and thousands of Greeks now line the high dunes,
making the valley an enormous amphitheater ringed with
spectators from the dunes to the walls of Troy.

Achilles stands motionless. The two men are alone on the
great field. Hector stops twenty feet away from Achilles.

HECTOR
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

Achilles, expressionless, stares at the prince.

HECTOR
I'll make a pact with you, with the
gods as our witnesses. Let us
pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral

rituals.
ACHILLES
There are no pacts between lions
and men.
Achilles tosses aside his helmet —— an insulting gesture,

impugning Hector's combat skills.

ACHILLES
Now you know who you're fighting.

Hector pauses a moment before removing his own helmet and
tossing it aside.

HECTOR
I thought it was you I was fighting
yesterday. I wish it had been you.
But I gave the dead boy the honor he ——

won't have ears, or a tongue.
You'll wander the underworld,
blind, deaf, and dumb. And all the
dead will know: this is Hector, the
fool who thought he killed
Achilles.

Achilles draws his sword. Hector draws his. They charge.

We've seen extraordinary fighting before, but we've never
seen this —— a prowess so extreme as to be hypnotic. Two
better swordsmen have never clashed. All their lives, all
their training and past battles, have led to this moment.

Nothing is wasted. No flourishes or balletic leaps or
spins. Every swing is a death blow countered. The
rapidity of the exchange is breathless.

The bronze blades hiss as they split the air. They swing
with such power that sparks fly whenever a sword scrapes a
shield.

EXT. HIGH DUNES — DAY 142

Agamemnon, Nestor, and Odysseus stand with their men. For
the moment all machinations and intrigues are forgotten.
Each of them knows this fight will be remembered forever,
and each watches quietly.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — DAY 145

Hector lunges forward and from our angle it appears that he
has skewered Achilles. Hector's face is inches from Achilles.
Achilles appears unperturbed. Hector looks down.

Achilles has trapped him, allowing Hector's sword to miss
his side by inches and then clamping down on Hector's
sword arm. Hector tries to yank his sword free but
cannot.

Achilles stabs at Hector's face and Hector ducks at the
last moment, the sword point puncturing the air above his
head. Achilles releases Hector and takes another mighty
swing.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — CONTINUOUS 144

Andromache sits with Scamandrius, her back against the
wall. She cannot watch. Her boy, blissfully unaware,
coos happily and plays with his mother's long hair.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — CONTINUOUS 145

Achilles, sensing the advantage, moves in a step too
close.

Hector sees an opening and slashes. Achilles jumps back
at the last possible moment, but Hector's blade gouges out
a long strip of bronze from Achilles' breastplate.

Both men swing. Their swords lock and for a moment
everything is still. Achilles' face is inches from
Hector's. Hector is sweating and breathing heavily.
Achilles is not.

Achilles shoves Hector and relaunches his attack. While
Hector still fights ably, he's clearly tiring. As
Achilles' blows force Hector back, the prince steps on a
rock, trips, and falls. Achilles stands above him.

ACHILLES
Get up, prince of Troy. I won't
let a stone take my glory.

Hector stands. He knows his energy is fading fast. So he
spends everything on one last try. He charges, swinging
with explosive fury, putting all his might into each blow.

When the barrage is finished and Hector pauses for a
breath, he sees that Achilles, unhurt, has parried
everything. Now Achilles bores in, swinging. Hector
blocks and blocks, but doesn't have the stamina for a new
assault.

Achilles lunges. Hector raises his shield. The sword
plunges through the seven layers of oxhide, plunges
through the hammered bronze of the shield, the bronze of
the breastplate, all the way into Hector's heart.

Hector looks down at the blade. He looks at Achilles.
There is no mercy or remorse on the man's face.

Hector falls.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — CONTINUOUS 146

Priam reacts as if he received the blow, clutching at his
chest and reeling backward.

Paris presses forward, gripping the edge of the wall so
hard his knuckles turn white.

Andromache hears the GROANS of the crowd. She covers her

ears and clamps her eyes shut. Scamandrius stares at her,
baffled.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — CONTINUOUS 147

Hector lies on his back. Achilles pulls out his bloody
sword and walks to his chariot. Hector blinks. The sun,
now high in the sky, is blinding. Hector stares into the
sun and dies.

Silence. Silence everywhere. No victory cry from the
Greeks.

Achilles returns in the chariot. He jumps out with the
coil of rope. He ties Hector's ankles together, then ties
the other end of the rope to the back of the chariot.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — CONTINUOUS 148

Something hardens in Paris's face. Whatever callowness
we've seen before seems to ebb away as he watches Achilles
abuse Hector's body. Priam and his subjects watch in
horror.

PRIAM
My boy... my boy...

Andromache sits against the wall, knees tucked against her
chest, face against her knees. Scamandrius begins to cry.
Helen kneels by Andromache. She picks up the baby and
soothes him. Helen takes Andromache's hand. Andromache
looks up. Her eyes are a terrible thing to see.

HELEN
Let's go inside.

Andromache allows Helen to pull her to her feet. Helen,
holding the baby in one arm, guides Andromache away.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD — CONTINUOUS 149

Achilles whips his horse and the chariot starts rolling,
dragging Hector through the grass.

EXT. WALLS OF TROY — CONTINUOUS 150

Priam's legs give out. Glaucus and Paris catch him before
he falls and carry him toward the shade beneath the blue
canopy.

EXT. HIGH DUNES — DAY 151

Achilles rides his chariot over the crest of the dune.
The Greek army parts like the Red Sea, solemn and silent.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — DAY 152

Achilles rides into camp. The Greek soldiers gather round
to stare at Hector's body. Achilles doesn't look at
anyone. He unties the rope and hauls Hector by hand
across the sands.

Odysseus stands nearby, amongst the men. A few of the
soldiers laugh, seeing the Trojan prince laid low.

SOLDIER 1
He doesn't look so glorious now.

Odysseus turns and glares at the soldier, who shuts his
mouth. Odysseus walks away.

Achilles drags Hector's body to his tent, dumps him there,
and walks inside.

INT. ACHILLES' TENT — CONTINUOUS 155

Briseis kneels in the center of the tent, palms pressed
together, eyes lowered in prayer. She opens her eyes and
looks up when Achilles walks in.

He looks more beast than man, splattered with Hector's
blood. Briseis sees Achilles' face and knows what
happened. For the first time her strength deserts her.
She looks very young, very childlike as she begins to cry.

He regards her for a moment before going to his bedding
and lying on his back. We stay on his face as Briseis
weeps.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — NIGHT 154

All but the sentries are sleeping. No campfires burn as a
fat moon rises above the sea.

155

156

157

155.
INT. ACHILLES' TENT — NIGHT 155

Achilles, now clean, sits in the center of the tent,
sharpening his sword. Briseis sits in a far corner.
She's been crying for hours, her eyes red and swollen.

BRISEIS
You lost your cousin. And now
you've taken mine.

Achilles looks up at her.

BRISEIS
When does it end?

Achilles continues sharpening his sword.

ACHILLES
It never ends.

Briseis stares at him for a moment and leaves the tent.
Achilles quits his sharpening. Now there is nothing but
silence, nothing but a bronze sword for company.

EXT. TROJAN BEACH — NIGHT 156

Briseis sits on the beach, facing the moonlit sea.

INT. ACHILLES' TENT — NIGHT 157

Achilles still sits alone, his eyes empty. He hears a
rustling at the tent flap. An old man wearing a hooded
robe steps inside. The old man pulls his hood down. It's
Priam.

ACHILLES
Who are you?

Priam seems physically hurt by the sight of Achilles. For
a moment it seems he will collapse again.

But he wills himself onward, walking to Achilles' chair.
He sinks to his knees, takes Achilles' hands, and kisses
them. Achilles observes all this with curiosity.

PRIAM
I have endured what no one on earth
has endured before. I kissed the
hands of the man who killed my son.

ACHILLES
Priam?

(CONTINUED)

154.
157 CONTINUED: 157

Priam nods. Achilles stands, helping the old man to his
feet.

ACHILLES
How did you get in here, old king?
The sentries ——

PRIAM
I know my own country better than
the Greeks, I think.

ACHILLES
You're a brave man. If Agamemnon
knew you were here, he'd have your
head on a spit.

PRIAM
Do you really think death frightens
me now? I watched my eldest son
die, watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

Priam stares at Achilles, and for the first time since
we've known him, Achilles looks away.

PRIAM
Give him back to me. He deserves
the honor of a proper burial. You
know that. Give him to me.

ACHILLES
He killed my cousin.

PRIAM

He thought it was you. He defended
his country. How many cousins have
you killed? How many sons and
fathers and brothers and husbands?
How many, brave Achilles?

(beat)
I knew your father. He died before
his time. But he was lucky not to
live long enough to see his son
fall.

Achilles does not respond. We cannot read his expression.

(CONTINUED)

155.
CONTINUED: (2) 157

PRIAM

You've taken everything from me.
My eldest son, heir to my throne,
defender of my kingdom.

(beat)
I can't change what happened. It's
the will of the gods. But give me
this small mercy.

Achilles looks into the old man's eyes. Priam tries to
blink back his tears but fails.

PRIAM

I loved my boy from the moment he
opened his eyes till the moment you
closed them.

(beat)
Let me wash his body. Let me say
the prayers. Let me place two
coins on his eyes for the boatman.

ACHILLES
If I let you walk out of here, if I
let you take him, it doesn't change
anything. You're still my enemy in
the morning.

PRIAM
You're still my enemy tonight. But
even enemies can show respect.

Achilles nods.

ACHILLES
I admire your courage, old man.
You're a better king than the one
leading this army. Meet me outside
in a moment.

EXT. ACHILLES' TENT — MOMENTS LATER — NIGHT 158

Achilles, carrying a torch and a white shroud, walks to
the spot where Hector's body lies. He crouches beside the
dead prince. Death has not robbed Hector's face of its
dignity.

A small sand crab approaches the body and Achilles shoos

it away. He shoves the butt end of the torch into the
sand.

CONTINUED: 158

Achilles rubs his eyes with his hand and takes several
deep breaths. When he removes his hand, we see something
remarkable: Achilles' eyes are wet with tears.

For a moment he seems unsure what to do. Finally he
begins wrapping the white sheet around Hector's body.

ACHILLES
We'll meet again soon.

INT. ACHILLES' TENT — LATER — NIGHT 159

Priam, deep in his grief, sits with his head bowed. He
hears noiases outside. He stands and exits the tent.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — CONTINUOUS 160

Achilles gently loads Hector's body, now wrapped in the
shroud, onto a moonlit chariot. Priam walks to the
chariot.

Four Myrmidons, keeping a respectful distance, stand
guard.

ACHILLES
Your son was the best I've fought.
I want you to know that.
(beat)
In my country the funeral games
last twelve days.

PRIAM
It's the same in my country.

ACHILLES
Then no Greek will attack Troy for
twelve days. The prince deserves
that honor.

Achilles, hearing footsteps, turns. Briseis emerges from
the shadows. Priam is stunned.

PRIAM
Briseis?

Priam wraps his arms around her, thrilled she's alive.
PRIAM

We thought you were dead, little
swan.

(CONTINUED)

161

157.
CONTINUED: 160

After a moment Briseis turns and looks at Achilles.
Nobody speaks for a long beat. Tears shine in Briseis'
eyes.

ACHILLES
You'll be safe behind the Trojan
walls.

Achilles reaches into his tunic and pulls out the SHELL
NECKLACE that Patroclus had worn. He fastens it around
her delicate neck, where the purple bruises are still
visible. He speaks quietly to her, too softly for Priam
to hear.

ACHILLES
If I hurt you —— it's not what I
wanted.
(long beat)
You gave me one night of peace in a
lifetime of war.

She stares up at him, her young face mapped with
conflicting emotions. Finally, Achilles turns to Priam.

ACHILLES
Go. No one will stop you, you have
my word.

Priam gets in the chariot. Briseis still looks at
Achilles.

PRIAM
Come, my girl.

Priam reaches down and helps her onto the chariot. He
seizes the reins and they're off, the Myrmidons escorting
them to safety. Achilles stares at Briseis until she's
gone.

INT. AGAMEMNON'S TENT — DAY 161

Agamemnon paces about his tent in a murderous fury.
Odysseus, Nestor and several AIDES stand in attendance.

AGAMEMNON
(shouting)
Achilles makes a secret pact and I
have to honor it?! What treason is
this?

AGAMEMNON (CONT'D)

(fairly spitting

the words)
Consorting with the enemy king!
Giving him twelve days of peace.
Peace! Their prince is dead; their
army is leaderless. This is the
time to attack!

NESTOR
Even with Hector gone, we have no
way to breach their walls. They
can wait ten years for us to leave.

AGAMEMNON
I will smash their walls to the ground. If it costs me
forty thousand Greeks, Zeus hear me, I will smash their
walls to the ground.
Nestor and Odysseus exchange troubled glances.

EXT. CAMPFIRE — DAY 162
Odysseus sits with his ITHACANS by the fire. The men eat

a breakfast of grilled fish. The soldier sitting beside
Odysseus whittles with a sharp knife.

Odysseus watches the man work. The Soldier notices his

king's attention. He smiles and holds up a small WOOD
HORSE.

SOLDIER
For my boy back home.

Odysseus nods, never taking his eyes off the toy horse.

EXT. AGAMEMNON'S TENT — DAY 165

Hundreds of Greeks eat breakfast on the beach. Several of
them turn to watch Odysseus, who rushes to Agamemnon's
tent and disappears inside.

EXT. MAIN SQUARE OF TROY — NIGHT 164
A giant pyre has been built in the city square. Thousands
of CITIZENS are gathered around to watch. No crowd has

ever been more silent. The city has lost its favorite

SOl’l.

(CONTINUED)

164

165

159.
CONTINUED: 164

Hector lies atop the pyre, dressed in a woven robe of
white and gold, his hair washed and oiled, his skin
gleaming and clean. His face is undamaged. Two coins
rest above his eyes.

Priam stands at the base of the pyre, holding a lit torch.
His hand trembles. He is unable to light the pyre.

Finally Paris grips his father's shoulder. Paris takes
the torch from Priam and lights the kindling.

Helen, Andromache, and baby Scamandrius sit nearby.
Andromache's face is completely blank. She stares dully
at the quickening fire. Helen holds Scamandrius in her
lap. The boy plays with the WOOD LION his father made for
him.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — NIGHT 165

By torchlight, we see Greeks stripping planks from two
burnt shells of warships. Others pry spikes out of the
fortifications.

Odysseus watches the men carry the planks and bundles of
spikes to an ever—growing pile. Achilles approaches him.

ACHILLES
Wily Odysseus. You've found a way
to make the sheep invite the wolves
over for dinner.

ODYSSEUS
This is war.

ACHILLES
Agamemnon will kill them all. Men,
women, children —— all of them.

You know that.
Achilles walks away. Odysseus follows him.

ODYSSEUS
I'm the king of Ithaca, not Troy.
My loyalty is to Ithaca. If this
plan works, the war ends in a
night. And my men can sail home to
their wives.

Achilles keeps walking, Odysseus pacing after him.

CONTINUED: 165

ODYSSEUS
It's not Troy you're worried about,
is it? It's one Trojan. One Trojan
girl.

Achilles halts. He stares at Odysseus for a long count.

ACHILLES
I've always liked you. But if that
girl dies because of your plan, you
will never sail home to your wife.

Achilles turns and leaves. Odysseus takes a deep breath.

EXT. ACHILLES' TENT — LATER 166

Achilles arrives at his tent and finds Eudorus polishing
his armor. Eudorus jumps to his feet.

ACHILLES
Eudorus.
(beat)
Forgive me.

Eudorus blinks. No one has ever heard these words from
Achilles' mouth before.

ACHILLES
I should never have struck you.
You've been a loyal friend all your

life.

EUDORUS
I hope I never disappoint you
again.

ACHILLES
Rouse the men. You're taking them
home.

EUDORUS

Aren't you coming with us?

ACHILLES
I've got one more battle to fight.

Eudorus hesitates, watching his lord. Finally:
EUDORUS
She's worth fighting for. We'll

march behind you.

ACHILLES
All that's left is the slaughter.
I don't want to see my men fouled
with children's blood.
(beat)
Go, Eudorus. This is the last
order I give you.

After a long pause, Eudorus bows deeply to his commander.

EUDORUS
Fighting for you has been my life's
honor.

Achilles grips his lieutenant's shoulder and strides away.

EXT. GUARD TOWER — DAWN 167

Twelve days later.
The SENTRIES are at their posts, warming their hands over
a brazier. The sky begins to lighten.

Sentry 1 stares down to the sea. He hurries to the edge
of the tower and squints into the morning fog. Sentry 2
looks at him and then joins him.

SENTRY 1
They're gone.

It's true. All the Greek ships are gone from the beach.
All the tents have been struck, all the chariots taken
away, every last man —— gone.

Nothing's left on the beach but a strange wooden
structure.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — DAY 168

Priam, Paris, Glaucus, Archeptolemus, and Velior, all on
horseback, lead the Apollonian Guard onto the beach. The
soldiers —— still wary of an ambush —— surround their

leaders, protecting them from attack. The Trojan leaders
dismount.

Slowly they approach a WOODEN HORSE standing forty feet
high.

(CONTINUED)

168

142.
CONTINUED: 168

The beach is deserted save for the bones of burnt—out
ships, a few stray arrows, the remnants of the camp fires,
and corpses —— dozens of Greek bodies scattered in the
sands.

Each of the cadavers is covered with large black sores.
The Trojans inspect the bodies, keeping a wary distance.

PRIAM
Plague.

GLAUCUS
Don't get too close, my king.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
This is the will of the gods.

Everyone turns to look at the high priest.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
They desecrated the temple of Apollo and Apollo desecrated
their flesh. The Greeks could fight our swords and
arrows, but they can't fight the god's plague.
Glaucus shakes his head and laughs.

GLAUCUS
They thought they'd come here and
sack our city in a day. And look
at them now, fleeing across the
Aegean.

Priam stares up at the great horse.

PRIAM
What is this?

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
An offering to Poseidon. The
Greeks are praying for a safe
return home.

GLAUCUS
I hope the Sea God spits on their
offering and lets them all drown at
the bottom of the sea.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
This is a gift. We should bring it
to the temple of Poseidon.

All the men stare at the towering horse.

PARIS
I think we should burn it.
VELIOR
Burn it? My prince —— it's a gift
to the gods.
GLAUCUS

The prince is right. I'd burn all
of Greece if I had a big enough
torch.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
I warn you, good men. Be careful
what you insult. Our beloved
prince Hector had sharp words for
the gods and a day later Achilles'
sword cut him down.

Priam turns to look at the high priest.

PARIS
(glaring at
Archeptolemus)
Burn it, father.

Archeptolemus ignores Paris and speaks directly to Priam.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
Forgive me, my king. I mean no
disrespect. But I don't want to
see any more princes of Troy incur
the gods' wrath.

All the men look at Priam. He stares at the massive
horse.

PRIAM
I will not watch another son die.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD — DAY 169

Dozens of Trojan soldiers tugging long ropes pull the
massive horse across the grassy plain.

EXT. GATES OF TROY — DAY 170

The soldiers drag the horse through the gates. The
citizens of Troy watch from atop the walls and inside the
city proper.

144.
EXT. MAIN SQUARE OF TROY — DAY 171

The horse now stands near the statue of Poseidon wielding
his trident, beside his temple on one corner of the city
square.

The square is crowded and jubilant. Soldiers and citizens
celebrate their great victory, drinking wine in the
streets, waving torches and Trojan flags, singing songs.

Paris and Helen sit on the palace stairs, watching the
crowd.

PARIS
Look at them. You'd think their
prince had never died.

Helen takes his hand.

HELEN
You're their prince.
(beat)
Make your brother proud.

Her comment echoes the words Hector spoke to him before
his death. Paris nods solemnly. Helen rests her head on
his shoulder. They sit quietly as the crowds sing in the
street.

EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT — DUSK 172

An abandoned DOG lopes along the beach, stopping to sniff
each Greek corpse. Finding one dead man he seems to
recognize, the dog licks the cadaver's face.

The "sore" on the dead face is licked clean. The sores
are masterful forgeries, applied with squid ink and dried
blood.

EXT. CLIFFS OF HELLESPONT — NIGHT 175

A TROJAN RIDER on horseback trots south, away from distant
Troy. He looks toward the Hellespont. Something catches
his eye. He frowns and guides his mount toward the
cliff's edge.

We rise above him and look down at the Hellespont. By the
light of the moon, nearly one thousand GREEK WARSHIPS
harbor in the deserted bay.

The rider stares at the ships in horror.

EXT. MAIN SQUARE OF TROY — NIGHT 174

The square is empty now, all the revelers gone home. The
wood horse waits in the moonlight. We witness something
strange: ropes, anchored inside the horse, fall to the
ground.

Soldiers emerge from the horse and slide silently down the
ropes: Achilles, Odysseus and ten other Greek soldiers.
None of them wear the bright, clanking bronze armor.

Their swords and spears are wrapped in lambskins.

Odysseus leads a team of Ithacans across the square.
Quiet as shadows, they creep up on the sentries guarding
the main gate. Another team moves toward the guard
towers.

Achilles stands alone in the dark square, watching his
compatriots set off on their deadly missions. Finally he
turns and moves in the opposite direction, toward the
palace. He's on a different mission.

EXT. CITY GATES 174A

Two Ithacans cut the gate sentries' throats. The soldiers
begin pulling the chains to raise the city gates.

THE TROJAN RIDER 174B

gallops to Troy. The Greeks see him coming and look to
Odysseus for guidance. The rider, still at some distance,
shouts to the men at the gates.

TROJAN RIDER
They're still here! The Greeks are
still here! They sailed up the
Hellespont!

Odysseus hurls his spear. It flies through the bars of
the gate and into the rider's throat, knocking him from
his horse. The horse, panicked, gallops away.

EXT. GUARD TOWER — CONTINUOUS 175

One of the sentries, hearing the commotion, wakes up.
Groggy, he looks over the edge of the tower —— into a
Greek's face. The Greek, one hand on the ladder, stabs
the sentry. Another Greek crawls into the tower and kills
the second sentry.

EXT. GATES OF TROY — CONTINUOUS 176

The Greeks pull the gates open. They wave their torches,
a signal. Looking into the distance, we see something
shifting in the darkness, coming closer and closer.

The Greek army, shadows in the dark, charges toward the
city at a sprint, silent. Thousands upon thousands of
warriors running quietly as panthers.

Like water bursting through a dam, the Greeks blast
through the gates, swords and spears raised.

EXT. PALACE OF TROY — NIGHT 177

Briseis leans against a balustrade, staring toward the
beach. She wears a blue robe and the seashell necklace.
She hears NOISES from the city gates and turns. On a
flagpole above the highest guard tower, the Trojan flag is
burning.

EXT. TROY — NIGHT 178

All over the city, the Greeks carry out their raids,
killing sentries at their posts, setting buildings on fire
with torches, opening the stable doors and shooing all the
frightened horses into the streets.

NEW ANGLE 178A
Soon the city is in chaos. Fires burn out of control.
Screams begin to echo down the alleyways, first just a

few, then more and more, until it seems the entire city is
screaming.

ACHILLES 178B

runs through the burning city, keeping to the shadows.

INT. PRIAM'S MEETING HALL — NIGHT 179

Priam stands on the balcony, watching his beautiful city
burn, watching the destruction of his life's work.

EXT. TROJAN ARMORY — NIGHT 180

Trojan soldiers begin to straggle in, but they're not
prepared for this. Many are unarmed and all look
terrified. Four Trojans run to the armory doors and throw
them open.

They dive back as a BLAST of heat rushes out the door.
The armory is aflame, fires eating at the wood—beamed
ceiling, devouring thousands of spears on their racks.

EXT. TROJAN STREETS — NIGHT 181

FAMILIES of terrified civilians stagger through the
streets in their bedclothes. MOTHERS clutch their
CHILDREN's hands. OLD WOMEN flee their burning buildings.

The women scream when they see Achilles running toward
them, sword drawn. But pillaging is the last thing on his
mind.

INT. PALACE HALLWAYS — NIGHT 182

Briseis hurries through the hallways. Outside, past the
archways, the white buildings of Troy are on fire. We
hear the screaming of a dying city.

EXT. MAIN SQUARE OF TROY — NIGHT 185

Agamemnon stands in the very center of Troy, head tilted
back, watching with delight as the beautiful city burns.

AGAMEMNON
I promised you, brother.
(yelling to
his troops)
Burn it all!

INT. PARIS'S BEDCHAMBER — NIGHT 184

Paris suits up for battle. He grabs his bow and quiver of
arrows. Helen watches him. Andromache enters the room,
Scamandrius in her arms.

ANDROMACHE
We have to run.

HELEN
Where?

ANDROMACHE
I'll show you.

Paris looks at Helen.

HELEN
Come, my love. Come with us.

EXT. STREETS OF TROY — NIGHT 185
Odysseus battles his way down the street, leading the

Greeks against a contingent of half—armored Trojans. The
Trojans are too dazed to offer much resistance.

EXT. PALACE GARDEN — NIGHT 186

Andromache, carrying her baby and a lit torch, leads
Helen, Paris, and other WOMEN and CHILDREN down the
staircase to the vine—tangled door. Andromache pulls it
open.

INT. PALACE OF TROY — SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL — NIGHT 187

Andromache leads the Trojans to the bronze—banded door.
She opens the door, revealing the dark tunnel.

ANDROMACHE
It's a long walk.

Helen and the others enter the tunnel. Paris does not.
He stands just outside the door.

PARIS
I stay.

HELEN
No ——

PARIS

My father will never abandon the
city. I can't leave him.

HELEN
The city is dead! They're burning
it to the ground!

Paris looks at the huddled refugees. They're a timid lot,
terrified and weak. AENEAS (14) looks stronger and braver
than the rest. He's supporting his ELDERLY FATHER.

PARIS
What's your name?

AENEAS
Aeneas.

PARIS

Do you know how to use a sword?
Aeneas nods. Paris pulls out the sword of Troy.

As long as it's in a Trojan's hand,
our people have a future.

(hands sword

to Aeneas)
Protect them, Aeneas. Find them a
new home.

AENEAS
I will.

Andromache touches Paris's arm.

ANDROMACHE
Briseis wasn't in her room.

PARIS
I'll find her.

Andromache kisses him. She turns and leads the way

through the tunnel. The Trojans follow. Aeneas bows to

Paris and

helps his father as their long journey begins.

HELEN
I'll stay with you.

Paris pushes her gently toward the door.

PARIS
Go.
HELEN
Don't leave me. Please don't leave
me.
PARIS
How could you love me if I ran now?
HELEN
Please ——
PARIS

We will be together again. In this
world or the next, we will be
together.

He kisses her hard, pushes her through the door and closes

it. He kisses the wood, turns and runs toward the battle.

INT. PALACE OF TROY — NIGHT 188

Briseis runs down a long corridor. We hear cries from the
massacre outside.

BRISEIS
Paris? Andromache?

She stops mid—stride. A riderless WHITE HORSE rounds the
corner and bolts toward her, eyes crazed, muzzled foamed
with spittle. Briseis backs against the wall. The
terrified horse gallops past her.

EXT. PALACE OF TROY — NIGHT 189

ACHILLES
BRISEIS! BRISEIS!

Achilles scales the high wall surrounding the palace and
jumps to the other side. He's spotted by an Apollonian.

The Guard charges. Achilles cracks him in the face with
the hilt of his sword. The Guard falls. Achilles grabs
him and hauls him to his feet, sword at his throat.

ACHILLES
Briseis —— where is she?
(louder)
Where is she?!

APOLLONIAN #2
I don't know... please, I have a
son.

Achilles shoves him away.

ACHILLES
Get him out of Troy.

The Guard, stunned to find himself alive, finally runs.
Achilles rushes into the palace.

EXT. PALACE STAIRS — NIGHT 190

Odysseus and his men fight their way up the palace stairs.
The Trojans resist heroically. They die heroically.
Agamemnon stands behind his troops, hollering orders.

AGAMEMNON
No one escapes! No one!

INT. PALACE — RECEPTION HALL — NIGHT 191

Outside we hear the screams and battle cries. Glaucus
stands with fifty of his men, the last line of defense.
He walks through their ranks, clasping hands with each
man.

GLAUCUS
You men are soldiers. Leading you
has been an honor.

Paris runs into the hall. Glaucus smiles and clasps hands
with the prince. Glaucus addresses the men.

GLAUCUS
The boatman is waiting for us. I
say, let him wait a little longer!

The men roar as the Greeks spill into the reception hall.

THE TROJANS 191A

attack. For a few moments they drive the Greeks back.
Paris notches an arrow and fires. A Greek falls, an arrow
through his throat.

But too many Greeks pour through the doors. The Trojans
fight bravely, especially Paris, who fires quickly and
accurately.

Odysseus engages Glaucus and quickly kills the old
general. The surviving Trojans retreat farther into the
palace.

INT. MEETING HALL — NIGHT 192

Dozens of Greeks charge into the hall, seizing whatever
treasures they can carry and smashing whatever they can't.

Priam, armed with a sword, rushes into the hall. He sees

two Greeks grabbing small GOLD FIGURINES of the gods from
their wall sconces.

He raises his sword.
PRIAM
Have you no honor? No respect for
the gods?

CONTINUED: 192

Before Priam can move forward he is speared from behind,
the spearhead tearing through his back and out his chest.
He falls. Agamemnon stands above him. He yanks his spear
free.

AGAMEMNON
I wanted you alive, old king. I
wanted you to watch your city burn.

PRIAM
Please... the children... spare the
innocents...

AGAMEMNON

Let Hades decide who's innocent.

He walks away, leaving the old man to die alone on the
floor.

INT. SHRINE OF ZEUS — NIGHT 195

Archeptolemus kneels beneath the statue of Zeus. He
stands when a band of Greek soldiers close in on him.

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
Beware, my friends. I am a servant
of the gods.

A soldier chops him down and hurls the priest's body over
the balustrade.
EXT. PALACE GARDEN — NIGHT 194

Briseis runs into the garden, looking for a friendly face.
No one's in sight. She runs to the lower garden.

She doesn't notice Agamemnon, stained with Priam's blood,
standing in an archway of the burning palace, watching
her.

INT. PALACE HALLWAYS — NIGHT 195
Achilles races through the palace, ignoring the fire and
smoke, searching the faces of the terrified women he

passes.

ACHILLES
Briseis! Briseis!

EXT. PALACE GARDEN — NIGHT 196

Briseis kneels by Apollo's statue, ignoring the inferno
around her.

AGAMEMNON (O.S.)
Too late for prayer, priestess.

Briseis does not look up. Agamemnon grabs her long hair
and pulls her to her feet. He holds his sword to her
throat. Two of his BODYGUARDS stand behind him.

AGAMEMNON
Your parents should have taught you
to stand for a king.

BRISEIS
They did.

AGAMEMNON
You wore a white robe when I last
saw you. No more? Did brave
Achilles ruin you for the temple?

Briseis does not look at him or answer. He pulls her
close.
AGAMEMNON
I almost lost this war because of
your little romance. I want to
taste what Achilles tasted.

INT. PALACE — NIGHT 197

Achilles, running past the bodies of dead Trojans, looks
through an archway and sees Briseis in Agamemnon's hands.
He dashes outside.

EXT. PALACE GARDEN — NIGHT 198

AGAMEMNON
(whispering in
Briseis' ear)
You'll be my slave in Mycenae. A
Trojan priestess scrubbing my
floors. And at night ——

He tears her robe. Briseis pulls her hand out of her
sleeve. She's holding a ceremonial DAGGER.

She drives the dagger into the side of Agamemnon's neck.
His eyes bulge. She rams the dagger deeper. Agamemnon
falls to the ground, clutching at his neck.

CONTINUED: 198

The bodyguards stare at their dying king in disbelief.
Briseis runs. The bodyguards pursue her.

Briseis stumbles and falls. She looks behind her. One of
the bodyguards raises his sword, ready to split Briseis in
half.

Before he can bring down his sword, his head flies from
his shoulders. As the man falls, Achilles whirls around
and dispatches the other bodyguard, bronze sword
glittering in the moonlight.

INT. PALACE — CONTINUOUS 199

Paris, bow in hand, looks out an archway to the garden and
sees Achilles —— the man who killed his brother ——
splattered with blood, sword in hand, standing over
Briseis.

EXT. PALACE GARDEN — CONTINUOUS 200

Achilles looks down at Agamemnon's corpse, lying in
puddled blood a few feet away. He looks back to Briseis.

ACHILLES
Come with me.

Before she can answer her eyes go wide. She sees Paris,
in the upper garden, notching an arrow.

ACHILLES
Come. I'll protect you.

Paris pulls back the catgut string. Briseis screams:

BRISEIS
No!

Paris fires. Briseis's scream distracts him —— the arrow
sails off course, hitting Achilles above his heel, tearing
through the tendon. Achilles staggers, turns, and sees
Paris.

Achilles snarls and heads for him. Paris shoots again.
Achilles tries to dodge but the torn tendon in his heel
slows him down. The arrow rips through his side.
Achilles keeps limping forward.

BRISEIS
Stop! Paris! Stop!

(CONTINUED)

155.
200 CONTINUED:

Paris releases another arrow. Now Achilles doesn't even
try to dodge. The arrow sinks deep into his chest.

Achilles keeps coming. He knows this is the end. A small
smile crosses his face. He has waited for this moment his
entire life. He marches toward his destiny.

Paris notches another arrow. His hands are shaking but he
fires again. This one drills deep into Achilles' belly.

BRISEIS
Stop!

Achilles keeps coming. Paris reaches for another arrow.
His quiver is empty. Aeneas has his sword.

The palace around them is burning, lighting their faces.
Blood pours from Achilles' wounds. The arrow shafts stick
out of him. Any other man would have already fallen. But
he keeps coming, relentless, his face a mask of grim
purpose.

Briseis runs in front of her cousin Paris and shields him
with her body. Achilles lifts his bloody sword.

BRISEIS
No more.

Briseis does not move. For several seconds the great
warrior and the young girl stare at each other.

BRISEIS
No more killing.

Achilles looks at the seashell necklace she wears.

BRISEIS
No more.

Achilles raises his sword and brings it down hard, burying
its bronze blade in the soil of the garden.

ACHILLES
No more.

He reaches out and rubs the shells of her necklace.

ACHILLES
My mother made this necklace.

(CONTINUED)

200 CONTINUED: (2) 200

He sinks to a sitting position on the grass. He pulls the
arrows out of his body and tosses them aside. Briseis
sits beside him. She cradles his head in her arms while
all Troy burns around them.

ACHILLES
You have to get out.

BRISEIS
Shh.

ACHILLES
Get out.

She kisses his lips, running her fingers across his jaw.

BRISEIS
There's no way out.

Achilles stares at Paris.

ACHILLES
There's always a way out for the
princes.

Paris tries to lift Briseis to her feet but she refuses.

ACHILLES
Briseis.

She leans closer. He's losing too much blood, his
strength is fading, but he summons his remaining energy to
speak.

ACHILLES
I chose this night... but you will
see the sun again. I want you to
live.

Her face is full of sorrow and love. He touches her lips,
his fingers trembling as his body fails. She kisses him.

ACHILLES
Live.

She doesn't want to go but he pushes her gently away.
Finally she nods.

BRISEIS
Because of you.

(CONTINUED)

She turns and follows Paris down the stairs toward escape.
Achilles watches her intently until he sees she's safely
away. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.

Hordes of rampaging Greeks storm the garden, burning
anything that will burn, hollering their victory cries.

Achilles sits alone in the garden. He shivers, hugging
himself for warmth, waiting.

EXT. MAIN SQUARE OF TROY — DAWN 201

The Greeks are victorious. The beautiful city of Troy is
a ruin. Trojan PRISONERS are led off in chains. Greek
soldiers carry gold treasures from the lavish temples and
palace.

Funeral pyres fill the square. One pyre, taller than the
rest, rises in the center of the square. Odysseus stands
atop the highest pyre, staring down at the body of
Achilles.

For a long time Odysseus looks at the dead man's face. He
knows the world will never see another Achilles. Finally
he reaches inside his tunic, pulls out two coins, and
places them over Achilles' eyes.

ODYSSEUS
Find peace, my brother.

Odysseus climbs down from the pyre. A LIEUTENANT hands

him a torch and Odysseus starts the fire. The dry wood

quickly catches. Black smokes rises toward the circling
crows.

CLOSE on Odysseus as he watches his friend burn.

EXT. SCAMANDER RIVER — DAWN 202
A small band of Trojans marches east toward the rising

sun. Helen and Paris, Andromache and Scamandrius, Aeneas
and the others —— alive. They walk toward Mount Ida.

Briseis walks behind the others. She stops for a moment
and looks back toward the ruins of Troy.

(CONTINUED)

158.
CONTINUED: 202

CLOSE on Briseis for a beat. And then we see what she
sees: the black smoke from Achilles' pyre rising above
the smoldering city, rising above the circling crows, and
finally fading away into the deep blue sky.

FADE OUT.

THE END
