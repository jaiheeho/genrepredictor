"THE SPIRIT or ST. LOUIS" 1/8/57
FINAL

FADE IN
PLANE IN THE SKY DAY

Fleecy clouds in the b.g. The credit titles appear over
this while the tiny plane flies steadily in the distant sky.
At the end of the main title credits a DISSOLVE brings in a
LEGEND against the same b.g.:

In 1927
a young man, alone in a single engine
airplane, flew non-stop from Roosevelt
Field in New York across the entire
North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field
in Paris, a distance of three thousand
six hundred and ten miles.

In this triumph of mind, body and
spirit, Charles A..Lindbergh influenced
the lives of everyone on earth -- for in the
33 hours and 30 minutes of his flight the
air age became a reality.

This is the story of that flight.
' DISsOLVE T0:

EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK NIGHT

The street lamps are shrouded in rain. The pavement is wet.
Several autos of the 1920's stand in front of the sprawling:
building. A sign in the f.g. reads GARDEN CITY HOTEL, LONG
ISLAND, Light gleams from the lobby door and windows. The
upper stories are dotted with a few lights behind drawn
shades.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY NIGHT

A thin mist of cigarette smoke hovers over the\room. Some of
the easy chairs and sofas are occupied by dozing reporters.
At a coffee table a sob sister is busily typing. Telephone
booths are busy. The switchboard buzzes. There is the clack
of many typewriters.

ing against any disturbance. ,The whole world is
waiting breathlessly to learn the outcome --—"

6. INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR NIGHT

The sound of the typewriters filters up into the dim corridor.
At one end a red fire exit globe shines. A shaft of yellow
comes from an open transom. Mahoney sits on a chair in front
of the deer to Room 106. »

‘ =j . Suddenly from a tinny phonograph the chorus of RIC RITA blarss _j

in. The phonograph stops. He closes the door, returns to his
chair in front of Room 106. 'Then, on second thought, he
gently turns the doorknob and looks into 106.

stay alive? The company oughta get you some real

16. SNOWSTORM ' ' NIGHT

Lindbergh is flying the mail plane in blinding snow. The en-
gine coughs. -He turns his flashlight on the gas gauge. It
wavers on Empty. He slips the flashlight in his pocket, holds
the stick between his knees and unbuckles the safety belt.

The engine coughs again, then spits a couple or times and dies.
Ngw there is only the sound of the wind whining through the
s ru 3.

Lindbergh site up on the side of the cockpit and rolls oTT
into space. The ship glides on for a moment, then.ncses;
down, the whine rising to a scream.
Lindbergh is swinging under his parachute, his flashlight
earthward, hoping to get a glimpse of what might be in store
for him below. There is the faint sound of the wind screaming
through the struts or the falling plane ~ coming .nearer and ‘
nearer.

Lindbergh looks up. He sweeps his flashlight around the snowy
sky. The scream of the plane is louder. Suddenly the wing
lights appear. The plane comes banking out of the snow,circlee
past him with inches to spare. The sound recedes, then grows
louder again — again it comes careening toward the parachute.
Lindbergh seizes the shroud lines and pulls.-The chute slips
down and away Just as the-wild plane is about to stick its
nose in the silk. The plane spirals away again - then close
again - makes another pass - then crashes somewhere below.

Lindbergh floats on down, swinging in the icy wind.

A coach rocking through the winter night. The straight-
backed dark green seats are well occupied. Lindbergh,
carrying the limp mail sacks, enters the car, moves down
the aisle searching for a seat. Heads turn to watch him.
He looks out of place in his flying suit and helmet. He
slides into a seat beside a man who is reading a-newspaper.
The man is about fifty, wears a derby hat, a high stiff
collar, a neat black suit and tie. Lindbergh, conscious of
the attention he's getting, removes the helmet and fumbles
it into his pocket.

The man sitting next to him — his name is Schultz - inspects
him with a Jaundiced eye.

SCHULTZ:

LINDBERGH:
Yes, sir. '
SCHULTZ:

They got to fall down. Nothing to hold them up.

Ii. ' Just a few hangars. No runways. A couple of 13.5. Airmail

Deﬁavilands rocking in the icy wind. Several other biplanes
on the field. A sparse crew handling the shoestring opera-
tion. - .

A shabby Model T Ford, top up, side-curtains flapping, has
driven up to Louie's Shack - a makeshift diner for the ex-
ecutives, mechanics and pilots on Lambert Field. Lindbergh
gets out of the Ford. He is in his pilot's breaches, leather
jacket with a sweater underneath.

19. INT. LOUIE'S SHACK . DAY

It’s all very primitive. A wooden counter, six stools. A
wall phone on one of the rough pine walls. On a shelf beside
the phone a fish bowl with some coins in it and a sign read-
ing CALLS FIVE CENTS. Tacked on the other side of the phone
a map of the eastern half-of the United States. There are
snapshots of pilots and planes. A radio with a loud-speaker
horn plays BABY FACE.

Louie is-pouring hot water into the coffee urn. Jesse, the
colored cook, is scraping the grease off the hamburger
griddle, mumbling a seat accompaniment to BABY FACE.

 

Lindbergh enters the shack.

he puts his thumb on St. Louis and spans the hand until the
tip of his pinky reaches New York.

LINDBERGH:
As a matter of fact, it'll fly much farther than
that. If I. strip it of everything, add extra tanks

INT. STATE NATIONAL BANK . DAY

It is bustling with activity. The marble pillars, marble
floor, the Victorian grills in the tellers' windows breathe
of conservatism.

Lindbergh enters the bank. He is wearing shiny blue serge
pants,- leather jacket, sweater, khaki shirt and dark tie. He
checks his wrist watch against the big clock. It is 11:00
AM. He sits on a bench to wait. Knight comes out of a

nearby room, greets him.

KNIGHT:
Slim!

Lindbergh looks arOund. In the open door leading to the ex-
ecutive office stands Harry Knight beckoning Lindbergh in.
Knight is a stocky, energetic young man - not much older than
Lindbergh. Lindbergh gets up apprehensively, crosses toward
Knight. Knight ushers him into the executive office. '

INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE DAY

If the business floor of the bank impressed you with its
sober solidity, this office has got it in spades. Dark
mahogany paneling, dignified carpeting, deep leather chairs.

Behind the broad desk sits Harold Bixby - an authOritative
man in his forties, with a black moustache, penetrating
brown eyes, and a carnation in the lapel of his well-cut

the instrument panel, pushes up the goggles, rubs his eyes.

_ DISSOLVE TO:

BROOKS FIELD ' . DAY

Four shining army planes and twenty shining cadets are lined
up smartly for inspection. Captain Coleman — the antiseptic
disciplinarian - is giving the outfit a thorough going over.
He walks down the line, followed by an adjutant. First he

'runs his white-gloved hand over the top of a wing, checking

for dust. It's spotless. Next he disapproves of the angle
of the propeller. All the other planes have their propellers
straight up and down. This one is slightly cocked to one
side. He shoots a dirty look at the Cadet in charge of the
plane. The Cadet nudges the prop into line.

That‘s good enough for Captain Coleman. He moves on to the
next plane, ducks-under it, inspects the under—belly of the
engine. A drop of black oil falls on his nose. He freezes -
atraightens up slowly - then confronts the Cadet Leader of
the leaky plane - no shouting, mind you - more cat and mouse.

CAPTAIN: =

(working himself up to that stroke)
All right, men — I'll give it to you again: Some
of you seem to think that these airplanes are
garbage cans. When you joined this here army air
service you married these planes: Now take care
of them: Love ‘em, scrub 'em, shine 'em, keep 'em
in shape: A dirty airplane makes for a sloppy
pilot: And I'm not gonna have any sloppy pilots
graduating from this here.fie1d£

During this harangue the SOUND of an approaching plane has
become increasingly.louder. The Captain does not like to be
drowned out. He looks up angrily.

Circling over the field is Lindbergh's Jenny. It's in pitiful
shape. The engine knocks and spits. The fuselage cloth is
patched all over - the struts held together with baling wire
and splints. The lettering (SLIM'S SPECTACULAR SKY-RIDES -

Lindbergh gets ready for a landing. He doesn't look much
better than his plane - his greasy helmet coming apart at

the seams, his goggles awry.on the top of his head.

fights to get the plane up.

LINDBERGH:
Come on now, climb outa this stuff before we get

Lindbergh watches the altimeter - nine hundred feet — eight

The ice on the wing gets thicker — obliterating the registra-

The altimeter is on seven hundred new.
LINDBERGH:
You're stalling, you're stalling! Now turn around,

He banks the plane around. For the first time since he left
Long Island, the Spirit now flies west - from right to left--

-and losing altitude all the time.

The altimeter shows five hundred feet.
Lindbergh works hard to maintain altitude.

Below he sees the raging sea whipped up by the wind -- and
ahead an opening in the icy clouds.

He swings the plane, tries to get through - before it's too
late - --or is it too late already - - 7 ’

The Spndt bursts out of the ice storm into the moonlight.

There it is, ice smothering the carburetor. Burn
it out. Backfire it out. Blast the guts out of it.

Working furiously at the controls, Lindbergh guns the motor
into a series of shattering backfires and it picks up again.
But the Spirit is still dropping under its heavy load of ice.
We see the altimeter needle moving inexorably down toward
zero. Lindbergh rocks the plane desperately, trying to shake
off the ice, but it holds.

of sound, moves in close, the instrument dials looming large -
then falls away, throbs in close again. Lindbergh shakes his
head like a punch-drunk fighter. He takes cotton from his '

siren's song, a monotonous musical note in its measured ebb

the control stick, falls off to dangle between his legs.
Under his feet the pedals move without aid.

The Spirit flies steadily on for awhile, the control stick
bobbing a little. Very gradually the nose of the plane drops
below the horizon, the wings tilt. . u _

Lindbergh rolls slightly, does not awaken.

The drone of the engine takes on a faster tempo, wind through
the struts rises to a whistle - the Spirit glides down in an
ever tightening spiral, doing an odd sort of ballet in its
descent - leveling for a moment sideslipping into the spiral

a shaft of sunlight creeps through the opening gulf, catches

sunlight touches the compass mirror, reflects a dazzling sun-
beam against Lindbergh's closed eyes - snaps on and off as if
a hand were opening and closing a switch.

of light and dark - finally halts - the propeller dies.

In the cockpit Lindbergh Sits hunched forward, his hand on
the ignition — then he falls back into the seat, exhausted,
his face bathed in.sweat. a

INT. PLANE

Far away in his consciousness he hears the'faint cry of many
voices - He turns his head to look out of the window.

Thousands of people are running across the field toward the
plane. They flood around the plane - tear open the cockpit
door - drag Lindbergh out and carry him on their shoulders.

Lindbergh looks back toward his plane and sees part of the
crowd swarming all over it. He looks around wildly for
help, spots a gendarme struggling to stand upright in the
swirling throng.

- LINDBERGH:
(pointing back to the plane)
No! No: They're tearing up my airplane!

GENDARME:
(grinning and gesticulating
reassuringly up at Lindbergh)
Non, non, non. They are taking it to the

There is nothing to be done anyway, for Lindbergh is being
carried away as on a mighty tide.

FINAL 9?.

HANGAR LE BOURGET NIGHT

A squad of French police push the Spirit into the lofty
dark hangar, and, closing the massive doors, range them-
selves against them. The crowd outside can be heard in a
muffled roar, chanting rhythmically, "LINDBERGH-LINDBERGHo
.LINDBERGH—-"over and over and over again.

Lindbergh enters by a side door, followed silently and
respectfully by a few French officials. He has taken off
his flying coverall and helmet, carrying them over his arm.
He walks briskly and directly over to the Spirit, leaning
his head against a wing strut for a moment as if in silent
prayer.

He gently fingers the rips and tears in the fuselage, as
if they were living wounds, and pats it reassuringly.

Turning away from the plane, he nods to the Waiting officidh .

and walks firmly toward the exit.

LINDBERGH'S VOICE:
There were two hundred thousand people
there that night. And when we came back
homethere were four million waiting...
