"THE'OMEN"
FADE IN
EXT. THE NIGHT SK? 1.

Silent. Peaceful. The constellations SEEN clearly,
quilted against blue, interwoven with the Milky Way.

From the infinite depths of the universe, imperceptibly
at first, we begin to HEAR e SOUND. It is a CHANT. Unison
and resounding. Distant -- slowly growing in volume —-

a thousand human voices repeating the "OHM" until it fills
the atmosphere, and we begin to SENSE MOVEMENT in the STARS.

SUPER: IN WHITE, BIBLICAL SCRIPTURE:
"let'He who hath understanding
Reckon the-number of the Beast;
For it is e human number;
Its number is Six Hundred and Sixty-Six“
SUPER FADES: And the chant begins to rise in
volume, the constellations begin to shudder, as a new STAR
slowly forms in their midst.
SUPER: IN WHITE, BIBLICAL SCRIPTURE:

-- CHAPTER TWELVE
VERSE TWENTY-EIGHT --

SUPER FADES: As the chant increases in volume,
and the star takes sudden shape; fire at its center, a halo
of black surrounded by white.

A huge and ancient room, truly a place of worship: stone
steps leading to a spacious altar on which stands a huge
wooden crucifix, the figure of Christ upon it, chiseled from
stone -- block walls, sixty feet high, laced with vine-roots
that join at the center of a domed ceiling, open at the very
top to emit a shaft of light that illuminates the crucifix.

Within this chamber, a group of hooded monks pray: their
heads bowed so that nothing can be seen of them save
sackcloth as their CHANT CONTINUES, seeming to constantly
renew itself each time it begins to fade.
