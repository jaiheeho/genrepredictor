FADE IN:
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING 7 TWILIGHT

A highrise in downtown L.A., framed tall against the
mountains. People stream out of the front door, leaving
work.

CUT TO:
INT. BASEMENT

In the near darkness of basement, a security guard makes
his way into an inner cellar. His flashlight finds a man
in work clothes bent over a panel, his back to the light.

GUARD
Hey. This area's restricted.

The man doesn't look around. We can just almost see his
face as he talks.

MAN
Yeah, I, uh, got called in
some of this wiring got screwed up.

GUARD
Nobody called it down to me. I'm
gonna have to see a work order.

MAN
Yeah ... Just one second...

CLOSEUP ON HIS HAND
reaches into his toolbox.

He rises, turning, and A KNIFE ls SHOVED THROUGH Hls EAR.
It is pulled back out with calm efficiency. The man turns,
wideeeyed, hand to his ear. Mouth open in silent protest.
Out of his hand drops the work order. He slumps over.
Dies.

HOWARD FlSK takes off the guard's hat. Dripping knife
aside, he is an ordinaryelooking man. His face is dead
calm, only his eyes betraying the sea of hate behind it.

He drags the body into a dark corner, grabbing a duffle bag
from out of the shadows. Then checking his watch, he goes
to the panel and begins making adjustments of his own. WE
PAN over to the door of the panel. It reads: ELEVATORS.

CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE TOWER 7 ELEVATOR BANK 7 42ND FLOOR

It's the end of the day and people are waiting for the
elevator. The doors open, it's already crowded inside.
People groan, shuttle on. A YOUNG EXEC moos. A few people
laugh.

INT. ELEVATOR

The young exec's FRIEND presses the LOBBY button, even
though it's already lit. The young exec nods.

YOUNG EXEC
Thanks for pushing that, Bob. You
never know if the light's on, but
maybe it's really broken.

FRIEND
Oh shut up.

A SWEATY MAN, 50s, overweight, presses tighter into the
corner beside his SECRETARY. Pats at his brow with a
hankie.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

The elevator descends quickly.

ELEVATOR CABLES

Something wired to the cables, just above the elevator

car 77 a slab of white putty, a black box, wires. A small
red light flashes on the black box a split second before it
EXPLODES.

THE CABLES

Whip and snap up the shaft like retreating snakes...

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

...Blackout.

VOICES
What the hell?

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
The elevator drops fast. The voices yell.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
EMERGENCY BREAKS

Pop out, dig into ratchets in the shaft walls. Sparks
shoot out. The elevator shudders to a halt.

YOUNG EXEC
Jesus, Bob. What button did you
push?

SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE BUILDING 7 EVENING

A car comes SCREECHING to a halt near the front of the
building, a red and blue light flashing on top. The door
is thrown open and SWAT officer JACK TRAVEN steps out from
behind the wheel almost before the car has stopped. Jack
heads straight for the entrance as HARRY TEMPLE, his older
partner gets out the other side and follows, tossing Jack
his flak jacket. Jack puts it on without ever taking his
eyes off the entrance as they make their way through police
cars, fire trucks and various uniforms. WE SEE these two
are a team, and that when they move, Jack takes the lead.

We are still TRACKING with Jack and Harry as WE SEE two
more SWAT guys emerge from another car, fall into step.
Another team joins them as they enter the:

INT. LOBBY

Just as another pair burst in through another set of doors
finally eight SWAT members all wordlessly sync, walking
with Jack and Harry until the whole unit stands in front of:

CAPTAIN HERB MCMAHON, 40s, on the PHONE...NORWOOD, his
technical assistant, looks at BLUEPRINTS with BAGWELL, a
middle7aged guy with "building maintenance supervisor" on
his worksuit.

Then McMahon hangs up the phone, addresses the group.

MCMAHON
What we have is fifteen people on
the express elevator just below
floor thirty. Included among them
is Louis Tremain, chairman of Nu7
Tech and owner of this building.
(more)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MCMAHON (cont'd)
Bomb took out the cables. Bomber
wants three million dollars, or he
blows the emergency brakes.

HARRY
What's our clock?

NORWOOD
He gave one hour, which leaves us
with twentyethree minutes exactly.

A COP
Anything else that'll stop the
elevator from falling?

JACK
The basement.

BAGWELL
That's the truth.

MCMAHON
The city is looking to avoid that
event. They're gonna release the
money.

HARRY

(not really asking)
We can't just unload the
passengers.

MCMAHON
Bomber's wired the elevator doors
and the hatch to trigger the bomb.
Which seats him in the crazy but
not stupid section.

JACK
(raises his hand,
smiles)
Harry volunteers to examine the
device.
HARRY
(glaring at Jack)
Right.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

MCMAHON
Fine. You two check it out.

OTIS
Nearest access panel's on the 32nd
floor, in the hall by storage.

MCMAHON

I want reports only. We're in a
holding pattern.

(to two others)
Worthy, Briggs. Secure the base
area. No one in or out the back.

(to others)
The rest of you confirm building
evac. Move.

HARRY
(to Otis, as McMahon
is still giving
orders)
What about the other elevators?

BAGWELL
In an emergency, all passengers
cars go to the nearest floor and
shut down.

JACK
(smiles)
Looks like we're walking.
CUT TO:
INT. STAIRWELL

COMBAT BOOTS thunder up a metal staircase. Jack and Harry
sprint up the stairs.

CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
Blackness. Sounds of a power drill, muffled, through a
wall. A three7by7three foot metal access panel is lifted

away; light enters the shaft.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Jack and Harry crawl through and stand on top of the
elevator, Jack addressing the passengers while Harry checks
out the bomb. Jack has to raise his voice to be heard.

JACK

Ladies and gentleman, this is the
L.A.P.D.

(reactions; relief,

confusion)
There's been an elevator
malfunction. Just relax and we'll
have you out of there as soon as
possible.

Harry stands, gives Jack a significant look.

JACK
(smiling)
Am I lying?

HARRY
(into a mike at his
chin)
Confirm on the secondary device.
C4, molded to the brakes.
(to Jack)
What do you think?

JACK
You're the expert. I just work
here.

HARRY

It's pretty solid.

JACK
Anyone we know?

HARRY
I don't recognize the work. But
he's a pro.

MCMAHON
(voice over)
Traven, Temple. Hold position.
We're waiting to hear back from
him. Stay on idle.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
Jack looks at his watch.

JACK
Shit.

HARRY
They're cutting it close.

JACK
I don't like it.

HARRY
What's to like? Mac said hold.
We hold.

But Jack is getting real fidgety now. He looks at his
watch.

HARRY
(to distract him)
Okay. Pop quiz, hot shot.
Uh...terrorist in a crowded room,
five pounds of dynamite. He's got
a deadman's stick; he lets go, it
blows.

JACK
How close am I?

HARRY
Twenty feet.

JACK
Taser. Put enough volts in him,
he won't let go for an hour.

HARRY
..uh, fifty feet.

JACK
Nice try.
(Alternate)
Blow me!

HARRY
Okay. Airport. Gunman with one
hostage, using her for cover.
(more)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)

HARRY (cont'd)
He's almost on a plane, you're a
hundred feet away.
(a moment)

Jack?
Jack is looking at the access panel. There is a moment
before he comes back to Harry's train of thought: Then:

JACK
Shoot the hostage.

HARRY
What?
JACK
Take her out of the equation. Go

for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear
shot.

HARRY
You're deeply nuts, Jack. Shoot
the hostage...

JACK
(enough already)
This is wrong. He's gonna blow it
anyway.

HARRY
Why?

JACK
I don't know. Gut feeling.

HARRY
Well, right now Mac still outranks
your gut, so we sit.

JACK
How much do you think that
elevator weighs?

HARRY
(he's at it again)
Christ, Jack...

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (4)
Jack starts out of the shaft. Harry follows.

JACK
Maybe we can do something about
those hostages.

HARRY
We're not gonna shoot 'em, right?

OMITTED
CUT TO:
EXT. ROOF 7 DUSK

Jack bursts out of a roof access door and starts looking
for something. Harry follows him. Jack runs over to the
edge of the roof where there is a WINCH used by windowe
washers. Large, heavy7duty.

JACK
No, we just take 'em out of the
equation.
CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR 7 SAME TIME
The passengers, white with terror, fidget.
CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR HOUSING SHED

Jack and Harry lug cable from the winch into the elevator
housing on the roof.

HARRY
You sure it'll hold?

JACK
(confident)
It'll hold.
(to convince himself.)
It'll hold.

Harry looks at his watch.

(CONTINUED)

lO.

CONTINUED:

HARRY
Six minutes.

OMITTED
CUT TO:
INT. LOBBY 7 SAME TIME

Captain McMahon paces with his walkie talkie, talking to
the brass at city hall.

MCMAHON
We can't GET any more time! He's
not talking. We need goddamn

money NOW.

CUT TO:

INT. ANOTHER PLACE 7 SAME TIME

Fisk has a radio set7up, is listening in on the various
police exchanges. He suddenly hears sounds of Harry and
Jack echoing down the elevator shaft.

HARRY
Pop quiz, hot shot. Psycho rigs
an elevator to drop thirty
stories...

CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

Jack is being lowered headfirst on a rope down the center
of the shaft. He holds the window7washing cable with a
hook on its end. He and Harry are speaking through their
microphones.

HARRY
...What do you do?

JACK
Something else, right?
He continues down. The elevator approaches. Jack comes to
the elevator car...He signals and Harry stops.

(CONTINUED)

ll.

CONTINUED:

Jack looks leery at the C4 by his feet. Quietly secures
the hook to part of the elevator's frame.

JACK
Tell me again, Harry: why did I
take this job?
HARRY
Come on. Thirty more years of
this and you get a tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.
JACK
(excited)
Cool.
ANOTHER PLACE
Fisk listens. What are they up to?
HOUSING SHED
Harry looks down the shaft one more time and runs out to:

EXT. ROOF

Harry runs over to the window washing winch. He flips a
switch and the winch starts pulling in the cable.

INT. SHAFT

Jack watches as the extra cable starts unspooling, pulled
up. He starts climbing for the access panel.

EXT. ROOF

The winch spools in cable.

INT. HOUSING SHED

Harry looks down at the elevator.

ANOTHER PLACE

Fisk listens, hears the winch faintly. He fingers a small
box with a plastic button and a timer counting down. Three
minutes left. We notice that the hand fingering the box is

missing its thumb.

(CONTINUED)

l2.

CONTINUED:

The hand starts moving more agitatedly. Fisk's face
registers growing concern. Two minutes fifty7three seconds.

With sudden violence, he jabs the button.
INT. ELEVATOR

Jack takes one final look down. There is still a bunch of
slack cable lying on the elevator. On the bomb, a tiny red

light comes one.

Without hesitation Jack HURLS himself through the access
panel as the bomb BLOWS.

INT. ELEVATOR

The passengers SCREAM as the elevator shakes, begins to
drop.

EXT. ROOF

The cable snaps tight 77

INT. HOUSING SHED

*7 nearly slicing Harry in two. He dives to the floor.
THE ELEVATOR

Plummets. Comes to an abrupt stop. Springs slightly on
the cable...

INT. LOBBY 7 NEAR THE ELEVATOR BANK

Everyone listening to the TWANGING of the cable echo down
the shaft.

BAGWELL
Usually they fall down now.

INT. HALL
Harry bursts in from the stairs.

HARRY
He's early!

(CONTINUED)

l3.

CONTINUED:

JACK
Let's get them off.

EXT. ROOF 7 THE WINDOW7WASHING WINCH

The weight on the cable is starting to pull it from its

foundation. It groans and starts to crack 77 can't bear
this weight for long. The wheels start to come off the
track. Then with a loud bang, the winch breaks free, flies

across the roof and comes to a stop at the door to the
elevator machine room.

INT. HALL
Jack and Harry look at each other. And BOLT.
ANOTHER FLOOR 7 JACK AND HARRY

Emerge from the stairs, race over to the elevator access
panel...

HARRY
(into mike)
Mac! We need people on 28 now!
THE WINDOW WASHING WINCH
Gives a bit more under the strain of the cable...
THE ELEVATOR
It drops a few inches. People yell, gasp, cry.

JACK AND HARRY

Get the last screw out of another access panel. They can
see the bottom two feet of the elevator doors. With a
grunt they pry open the doors. People's feet and the
sounds of panic.

JACK/HARRY
On the floor! Hands and knees!
Let's move it!

A WOMAN lies down. Jack and Harry grab her hands, pull her
out. Then another. They pull out the CEO.

(CONTINUED)

l4.

CONTINUED:

CEO
What the hell is all this?

Two more SWAT guys arrive and help pull.

THE WINCH

About to break free...

JACK AND HARRY

...Pull out two more people...

THE WINDOW WASHING WINCH

...Rips through the door frame, wedges against an ENGINE...

THE ELEVATOR

...Drops sharply. Oh God... But then it stops, now with
only the top three feet of the elevator showing.

THE CABLE

Is being held by what's left of the platform 77 some slats

of splintering wood and lengths of bending metal. It's
giving way slowly, an inch at a time.

JACK AND HARRY

Now pull people up to get them out. They see the elevator
sinking, the opening closing. Two and a half feet. Two
feet. They have one woman to pull out. She's halfway...
her legs still in...

THE CABLE

Pulls free as the mass of wood and metal finally gives way.
THE ELEVATOR

Drops.

JACK AND HARRY

Pull the woman as hard as they can as the huge metal box
flies down, shooting out sparks 77

(CONTINUED)

l5.

CONTINUED: (2)
HER LEGS

Sliding out as the top of the car races down on them 77
she's not gonna make it *7

ELEVATOR SHAFT

The elevator drops like a rock, trailing cable. It drops
so far that it disappears from sight. A huge sound when it
hits bottom.

INT. MAIN LOBBY

McMahon and the other SWAT and bomb guys are almost knocked
off their feet by the impact reverberating throughout the
building.

ELEVATOR DOORS
In the lobby buckle out from the air concussion.
INT. HALL

The woman, terrified, looks down at her legs. The elevator
just clipped off her high heel. Jack and Harry exchange a
look.

The other SWAT guys usher the rescued passengers to the
stairwell as Jack and Harry lean against the wall, a little
out of breath.

JACK
Is your watch slow?

HARRY
(shaking his head)
He jumped the gun. We had three
minutes.

JACK
Why does he do that? He's blowing
three million.

HARRY
Maybe he couldn't hold his wad
long enough. It's a common

problem among middle7aged men,
although I myself *7

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Jack does
thinks.

l6.

JACK
He's here.

HARRY
He could've blown that thing from
Pacoima.

JACK

No, he knew we were up to
something. He's close by.

HARRY
He's not gonna corner himself in
the building. We evacuated anyway.

HARRY
So he'd want to be here, but he'd
want to be mobile.
(click)
The elevators.

JACK
Passenger cars were stopped,
right? They checked 'em out.

HARRY
What about the freight elevators?

INT. BY FREIGHT ELEVATOR

They get to the freight elevator doors, pry them open.

They look

down.

The freight elevator is stopped five floors below them.
They can hear movement in the elevator.

JACK
Will the mystery guest please sign
in...

jack slides down the elevator cable.

HARRY
Jack, we don't even know if *7

(CONTINUED)

l7.

CONTINUED:

But he's gone. After a moment's hesitation, Harry follows,
climbing down rungs.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
Jack and Harry move down the shaft.
THE FREIGHT CAR

...as Jack arrives. Pulls his 9mm Glock and steps from the
rungs lightly onto the car. HARRY right behind him. The
car sinks slightly from their weight.

Jack points at the hatch cover on the elevator roof. Harry
nods and pulls his Glock. He and Jack kneel by the hatch
cover. Jack grabs the handle. Harry makes the countdown
hand signals. Three, two 77

A shotgun BLAST nearly takes their heads off, splintering
part of the hatch cover. Both men jump back. A second
shot right by Harry's foot sends him jumping away, he steps
on the hatch cover and it gives away. He falls into the
elevator, hitting his head badly.

JACK
Harry!

We HEAR Harry being knocked out by the butt end of a rifle.
INT. ELEVATOR

Fisk's finger pushes a button on a control panel.

JACK

Sprawled out as the elevator starts to rise. Another
shotgun blast takes out a plate7sized chunk right next to
him.

Jack wants to return fire, but hears Harry yelling in pain
and doesn't know where to shoot. Another blast right next
to him keeps him prone in the corner. He senses something
and looks up.

HIS P.O.V.

The elevator barrels toward the ceiling of the shaft.

(CONTINUED)

l8.

CONTINUED:
JACK

With no other choice, jumps feet first through the pen
hatch.

INT. ELEVATOR

Jack comes crashing down into the elevator, lands hard.
The air is thick with shotgun smoke. The few lights not
shot out flicker. Jack looks up and is transfixed. He's
looking into...

THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN
He hears a voice out of the smoke.

FISK
I don't suppose anybody would pay
three million just for you.

Fisk chuckles. Then a loud, dull click. Another click.
The shotgun is empty.

JACK
Brings his gun up fast.

JACK
Drop it!

The gun drops. Through smoke and flickering light, Jack
gets a good look at Howard Fisk. Fisk is calm, his arm
around the still groggy Harry. In his hand is a deadman's
stick. His coat opens enough for us to see he has sticks
of dynamite roped around his chest.

FISK
Pop quiz, hotshot. Terrorist
holding a police hostage. He's
got enough dynamite strapped to
his chest to blow the building in
half. What do you do?

INT. LOBBY
McMahon screams into his walkie talkie.

(CONTINUED)

l9.

CONTINUED:

MCMAHON
I want location on those goddamn
shots! Briggs! Where is Jack and
Harry?

NORWOOD
Sir, we got movement in the
freight elevator.
McMahon looks at him, puzzled.
INT. ELEVATOR

Jack keeps steady aim at Fisk.

JACK
There's gonna be fifty cops
waiting for us in the basement.

FISK
Standard flanking deployment,
right?
Fisk opens the elevator control panel. Wires feed into a
small box Fisk has hooked up. Fisk hits a couple of
buttons.
FISK
Maybe we'll just get off on the
third floor.
INT. LOBBY
The elevator indicator light stops at the third floor.

MCMAHON
Third floor! Let's move it!

The SWAT cops run.
INT. ELEVATOR
Ding! The elevator reaches Pl.
FISK
Well, end of the line. This day
has been a real disappointment, I

don't mind saying.

(CONTINUED)

20.

CONTINUED:

JACK
Why, 'cause you didn't get to kill
everyone?

True hatred flashes in Fisk's eyes.

FISK
There'll come a time, boy, you'll
wish you never met me.

JACK
I'm pretty much there already.

Fisk starts to back up, dragging Harry with him.

FISK
See, I'm in charge here! I drop
this stick, they pick up your
friend with a sponge.

ANGLE ON HARRY
The Deadman's stick right before his eyes.

FISK
(to Harry)
Are you ready to die, friend?

HARRY
Fuck you.

FISK
(warily)
In two hundred years we've gone
from 'I regret that I have but one
life to give for my country' to
'fuck you.'

HARRY
Go ahead! Drop the stick!

JACK
(to Harry)
Shut up!

FISK
Man, we got all the balls in the
world right here!

(CONTINUED)

2l.

CONTINUED: (2)

JACK
Give it up!

Fisk drags Harry out. Jack doesn't know what to do.
Harry looks at Jack. He barely mouthes the words.

HARRY
Shoot the hostage.

Jack can't move. Fisk and Harry head toward swinging doors
that lead to the garage. Jack watches, gun trained on Fisk.
HARRY
Do it.

He shifts aim and BLASTS Harry in the leg. Harry goes down
and Fisk can't take him anywhere. Almost laughing with
disbelief, Fisk lets go, starts running.

Jack starts shooting through the pipes and crates. One of
the shots grazes Fisk in the neck, spins him back to face
Jack. Even then, Fisk has this strange grin on his face.
FISK

STUMBLES through the doors.

JACK

Runs after him, reloading as he does...

THE DOORS

...Swing back and forth. They slow. Stop.

A HUGE EXPLOSION

Blasts out from the garage. Rips the doors from their
hinges. Lights go out. Plaster and cement flies.
JACK

Is knocked fifteen feet back into the far wall. He lies
still.

FADE TO BLACK

22.

INT. CITY HALL MEDAL CEREMONY 7 DAY

The elevator hostages and cops in attendance. Jack and
Harry stand to one side of the podium in full dress uniform
as the Mayor gives a droning speech. Harry has a cane.

MAYOR
...the dedication and bravery that
make L.A.'s finest truly her
finest. Fifteen citizens owe
their lives to this team, and
particularly the two officers we
are here to honor... Thanks to
them, the only life taken by a
terrorist's bomb was his own...

ANGLE ON JACK AND HARRY
Eyes front. Harry quietly fumes.

HARRY
You shot me...I can't believe
it...they're giving you a medal
for shooting me, you little
prick...

The Commissioner pins on Harry's medal. There is applause.
The Commissioner moves to pin on Jack's medal and we:

CUT TO:
INT. FISK'S GARAGE 7 CONTINUOUS
WE SEE the ceremony on TV, a close7up of Jack's face as the
audience applauds again, somewhat louder. PULL OUT TO
REVEAL a bank of four TVs, all showing the same shot of
Jack. The TVs are all fairly old, not fancy.

Fisk sits before the screens, stone faced. Slowly, loudly,
he applauds.

CLOSE UP ON HIS HANDS

Again WE SEE it; no left thumb.

23.

EXT. FISK'S HOUSE

We hear the clapping as WE SEE his house in the twilight.
A completely unremarkable suburban home, flanked by two
more just like it.

CUT TO:

INT. BAR 7 THAT NIGHT

The local cop dive. The cops sit clustered at a few
tables, celebrating. McMahon is standing, making a toast.

MCMAHON
Okay. Okay. Here's to harry, for
his quick thinking, his grace
under pressure and his brave and
selfless act...

Many "Here here"s.
MCMAHON
...and to Jack, for shooting
Harry, which God knows we've all
wanted to do for some time.
Laughs. McMahon quiets them.
MCMAHON
No. Okay. You know what it is:
To the guys, for doing your job
and not getting dead. Mazeltov.

Everyone drinks. McMahon sits as Jack is called upon to
speak.

COPS
Speech! Jack, a toast! Come on.

He doesn't want to, but he stands.
JACK
Okay. Um, I'd like to thank all
the little people 77

Many boos.

(CONTINUED)

24.

CONTINUED:

JACK
77 I'm fuzzy on names, but I know
you're all very tiny. Harry,
you're a god... Uh, I don't
know... here's to...tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.

"Here Here"s. Everyone drinks.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BAR 7 LATER

The dregs of the occasion. The few that are left are
fairly soused. McMahon and Jack are at the bar, talking.
The bartender, SANDY, pours them each a shot.

SANDY
Here you go. Thirtyefifth round
is on the house.

JACK

(to Mac)
Nobody wanted me to be a cop. My
dad said if I wanted to prove
myself as a man I should sell
tires like him.

(to Sandy, re: shots)
His is bigger than mine.

Harry sits at the table with a few cops, including ROBIN,
a female cop. He vaguely paws at her as she stands.

HARRY
Come here. Come on, hey, sit on
my lap. Sit on my lap and do a

dance.
She fends off his hands.
ROBIN
(good naturedly)

Piss off, Harry. You're married.

HARRY
I am?

(CONTINUED)

25.

CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON JACK AND MCMAHON

MCMAHON
That's what this job is. It's
those moments when everything
compresses and it's just you and
him. That moment. Other jobs are
just typing. And that's what real
people don't understand about cops.

JACK
That we're psychotic.

MCMAHON
Yes. Well put. That was your
problem with what's7her7name.
What was her name?

JACK
(thinks a moment)
Debbie.
MCMAHON
Debbie.
(remembering)
Donna!
JACK
Oh. Right.

ANGLE ON HARRY

Is looking at a picture of his wife in his wallet.

HARRY
This is my wife? She's gorgeous!
I'm going home! I'm gonna get

some .

He staggers up and over to Jack as McMahon heads for the
john.

HARRY
Jaaaaaack.

JACK

(imitating him)
Haaaaarry. Druuuuuunk.

(CONTINUED)

26.

CONTINUED: (2)

HARRY
(puts his arm around
him)
Jack...You know what we are?
We're the two luckiest guys in the
world. Got the bad guy and didn't
lose any civilians.

JACK
We're good.

HARRY

(dead serious, in his

face)
We're lucky. Understand it, Jack.
We were dealing with a total
psycho; he could have blown us up
anytime. I got a bullet in me 77
six inches off the mark and they
give the medal to my wife.

 

JACK
Harry, man, we won. We got him.

HARRY
Do you listen? I'm not gonna be
backing you up for a long while,
so you gotta start thinking.
Guts'll get you so far, and then
they'll get you killed. Luck runs
out, Jack. Sooner or later.

A moment, as Harry's words sink in. Harry's said his
piece: he pulls himself up, swaying. Jack helps him.

HARRY
I'm gonna go home and have some
sex.

JACK
Harry, you're gonna go home and
throw up.

HARRY

Well, that'll be fun too.

(CONTINUED)

27.

CONTINUED: (3)
As they EXIT FRAME we:

CUT TO:
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT 7 MORNING

Jack's airy Venice loft apartment. Very clean, slightly
industrial in look. A large model of a sailing boat
proudly displayed in one corner, the other corner holds a
complete entertainment center. Sports equipment is
carefully placed along one wall.

Jack wakes up lying on top of his covers, wearing shorts
and a tee shirt. He looks much the worse for wear. The TV
is on by the bed, the Today show blaring at Jack. He sits
slowly up and regards the TV with a bleary eye.

JACK
Katie...Love me, Katie. Bryant
will never respect you the way I
do.
Wincing from a hangover, he pulls on his sneakers. Gets

up, grabs some aspirin that he chews like candy, going for
the door and the CAMERA TRACKS ALONG, leading him as he
heads out...
EXT. JACK'S HOUSE
...the door and starts slowly down the street, jogging,
picking up speed, the bleariness leaving his face and we
are still leading him along as he starts sprinting, running

BOB
Hey, Jack. You look like a side

JACK
Thanks, Bob.

VINCE
The boy was up late celebrating.

VINCE has Bob's coffee ready; they make the exchange like
clockwork.

Jack heads for his car as Bob crosses back to his bus.

BOB
Wild party, huh?

JACK
I don't remember that well. Can't
have been too great; I woke up
alone.

BOB
Yeah, well, last time I partied
like that I woke up married.

Bob hops in the bus and takes off. Jack puts his breakfast
on the top of his car as he digs for his keys.

THE BUS

explodes.

JACK

half7turns as the shock wave knocks him off his feet. Car
alarms wail. People run. The bus carcass burns, twisted
metal and flaming plastic where Bob was. Jack moves

forward on instinct, but there's nothing he can do and the
flames force him back.

As Jack stares in shock, we notice a PHONE RINGING, getting

louder as it filters into Jack's consciousness. Suddenly
it dawns on him and he turns, dreamlike, and walks to the
phone. Picks up the receiver.

Twenty second delay on the

think I wouldn't have prepared?
I spent two years setting up my
elevator job. Two years. I
invested myself in it. You
couldn't understand the commitment
I have. A child, Jack, you're a
child. You ruin a man's life's
work, and then you think you can
walk away? You got blinders on,
to the world. But I got your
attention now. Didn't I, Jack?

JACK
Why didn't you just come after me?

FISK
Oh, now you're getting a swelled
head. This is about my money, the
money I'm due, which I will get.
Three point seven million dollars.
That's was my original sum, plus
interest compounded quarterly and
expenses. None of this had to
happen, Jack. I hope you realize
that. That bus driver could have
gone home to his wife and children
tonight.

him? He's so late coming home...

JACK

When I find you, man, I'm gonna
kill you all over.

FISK
Pop quiz, hotshot. There's a bomb
on a bus. Once the bus hits fifty
miles an hour, the bomb is armed.
If the bus drops below fifty, it
blows up. What do you do?

Jack is still lost.

FISK
What do you do?

Jack pauses, accepting the challenge.

JACK
I'd want to know what bus it was.

FISK
You think I'm going to tell you
that?

JACK
Yes.

FISK

(smiles)
Very good.

(smile vanishes)
Now there's rules, Jack; we have
to do this right. No one gets off
the bus. If you take any of the
passengers off, I will detonate
it. If I don't get my money by
ll:OO a.m., there is also a timer.

Jack looks at his watch. It's 8:05

The bus is pulling away. ANNIE, an attractive
twentysomething in an Arizona tee shirt and casual clothes,
bolts after it. It is a good half block away by the time
she reaches it. She runs alongside, yelling at the driver,
mimes begging, smiling, praying.

SAM, the driver, finally relents. He stops and opens the

with bills.

ANNIE
Do you have any change?

He rolls his eyes as:

Annie is exchanging money with MRS. KAMINO, an Asian office
worker.

ANNIE
Thanks. I have all this change at
home, but I always forget...

MRS. KAMINO
That's okay.

She deposits the change and makes her way to the middle of
the bus. She waves to ORTIZ, a large repairman.

ANNIE
Hey, Ortiz.

ORTIZ

She plops herself down in front of DOUG STEPHENS, an
obvious tourist.

STEPHENS
First time in L.A.?

ANNIE
No, I live here.

STEPHENS

No, I mean mine. Well, that's

I'm sightseeing. I hate to use
the word 'tourist', but 77

(holds up his map and

camera)
It's not like I can hide it!

ANNIE
Not really.

STEPHENS
You know, it took me three hours
just to get here from the airport.

I got so lost. L.A. is one large
place. But you live here, you
probably don't notice. I'm such

a yokel. There; I said it.

While he is saying it, Annie quickly sticks her gum on her
seat.

ANNIE
Oh! There's gum on my seat! Oh,
eew.
She stands, points.
ANNIE
(as if teaching him
the word)
Gum.
Thus excused, she makes her way back to the front. She

sits by HELEN, a middle7aged secretary. Smiles vaguely at
her.

ANNIE
Morning.
HELEN
You're lucky, you know. Sam

wouldn't stop for just anyone.

Helen.

HELEN
Oh I just couldn't drive on the

Can't you go over them?

Jack grins. It's going to be okay.
EXT. THE FREEWAY

A halfemile ahead, there's an accident blocking the three
right lanes. There are flames on the road and a POLICEMAN
is trying to direct traffic.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Traffic is backed7up a hundred yards from the accident and
is tunneling through the one open lane 77 the far left lane.

Jack sees the bus. It is mired in the jam as well. But
it's all the way over to the left, fifty yards from Jack.

Jack pulls his car over onto the right shoulder, stops and
gets out. He hurries for the bus. It's a race against
time, as the bus is heading for the choke point, building
speed as the cars funnel through ahead of it.

Jack gets to the bus, just as it's about to go past the
accident. He runs along beside it, knocking on the bus
door.

JACK
Stop! Open up!

MRS. KAMINO
That guy really wants to get on
the bus.

ANNIE

(dryly)
Can you blame him?

SAM
Get off the doors, man! Wait for
the next one.

JACK
L.A.P.D.! Stop the bus!

But he is barely audible from inside. He pulls his badge
out of his back pocket, but is bumped by a passing car in
the right lane, and drops it.

HELEN
Maybe you should let him on, Sam.

Annie gives a concerned look.

Sam speeds up to get away from Jack as Jack retrieves the
badge.

A young Hispanic, RAY, watches Jack chasing the bus. He
looks around at everyone nervously. Says nothing.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

Jack tries to get in front of the bus, but Sam doesn't slow
down, so Jack has to get out of the way.

The bus is getting away. He's running as fast as he can.
He tries to pull the rear doors. No go. The doors slip
from his grasp. He pounds futilely on the last plastic
side panel, and the bus is gone.

Jack staggers, doubles over, exhausted.
Cars honk at him, swerve around him.

Jack looks back. His car is a half mile back, still in
thick traffic, not an issue. Jack stops out in front of
the oncoming cars.

JACK
Stop!

We hear brakes screeching and a man yelling.

JAGUAR OWNER
What the fuck?

THE JAGUAR OWNER, late 20s, curses Jack from behind the
wheel of his brand new XJel2 CONVERTIBLE. Jack flashes a
badge.

JACK
LAPD. Get out of the car.

JAGUAR OWNER
Oh, Jesus, not again.
(to Jack, pissed)
This is my car, okay? I own this

Jack pulls his gun.

It is now.

Jack opens the door.

JACK
Move over.

Sam shakes his head 77 he can't hear Jack.
Jack looks around. Sees sheet music on the back seat.
JACK

Grab that, willya? I need

The Jaguar Owner hesitates a beat, then grabs the sheet
music.

JACK
I want you to write on the back in
big letters. Bomb on bus.

Looks around. How to do this? He looks at the Jag's

door 77 it's a problem. So he speeds ahead of the bus,
opens the door, swings it wide. The wind tries to push it
shut but he holds it.

get into it. Jack prepares to jump. He's just about to.
But...

Some YAHOO in front of him is going forty. He has to
swerve.

JACK

Yells, leaps from his car. It doesn't look like he's going

handrail at the front of the bus. Jack howls. His
shoulder is wrenched.

HIS FEET

Are dragging over the pavement.

THE JAGUAR

The owner is struggling to get control of the car. He
can't do it in time. The Jag plows into the big yellow
waterefilled collision barrels at an off7ramp.

The driver, unhurt, cranes to see if Jack made it okay.

Pulls himself with one arm, up onto the bus steps.

Everyone on the bus is staring at him. Jack holds up his

What's going on? Are you crazy?

JACK
Ma'am, if you'll please sit down,
we can deal with this in an

ANNIE
But what are you 77

JACK
Ma'am.

His tone is so stern she sits right down. Jack makes his
way down the bus, looking at everyone.

In the back, Ray starts sweating as Jack approaches.
His hands reach for something under his coat.

JACK
...If everyone will just stay in
your seats and remain calm and
quiet, then we'll be able to
defuse the...problem. So, sit
tight.

Ray suddenly leaps out of his seat.

RAY
Get away from me!

He levels a gun at Jack. Instinctively Jack whips his own
out, and the two are at close range stand7off. Ray looks
more scared than anything. There are a few screams.

Look. I'm putting my gun away.

Okay? Okay? Listen. I don't
care about your crime. Whatever
you did, I'm sure...that you're
sorry, and so it's cool now. It's
over.

on the ground)
And I'm not a cop right now. See?
We're just two cool guys. Just

Despite the fumbling manner of Jack's speech, his tone does
have a hypnotic lull. Ray looks like he might lower the

gun.

Ortiz jumps him.

hit in the back.

The bus swerves sickeningly as Sam slumps over. Annie
dives for the wheel, Helen to help Sam.

Jack moves in and with two crunching blows disarms and
subdues Ray. Simultaneously:

Move him!

HELEN
He's bleeding!

ANNIE
I've got to stop this thing!

Jack spins around.

JACK
NO! Stay above fifty!

ANNIE

Silence. Annie looks briefly back at Jack, sees he's not
kidding. She looks back at the speedometer, which is

Mrs. Kamino pulls off her sweater, going over and wrapping
it around Sam's shoulder.

We're only gonna make it through
this if everyone stays calm and
sits down.

Terry moves to help lay Sam out more comfortably. Jack
goes over to Annie. She is staring straight ahead, death
grip on the wheel: she's terrified.

She takes a breath. Calms herself. He dials.

ANNIE
You're a cop, right?

JACK
That's right.

There is an obscene mass of plastique stuck to the front.
Detonators, wires, a jerry7rigged timer built around a

Unbeknownst to them, a WOMAN, 30s, pushes a BABY CARRIAGE
along the sidewalk. She is talking to another woman.

INT. THE BUS
A moment's respite. The cellular rings.
JACK

Yeah...Mac, where've you been? We

had to bail on the freeway, we're

in the city!

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. CHOPPER

McMahon is looking out the window. He has a map of the
city on his lap.

MCMAHON
I can see you, Jack.

ANGLE ON MCMAHON'S P.O.V.
The bus charges through the maze of streets.
MCMAHON
Keep going straight. We're trying
to clear the roads for you. We'll

get you out, Jack.

He consults the map closely, trying to pinpoint the bus's
location.

THE BUS

Barrels down the streets.

INT. FISK'S ROOM

As Fisk watches, eating a baloney sandwich on white bread
and a glass of milk. WE SEE that three of the TV's have
the bus on them, but the fourth one is turned to a football
game.

INT. POLICE STATION

Harry looks at the things on his desk; evidence from Fisk's
last job, lined up and tagged. Robin is standing nearby
with SWAT Cop #i.

ROBIN
I don't get it.

HARRY
A watch is a shitty timer. Why
use it? What's he saying?

ROBIN
Lots of people have watches, Harry.

ROBIN
This guy has no M.O. Bombers fall
in love with one kind of bomb and
they're very monogamous. This guy
uses C4, dynamite, different
trigger every time, now he throws
in this watch.

ROBIN
He's an encyclopedia. Knows every
kind of bomb.

HARRY
(slow realization)
And everything we do to dismantle
them. Robin, I want to look at
files from the last, say, ten
years.

ROBIN
We did the mug shots, Harry *7

HARRY
No. I wanna look at cops.

57.

EXT. A STREET NEAR THE BUS

Cars cruising to an intersection are overtaken by a
screaming black & white. It reaches the intersection and
turns, screeching, halting in front of traffic and blocking
the intersection.

The cars slam on their brakes, nearly hitting the patrol
car. The passengers barely have time to curse before the
enormous bus ROARS by, going the other way.

INT. THE BUS

The passengers watch the city streets fly by, panic volume
turned high.

ANNIE

SEES a GARBAGE TRUCK back out in front of the bus.
ANNIE

Pulls the wheel hard left.

THE BUS

Swerves into oncoming traffic. The bus dodges oncoming
cars, trucks and other buses, bumping a few. A Lincoln
peels off the side of the bus, goes flying.

EXT. THE STREET

The two women wave goodbye. Woman #l pushes the baby
carriage toward the curb.

INT. HELICOPTER
Mac still looks at his map.

MCMAHON
You got about...ten more blocks
and there'll be some units
waiting. Follow them straight,
then there's a left at the T.
You'll head onto the l05 freeway.
It's not in use yet; it'll be
empty.

58.

INT. THE BUS

JACK
Right.

EXT. STREET 7 THE BUS

Continues on.

THE WOMAN AND THE BABY CARRIAGE

Steps out from behind a van right in front of the bus.
ANNIE AND JACK

Horror. It's too late. Annie shuts her eyes.

THE BUS

Smashes into the baby carriage as the woman pushing it
jumps clear.

JACK AND ANNIE
Her eyes are shut. She screams. Jack can't help but look.
JACK'S P.O.V.

SLOW MOTION. The baby carriage is knocked seventy feet in
front and to the side of the bus, sailing through the air.

JACK
His eyes following. He grimaces as...
THE BABY CARRIAGE

Hits the pavement. But then... a hundred empty soda and
beer cans explode out of it.

INT. THE BUS
Jack smiles.

JACK
There's your baby.

Annie opens her eyes, looks in the sideview mirror.

(CONTINUED)

59.

CONTINUED:
HER P.O.V.

The woman is running after the bus, shaking her fist,
stopping to pick up the cans.

Annie sighs with relief.

ANNIE
Looks just like you, honey.

THEIR P.O.V.

Here at last are the patrol cars, which start up, leading
the way.

INT. THE BUS

Everyone watches the streets. After a few blocks...
THE PATROL CARS

Come to the on7ramp. The bus follows when...

A GROUP OF SCHOOL KIDS

Walk blithely in front of it 77 Annie is forced to SWERVE
and continue on the street parallel to the freeway.

ANNIE
(panicked and pissed)
Why aren't they in school?
JACK
(into phone)
Mac, we're boned!
INT. CHOPPER

MCMAHON
I saw. Keep straight.

He consults the map.
INT. BUS

Patrol cars pull in front of it again, leading it.

60.

INT. CHOPPER

MCMAHON
Jack, there's another entrance in
about two miles. You've gotta
make an ugly turn, though.

JACK
How ugly?

ANNIE
(worried)
What's ugly?

Jack listens a moment more on the phone.

JACK
(to Annie)
We got a hard right coming up. At
the construction site.

Annie looks out the window. The construction site is far
away but visible. Annie can't even see the road to turn on.

ANNIE
This is a dead end.

JACK
(staring out, not
convinced)
There's a turn...

There is a turn. Way ahead, the first patrol car takes
it 77 and nearly wipes out. Another follows, with all
attendant screeching.

ANNIE
I can't make that!

JACK
Keep left.

ANNIE
But it's 77

JACK

Keep left! You take it wide!

ANNIE
We're gonna tip over!

(CONTINUED)

6l.

CONTINUED:
A beat.

JACK
Everyone on this side of the bus!

The passengers hesitate.

JACK
Now!

The passengers all scramble, squeeze in by each other.
They look at each other, scared. Ray strains to get over,
cuffed.

JACK
Move! Move! As far over as you
can! Hurry!
Annie eases the accelerator off as far as it is safe. The

turn is fifty yards away.
JACK
(quietly, into the

phone)
Mac, you better clear the site.

He turns back to Annie.
Annie arcs out to flatten the turn as much as possible.

ANNIE
Hold on!

She turns the wheel and dives into the turn. The
passengers are thrown. Most hold on.

The bus tires screech on the pavement. One wheel lifts off
the ground for a second.

Some passengers scream, most hold their breath.

Annie strains against the steering wheel to hold it steady.
She's losing it.

Jack grabs the wheel and pulls it with her, holding the
turn. The bus wheel comes back down onto the pavement.

(CONTINUED)

62.

CONTINUED: (2)

Annie and Jack bring the bus back into line. They made it.
Jack turns back to the passengers, smiling.

JACK
As you were.

INT. BUS

As the passengers untangle themselves, Helen looks white as
a sheet.

HARRY
Good lord, we might have...I can't
think...

STEPHENS

(helping her sit)
It's okay. If you need to, you go
right ahead and vomit.

EXT. THE BUS

Reaches the on7ramp, shoots up through the saw7horses and
they're on.

THE CHOPPER

Touches down nearby. Mac gets out, talking to Norwood as
he tries to fold the map.

MCMAHON
I want choppers up ahead, make
sure there's nothing obstructing
the freeway. We got a window
here; let's keep it open.
INT. THE BUS
A moment of respite.

ANGLE ON ANNIE AND JACK

JACK
Ma'am, you did very well.

He looks at her. Drops the hostage talk, smiles.

(CONTINUED)

63.

CONTINUED:

JACK
Actually, you were incredible.
I've never seen driving like that.

ANNIE
Annie.

JACK
What?

ANNIE

..is my name. Annie. As opposed
to ma'am.

They smile at each other for a moment. Annie looks back at
the road.

JACK
I'm sorry?

ANNIE
Why is all this happening? Did we
bomb this guy's country or
something?

JACK
It's just a guy that wants money.

Annie looks at Jack.

ANNIE
No... I don't buy it. This is not
a good way to make money. Odds
are, we should be dead already.
What's this guy's deal?

JACK
(after a beat)
A while back this guy held some
people for ransom. It went sour,
and now he's a little pissed at me.

ANNIE
Then what does this 77

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

64.

(2)
JACK
It's a game. If he gets the
money, he wins. If the bus blows

up, he wins.

ANNIE
So what happens if you win?

JACK
Then tomorrow we'll play another
one.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION

Harry and

Robin lean over a computer worked by SWAT Cop #l.

On the screen, a series of faces flash by.

She goes.

SWAT COP #1
We got no match for that

years.

RAY
He could be from anywhere.

SWAT COP #1
I can't access all that 77

HARRY
Forget the files.

EXT. THE BUS

McMahon pulls up next to it on the back of a flat
Jack comes out on the steps to talk to him.

MCMAHON
Let's start unloading the

JACK
Can't do it, sir.

MCMAHON
No time for stunts, Traven. We
get those people out of harm's
way 77

JACK
I got orders.
(indicates news
choppers)
We move these people, he'll see.
Crazy not stupid, remember?

Mac accepts it, scowling.
MCMAHON
Harry's working on finding this

guy. We think he may be a police.

Norwood leans out of the cab of the truck.

NORWOOD
It's him. He wants to talk to
Jack.

JACK

Give him the number.
He steps into the bus, look at Sam.

it looks on the TV like you're
trying to get those passengers off

JACK
You gotta let me have one.

FISK
Now, we went over the rules...

JACK
Come on, as an act of faith. We
got an injured man here. The

driver's been shot.

FISK

No one gets off.

charity. There's still gonna be
plenty of us to kill.

FISK
Okay, son. You can try unload the

What about the rest of us?

MRS. KAMINO
You have to keep him straight or
I think the wound will tear.

JACK
(into walkie talkie)
McMahon, he's letting us unload
the driver. Pull up alongside us.

He bends over to grab Sam's feet.

JACK
(to Sam)
How're you feeling?

SAM
Like I've been shot.

Jack lifts, so does Ortiz at the head. Sam groans with
pain and Ray rushes in to support his middle. He and Ortiz
exchange a look. They walk him to the doorway.

McMahon's truck is right next to them. Jack stands on the
bottom step, yells to the SWAT guy on the truck.

JACK
We gotta keep him straight!

The SWAT guy nods. Jack inches out farther. He holds
Sam's legs with one hand and the railing with the other,
leaning out toward the truck. The pavement rushes by
underneath him. The SWAT guy grab Sam and slowly, the
exchange is made.

Jack steps back into the bus, where Mrs. Kamino is wiping
up blood.

JACK
I think he's gonna be 77

Wait!

Helen suddenly leaps out of her seat and rushes to the

No!

He rushes to the front.
Helen stands. The SWAT guy waves for her to jump.
INT. FISK'S ROOM
Fisk sees this on TV. He punches a button on his cellular.
UNDER THE BUS
The small bomb directly below Helen. Red light comes on.
THE FRONT STEPS
Explode. SWAT guys are knocked off their feet, Jack is
knocked into Annie and the bus swerves. Helen falls. Jack
grabs at her too late, the bus bumps sickeningly, as Jack
almost falls, grabbed by the lady in Catwoman's glasses.
For a moment, nothing. Jack sits back on the floor of the
bus at Annie's feet, staring at the hole that was steps.
Annie is nearly hyperventilating, her eyes locked on the
road.
FISK
Watches on the TV. Smiles.
FISK

Interactive TV, Jack. Wave of the

Ortiz takes his jacket off, puts it around Mrs. Kamino's

shoulders.

ORTIZ

MRS. KAMINO
Thanks you. I'm a little cold.

STEPHENS
(quietly and politely
hysterical)
Jesus. I can't be here. I
can't 77 this bus is 77 this is
the wrong bus... for me to... I

can't die here.

ORTIZ
Hey, shut up, man! I got a wife!
STEPHENS
(in his own world)
You do?
TERRY

(curious, but with a

little attitude)
So if you have a wife and I don't,
does that mean that I'm expendable?

ORTIZ
What are you talking about? The
guy's just talkin' crazy, gets on
my nerves!

And then all at once:

STEPHENS
I think I have the right to be a
little upset after all we've 77

ORTIZ

What are you staring at everybody
for, poking your nose in, let us
die in peace, you 77

RAY
Let's stop all this bullshit,
we're just making more trouble 77

TERRY
(to Ortiz)
I'm interested to see how long
before the mighty caveman comes to
the surface and starts throwing
rocks at people's heads 77

As the din rises:
JACK

Hey, can that shit! Jesus, it's
like a school bus!

He looks at Annie. She is shaking with the effort not to
cry.

JACK
(kneeling by her)
Are you okay?

ANNIE
NO.

JACK
What do you need?

She takes a moment. Jack brushes hair from her face.

ANNIE
When that bomb went off...

(CONTINUED)

72.

CONTINUED: (3)

JACK
I know.

She shakes her head.

ANNIE
When it blew, I thought that was
it, I thought that was the bomb
and I was dead, and... when I saw
her fall under the bus, I was...

This is not an easy thing to say.

JACK
You were glad you were still alive.

ANNIE
(it's true)
Oh God, I'm sorry.

JACK
Don't be. You should be glad. We
all are. That doesn't mean you
don't care. It means you're a

human being.

ANNIE
She looked so scared...

JACK
She was scared. She was a nice
lady who didn't deserve to get
killed. But Annie, if she'd
gotten off he would have killed us
all. He's the asshole, Annie, the
guy who put us here. Remember
that. Okay?

She nods, shakily.

ANNIE
(a little embarrassed)
Do they teach you how to talk nice
to hysterical hostages in cop
school?

(CONTINUED)

73.

CONTINUED: (4)

JACK
No, it's mostly tying square knots
and how to build fires, stuff like
that.

She smiles a little.

JACK
We should be okay for a while.

INT. THE TRUCK
Listening on a headset, Norwood's face goes dazzling white.

NORWOOD
Oh my God. Are you sure? How far?
(to McMahon)
Sir, we have a serious problem.

MCMAHON
What?

NORWOOD
This freeway isn't finished.

MCMAHON
What are you talking about?

NORWOOD
The choppers caught is about three
miles ahead. There's a section
missing.

MCMAHON
But... It's on the map! It's
finished on the goddamn map!

NORWOOD
I guess they fell behind.

MCMAHON
Fuck! You're fired, everybody's
fucking fired. How big a section?

NORWOOD
Fifty feet, at least.

It's big.
INT. THE BUS
JACK

You're kidding.

MCMAHON
Fifty feet, it's in the
interchange, somewhere after the
next turn.

JACK
What do we do?

MCMAHON
We gotta get them off someway.

JACK
There's a gap in the road. Couple
of miles up.

Various reactions. Groans, fear, tears. People look at
each other, realizing these are the last faces they're
going to see. No one knows what to say, except maybe Ortiz.

ORTIZ

You can always count on the cops,
man...

ANGLE ON JACK AND ANNIE

ANNIE
Oh God, oh no...well, what if I,
uh, shift to neutral and keep the

JACK
He'd've thought of that.

ANNIE
Well, what, then?

They're waiting for his answer, which he doesn't have. He
thinks.
JACK
Floor it.
ANNIE
NO.
JACK
Yes! It's an overpass, there
might be an incline. Floor it!

She nods. The bus starts picking up speed.
The speedometer climbs above sixty.

Jack starts toward the back of the bus. The passengers are
silent, terrified. He looks at their faces as he passes.

JACK
I want everybody to hold onto the
seat in front of them, or

whatever's nearest. Heads down.
(to the lady with
presents)

Put that stuff under your seat.
STEPHENS
(scared)
Is this really gonna work?

Jack looks at him a second. What do you say?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

JACK
Definitely.

He comes to Ray, unlocks his cuffs. Ray looks pretty small.

RAY
I didn't mean to shoot that guy.

JACK
(not unkindly)
Keep hold of the seat in front of
you.

Which means, for now, apology accepted. Jack moves back to
the front.

Jack looks out the window 77 the signs and barriers are
approaching.

JACK
Everybody hold on!

People grab rails, cling to them, heads in their laps.
Ortiz takes a cross from under his shirt, palms it.

ANNIE
I'm okay. I'm all right.

Jack stands, addresses the passengers.

JACK
Is everybody okay?

They're bruised, dazed, bleeding 77 but whole. A muted
chorus of "yeahs", followed by some boisterous whoops and
even applause. People laugh, hug, high five. People who
were crying are now laughing and crying. Terry kisses Mrs.
Kamino (but only if they're sitting by each other).

ORTIZ
You're the man, Annie, you are the

her with honest admiration.

JACK
I think you missed your calling...
(dabbing at the blood
with his sleeve)
You should have been a pilot.

She smiles, too. Jack sees something ahead. Gets an idea.
He has to act fast.

JACK
Get off! Now! Get off this 77

She hesitates a second too long for his liking, so he grabs

What do you want?

FISK
Money, Jack. I wish I had some

I'm just like you and me. I'd
like large nonsequential bills in
two clear plastic bags. Unmarked.
Can you remember all that?

JACK
What are you telling me for?

FISK
I want you to help me get it
before it gets too late. I don't
like negotiators, Jack. They talk
to you like they're your best
friend, and they don't know you.
Why do they mess with me, do they
think I'm doing this for fun?

JACK
Aren't you?

FISK
Oh, that's not fair, Jack. You

Everybody sit tight. I'm getting

Don't worry... I won't go far.
(to Annie)
Just keep circling. You'll be
fine.

Annie looks at him. She knows she may not see him again,
but she's gonna be brave.

ANNIE
(a little weakly)
Don't forget about us, okay?

They look at each other for a moment. Jack tenderly
brushes her hair from her face. He's never gonna forget
her.

Jack turns to the doorway. He motions for the truck to
come in close.

He jumps. For a moment everyone is silent on the bus. The
host has left the party.

JACK AND MCMAHON

talk as the GMC Suburban veers off the road and the bus
charges off in the distance behind them. They pass a news
van, cops keeping the news people from filming.

MCMAHON
The choppers are gone, Jack; let's
dump the passengers now.

JACK
No way. He's ready for that.

MCMAHON
But how is he 77

JACK
I don't know how. I just know he
is. He's been a step ahead of me
every time. If we unload he'll
take them out, I guarantee.

(CONTINUED)

85.

CONTINUED: (4)

MCMAHON
Where does that put us?

JACK
I got to try to dismantle that
bomb.

MCMAHON

That's not an option.

JACK
What would you do if the bus was
standing still?

MCMAHON
Jack, it's not.

INT. THE BUS 7 ANGLE ON TERRY AND RAY 7 MINUTES LATER
They sit near the back.

TERRY
So, what'd you do, man?

RAY
What?

TERRY
Why'd you go apeshit before?
What'd you do?

RAY
Nothing, man. Leave me alone.
TERRY
Come on! Was it a gang thing,
what?
RAY
Nothing!

(after a moment)
I stole the gun, man. You know.
From my cousin.

TERRY
What for?

(CONTINUED)

86.

CONTINUED:

Ray looks sidelong at Terry. He's either being defensive
or lying.

RAY
Home protection.

ANGLE ON THE FRONT
Ortiz and Stephens are standing at the front with Annie.

ORTIZ
I'm telling you, Annie, the guy's
somewhere jerking off.

ANNIE
He didn't have to get on in the
first place, Ortiz. And get your
ass behind the yellow line. I
have faith.
(to herself)
I have faith.

STEPHENS
What's that?

They all look out at something pulling in front of them.
Their eyes go wide.

ANNIE
Oh my good he is insane.

ANGLE ON THEIR P.O.V.

A truck has pulled in front of them. Attached to the back
is a low wooden dolly. Jack is standing on it in his SWAT
gear, with a headset and a bunch of tools.

ON THE TRUCK

McMahon is on the back of the truck. He has a headset as
well.

MCMAHON
We're not gonna be able to keep
this steady for long.

(CONTINUED)

87.

CONTINUED: (2)

JACK
I just need a few minutes. If I
can't do it by then I can't do it
at all.

MCMAHON
All right.

JACK

(into headset)
Harry. You with me?

HARRY
(o.s.)
All the way.

MCMAHON
Okay, this is it. Don't get dead.

Barely a moment between them, and then Jack is lying down
on the dolly.

ANGLE ON ANNIE
Watching the dolly inch closer.

ANNIE
(slowly, as it sinks
in)

This is a really bad plan.

STEPHENS
Have faith, sister.

Jack smiles at Annie, gives her the thumbs up.

ANNIE
Oh, Christ.

ORTIZ
Just keep it steady.

ANNIE
Gee, thanks for the tip.

The truck slows a bit and the dolly inches closer to the
bus. Jack lies completely flat as the bus approaches.

(CONTINUED)

88.

CONTINUED: (3)

He starts to disappear under the bus. Annie squints with
concentration. McMahon looks on, concerned. Jack looks
straight up, keeping as calm as possible as the bus covers
his head.

UNDER THE BUS

Jack inches under the bomb. He speaks (always into the
headset, until stated otherwise) to McMahon.

JACK
Okay, tell them to hold here.

He looks up at the bomb. From his P.O.V. the bomb is so
close it fills our line of vision. There are wires running
from the timer to various detonators. Also a few covered
wires of different colors sticking in one end of the timer
and out the other.

INT. POLICE STATION

HARRY
What do you see?

JACK
It's pretty standard. Timer's
looped to the remote, then feeds
out.

HARRY
Then we gotta try to bypass the
remote current with the battery.
Can you find the trip wire for the

remote?

JACK
I don't know. I got a few choices
here.

HARRY

Black and red?

JACK
And green.

(CONTINUED)

89.

CONTINUED:

HARRY
Okay. Listen. I'm guessing he's
not going to use standard copper
for the remote. Too weak. I'd
use a fiber alloy. I need you to
look at the wire.

JACK
It's covered.

HARRY
I know. You gotta cut off the
sheath. But don't cut the wire.

JACK
Right.

HARRY
Start with the green.

He has to work slowly. He's so close to the bus he can't
look at his tools; he feels for them and brings them up to
his chest.

He palms an exacto and carefully starts scraping away at
the green plastic covering.

The bus hits a tiny...
BUMP

and Jack SLIPS, goes stock still as sweat drips down his
forehead. He looks at the knife. It has gone halfway
through the wire. Very, very slowly, he pulls it out.

He scrapes some more at the sheath, revealing a silverish
wire: not copper.

JACK
Bullseye.

HARRY
Great. Clip on the battery and
run it to the lead wire.

He palms the battery, clips one end to the silver wire with
the alligator clip. He searches out the lead wire. He
finds it, a cloud crossing his expression.

(CONTINUED)

90.

CONTINUED: (2)

JACK
I can't bypass. It'll fire.

HARRY
Collapsible circuit.

JACK
Yeah. Shit! This thing is
airtight.

Harry is thinking when Robin enters, moves toward him with
a printout, speaking.

ROBIN
Howard Fisk, Atlanta P.D., bomb
squad, retired to Sun Valley in
l989 when a small charge left him
with fingers numbering nine.

And on that last word she reaches Harry, turning the

printout for him to see and Fisk's picture stares us in the
face.

HARRY
That's out scumbag.
(into walkie talkie)
Jack, we found him!

ROBIN

We can get to his place inside of
fifteen minutes.

HARRY
Jack! Get out of there and sit
tight! We're going after the
source.

JACK
Watch your back.

Harry jumps up and they move out.

JACK
Mac! Pull me out!

MCMAHON

(o.s.)
Roger that, kid. Hold on.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)
ANGLE ON THE TIRE

That was scraped by the claw...a piece of outer rubber
peels off and flies into the:

DOLLY WHEEL

which catches, stops.

JACK

As the dolly is almost pulled out from under him.

THE CABLE

Is running past him now, skittling over the pavement,
sparking, whipping around. And it's heading for a rear
wheel. If the cable gets pulled under the tire...
JACK

Reaches for the cable, to pull it back. Too late.
THE CABLE

Hits the wheel and is sucked under in a flash.

JACK AND THE DOLLY

Are snapped toward the wheel.

INT. THE BUS

ANNIE
God!

STEPHENS
Did we hit him? What happened?

RAY
He's not behind us!

Annie and Ortiz look at each other. They're dragging him.
Ortiz RACES for the center panel, starts unscrewing it.

(CONTINUED)

92.

CONTINUED:
MCMAHON'S AIRPORT VEHICLE

moves alongside the bus. McMahon tries to see what's
happening to Jack. He looks pretty concerned.

UNDER THE BUS
Jack tries to get a grip on the undercarriage, but his
fingers can't find purchase. So he grabs the screwdriver

and stabs it up into the undercarriage. It digs in. He
stops, and the dolly is yanked out from under him.

THE DOLLY

Hits the rear wheel, is pulled under and destroyed.

JACK

holds onto the screwdriver. Liquid sprays down on him. He
coughs, reaches out, grabs a hydraulic line and pulls
himself away from the spray. His shoes skid over pavement
at 50 m.p.h. Jack looks around, sees light coming from the
hole in the floor, three feet away. He reaches for the

hole. He can't make it.

JACK
Hey!

Ortiz sticks his head down.

ORTIZ
Man, can you reach me?

He reaches for Jack, but there's no way.

ORTIZ
Hold my legs!

INT. THE BUS

Terry and Ray grab Ortiz's legs. Stephens and Mrs. Kamino
grab them.

UNDER THE BUS
Ortiz is halfway through the hole. He reaches for Jack.

(CONTINUED)

93.

CONTINUED:

ORTIZ
Come on!

He grabs him. Jack lets go the screwdriver, grabs Ortiz's
shoulder.

INT. THE BUS

Slowly, painfully, Jack is pulled in. He hunches over, in
pain.

JACK
Thanks.

TERRY
Are you okay?

He nods.

STEPHENS
Any luck with the bomb?

JACK
Yeah, it didn't go off.

Ortiz dusts him off. Oddly enough, he is smiling.

ORTIZ
You may be a psycho, man, but you
got some big round balls.

JACK
That's very... gross, Ortiz.

He goes over to Annie.

ORTIZ
Can't even pay the guy a
compliment.

JACK
How you doing?

ANNIE
You scared the shit out of me,
Jack. Other than that, I'm pretty
lousy. What's that smell?

(CONTINUED)

94.

CONTINUED:

JACK
(realizing)
It's gas.

ANNIE
We're leaking gas?

JACK
We are now.

ANNIE
What, you needed a challenge?

ANGLE ON GAS GAUGE
It starts dropping, barely perceptibly.
MCMAHON

on the back of the airport vehicle, is relieved when he
sees Jack surface inside the bus. He gives a thunmbs7up
sign to Jack and his vehicle falls back.

EXT. STREET

Harry's car and another unmarked fire up the street with
much attendant screeching.

INT. BUS
Jack and Annie nervously regard the gas gauge.

JACK
(into walkie talkie)
Mac? Can you get a fuel truck to
pace us here? We're losing gas.

MCMAHON
I'll see what I can find. How
much time?

JACK
I don't know. Ten minutes. It's
not good.

ANNIE

Is that gonna work?

(CONTINUED)

95.

CONTINUED:

JACK
I don't know.
(to himself)
Come on, Harry. Save my life.

CUT TO:
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE
Harry and the others pull up quietly across the street. He

and Robin emerge from his car, two other SWAT guys from the
second car. One is SWAT Cop#l. They go to the front of

the house in standard formation. They stop at the windows
by the garage. The venetian blinds are still down 77 can't
see in.

Harry motions for two to go around the back. He takes
Robin around the side.

There is a door here. Robin is about to try the knob but
Harry GRABS her hand, shakes his head. He motions for her
to go around the back, which she does.

He tries the window and it gives. It's clean, no wires.
Harry goes in first. He climbs slowly, pulling his wounded
leg in. He gets in.

INT. HOUSE

Harry is in the living room, heading for the garage. WE
SEE Robin come silently in through a back window, motion
for the other two to wait outside. She and Harry both
start converging on the garage, looking around them, guns
raised.

Harry looks down at his leg just as it trips an electric
eye in the doorway.

THE ELECTRIC EYE
is wired to something. A red light goes on.

Harry and Robin look at each other, knowing it's the last
thing they will ever see.

96.

EXT. HOUSE

The explosion blasts out the windows, sending the other two
flying, wounded. The last thing WE SEE are the venetian
blinds as they are shredded when that window is also blown
out.

There is a pause. And Jack knows.
FISK
I'm sorry, Jack. He didn't make
it.
JACK
You FUCK!
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. FISK'S ROOM
FISK

It was the watch that led him to
me, wasn't it? It felt a little
hammy to me, building the bomb
from my previous retirement gift.
But I figured a sign that said
'I'm Howard Fisk' would be pushing
it.
As he speaks, he opens the venetian blinds. We look out on

Pershing Square: he was never in the house at all.

JACK
I'm gonna rip your fucking spine
out, I swear to God.

FISK
You'll do as you're told! Now
Harry's gone. Just accept it.

FISK (cont'd)
Jack, we both know he was the
brains of your particular
operation. You're not gonna beat
me. You're gonna pay me all of my
dollars. Otherwise you, the
wildcat and every innocent soul on
that bus is gonna end up just like
your friend. Now pay attention!
Are you listening?

JACK
(softly)

Yes.

FISK
Good. Tell them the drop point is
Pershing Square. There's a
garbage can on the northeast
corner. Dump the bags and leave.

I don't show up until your people
are gone and I don't disarm until
I'm clear. Getting on toward
ll:00, Jack. I think it's gonna
be a pretty day.

INT. THE BUS

He hangs up. Jack SMASHES the phone against a pole,
furious. Everybody stares at him. He leans against the
front window., seething.

ANNIE
Jack?

He throws the remains of the phone to the floor, unable to
respond.

ANNIE
Goddamnit, Jack, don't you fold on
me now!

He whips his head around, stares at her.
ANNIE
You just cool it, okay? We're
scared. We need you.

ANNIE (cont'd)
I need you, with a clear head. I
know this guy's hurting you and
I'm sorry, but we still have a
problem here so stop doing the
asshole dance and be part of the

solution.
He still stares, but she's drawn the fire out. Everybody
is staring at him. He smiles winningly at Annie.

JACK
We're gonna die.

ANNIE
We got this far.

He falls silent again. His gaze goes from her face to her
shirt, the Arizona tee shirt. For a moment he looks almost
puzzled.

ANGLE ON THE SHIRT

Beneath the Arizona is a picture of a wildcat.

JACK
I'll be damned.

Jack kneels by her, daubing her brow, speaking softly.

JACK
You go to University of Arizona?

ANNIE
(puzzled)
Yeah.

JACK
Good football team.

ANNIE
Yeah...
JACK
Arizona Wildcats. They went nine

straight wins last year.

CONTINUED: (2)

ANNIE
(completely lost)
Right.

Jack smiles.

JACK
He can see you.

She starts to ask but he shushes her, standing and leaning
again on the windshield. Slowly he looks around at the
front of the bus. His P.O.V. searches for it, and there it
is, behind the big convex mirror with a view of the whole
bus. The thin wires, the red light. A camera. We push in
on it 77

INT. FISK'S ROOM

...and pull out, looking at the camera's P.O.V. on a small
black and white screen next to Fisk's other TVs. We pull
out further to see Fisk as his eyes flit from screen to
screen, resting on the black and white image.

On the screen, Jack kneels once again by Annie.
INT. BUS
JACK
He called you a wildcat before.

I didn't even pick up on it.
Bastard has a camera right in your

face. He can see the whole bus.
He's been playing me from minute
one.

Doesn't look like. He's just
watching.

JACK
Nothing. Act scared.

circle?

He holds up a finger to shush her as McMahon gets on the
line.

EXT. AIRPORT
McMahon arrives at the base camp.

MCMAHON

CREW GUY
Sure.

MCMAHON
Good. There's a signal coming
from that bus. Find it.

The crew guy starts turning dials. After some snow, the
shot of the bus appears on one of his screens.

MCMAHON
Good. Tape off this.

The crew guy sticks in a tape, hits "record." An angry
reporter steps in.

REPORTER
Hey, this is private property!
You can't just take it!

MCMAHON
Yeah, why don't you call a cop?

INT. THE BUS

Jack is sitting near the front. Everyone is sitting,
looking tense.

JACK
(quietly, but to
everyone)
Remember, no big movements. Just
look whipped.

ORTIZ
That's not gonna be too hard.

And WE PAN along the bus, picking up everyone's face as
they try to appear casually despondent. We pass Jack and
Annie and close in on the fuel gauge 77 is it picking up
speed?

UNDER THE BUS

WE SEE as the screwdriver is jolted looser and looser, and
the leak grows.

McMahon and the others watch the bus on screen.

INT. THE BUS

Annie notices the fuel gauge as it drops below a quarter
tank.

ANNIE

Our leak has sprung a leak. We
gotta get off.

Slowly, Jack brings the walkie talkie to his face.

JACK
McMahon? Fuel?

MCMAHON
Five minutes.

Mrs. Kamino drops her purse, nervous. She doesn't know if
she should pick it up. Sits nervously.
JACK

Not enough time. Run the tape.
We have to unload.

MCMAHON
We only got a minute of 77

JACK
Do it!

smiles as he leads her away.

EXT. PERSHING SQUARE 7 LATE

The can stands alone on the northeast corner.
INT. THE STOREFRONT

Jack is becoming increasingly agitated.

NORWOOD
He's running a little late.

Jack looks at his watch. ll:02.

JACK
He's not late.

MCMAHON
What?

JACK
He's never late.

NORWOOD
That money hasn't moved. We've
got two hundred eyes on that can.
We've got a homing beacon in the
bags. He's covered.

JACK
Turn it on.

NORWOOD
What for? He's not 77

(CONTINUED)

ll3.

CONTINUED:

JACK
Do it!

Norwood does, looks down.
ANGLE ON THE HOMING DEVICE
The bags are moving.

NORWOOD
Shit...

Jack bolts for the can.

MCMAHON
Jack!

CUT TO:
EXT. PERSHING SQUARE
Jack DASHES across the street. He runs to the garbage
cans, pushes them over. Below where the garbage can
stood, there's a jagged hole in the concrete, opening up

into a utility access tunnel.

JACK
Son of a bitch 77

INT. TUNNEL

Jack hang7drops down into the tunnel. He hears the sound
of hurrying footsteps down the tunnel. Jack pulls the gun
from his waistband and takes off after the sound.

FARTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL...

...SOMEONE runs, holding the bags of money. Jack pulls out
his Glock, draws a bead...

JACK
FREEZE! Turn around!

The person stops.

(CONTINUED)

ll4.

CONTINUED:
JACK

Pop quiz, asshole. I got a hair
trigger aimed at your brain and
I'm in a really shitty mood. What
do you do?

The person turns, face coming into the light. It's...

ANNIE

And she is very scared.

JACK

Incredulous.

ANNIE

opens up the jacket she's wearing to reveal TEN POUNDS OF
C74 strapped to her chest.

JACK
Christ.

An EMERGENCY DOOR on the side of the tunnel opens.
FISK
Steps out, holding a deadman stick.
FISK
Be prepared. That's the boy

scouts marching song.

ANNIE
I'm sorry, Jack.

FISK
What do you do, Jack. Can't shoot
her.

JACK

Let her go.

FISK
I don't think I'm gonna do that.

He has a bag, which he drops at Annie's feet.

(CONTINUED)

ll5.

CONTINUED: (2)

FISK
Fill it.
(to Jack)
I think Harry would be
disappointed, finding us right
back where we started.

JACK
Let her go! You got the money!
Take it and walk! You don't need
her!

FISK
You still don't understand, Jack.
The beauty of it. A bomb is made
to explode; that's its meaning,
its purpose. Your life is empty
because you spend it trying to
stop the bomb from becoming. And
for what? For who? You know what
a bomb is, Jack, that doesn't
explode? It's a cheap gold watch.

JACK
You're crazy.

Annie finishes filling the bag. Fisk takes it.

FISK
Poor people are crazy, Jack.
(hoisting the bag of

money)

I'm eccentric.

JACK
(one last time)
Let her gp!

Fisk looks at Jack, almost fondly. Then he bolts through
a door with Annie, slamming it shut behind him.

Jack runs up to the door.

INT. THE TUNNEL

Jack tries the door. It's locked. he aims his gun and
blows the door handle to pieces. He tugs the door open and

light floods in.

(CONTINUED)

ll6.

CONTINUED:

Jack steps through the door and is very surprised to find
himself in...

EXT. A SUBWAY STATION

He's on the upper level. Not many people around. Someone
runs up the stairs, looking frightened. jack down the
stairs.

INT. THE SUBWAY PLATFORM

People are shying away from Fisk and Annie as they make
their way along the platform. He has his gun out and she's
wearing bombs. People start getting off the subway,
heading for the stairs. Fisk pulls Annie onto the first
car.

INT. FIRST CAR
Three people, sitting. Smiles at one of them.

FISK
Is this seat taken?

Everyone clears off. All the cars are empty now as the
doors close and the train starts moving.

INT. PLATFORM

Jack runs down the stairs, yelling. Sprints along the
platform as the train starts pulling out of the station.
He jumps, just grabs the end of the fourth car.

INT. THE SUBWAY TRAIN

Fisk handcuffs Annie to a vertical handpole. He hands her
the deadman stick.

FISK
You don't want to drop this. I'm
counting on you.

He moves to the front of the car as the driver starts out
of the compartment.

DRIVER
What the hell is going 77

(CONTINUED)

ll7.

CONTINUED:

Fisk SHOOTS four times at point blank, sends him flying
back into the compartment. Two of the shots blast the
control panel. Annie cries out.

INT. THE SECOND CAR

Crouching, Jack is making his way to the first car, leaving
the connecting doors open as he goes. He peers into the
first car as Fisk finishes shooting, just in time to see
him retrieve the deadman's stick.

FISK
Smiles at Annie as he takes it.

FISK
Maybe I better hold this after
all. I'm afraid you're a little
hysterical and might let go a mite
early. It's not 'cause you're a
woman.

He heads for the back and almost sees Jack. With nowhere
to go, Jack climbs on the top of the car. Fisk looks out
at the other cars.

FISK
Looks like we're all alone.
Nobody wanted this train.

ANNIE
You can let me go. You won, you
beat Jack, you beat everyone.
Throw me off the train, I don't
care. Only let me go.

He speaks to her softly.

FISK
This stick works on a remote.
See, when you explode, that's
where they'll come. But it's not
where I'll be. Mess like that,
they don't even count the body
parts. Gives me time.

He brushes hair from her face.

(CONTINUED)

ll8.

CONTINUED:

FISK
It's not gonna hurt, Annie.

ON TOP OF TRAIN

Pipes and concrete ceiling whips by Jack's head. He checks
his gun and a red conduit pipe RIPS it from his fingers.

INT. THE CAR

Fisk and Annie HEAR the gun bouncing off the top of the
car. Fisk looks up, smiles a little wildly.

FISK
Is that you, Jack?
(to Annie)

He's persistent. He always gets
his man.
He grabs the bag of money, opens it. Looks up again.
FISK

Don't suppose you'd be interested
in a bribe, would you?
(chuckles)
Got plenty to go around...
Inside the bag, a dye pack explodes.

Fisk looks down at his now useless money, some of the dye
dripping like blue shadows on his face. He SCREAMS.

Still roaring, Fisk whips out his gun and pumps a round
into the ceiling.

TOP OF THE TRAIN

Fisk's bullets come up all around Jack, the last one
ripping into his arm. He clutches it, in agony.

IN THE TRAIN

Fisk keeps firing until the gun clicks repeatedly. Even
then, it's hard for him to stop.

(CONTINUED)

ll9.

CONTINUED:
ON TOP OF THE TRAIN

No more shots 77 Fisk must be out of bullets. Jack starts
inching for the back of the car.

Fisk is right behind him.

Unchecked fury mars his face more than the eerie dye. All
semblance of control is gone. Roaring, he SLAMS his fist
into Jack's face.

He practically foaming at the mouth, hitting Jack with the
hand that holds the deadman's stick. Jack is helpless;
he's wounded and Fisk has the stick. He feebly tries to
defend himself.

Fisk is on his knees over Jack. He starts hitting Jack in
his arm wound. Jack nearly blacks out from pain.

FISK
What do you do, Jack? What do you
do? You're so smart! Right,

Jack? You little piece of shit!

I got the plan! I'm smarter than

you! I'm smarter than you!
JACK'S P.O.V.

Blurred, shifting. There is light on the ceiling. They're
tearing through another station.

Jack suddenly pulls back his leg and SLAMS it into Fisk's
solar plexus. Fisk flies back, standing straight up on his
knees and:

A RED CONDUIT PIPE

meets his face.

SOMETHING ROUND

Bounces along the top of the train like a tin can discarded
along a freeway...

FISK'S HAND

clenched in a literal death grip over the stick...it starts
to loosen...

(CONTINUED)

l20.

CONTINUED: (2)

...and Jack GRABS the hand at the last second, closing it,
taking the stick before Fisk's body even hits the top of
the train. Jack holds the stick, out of breath.

JACK
Yeah, well, I'm taller.

INT. TRAIN

Annie turns warily at the sound of a door sliding open.
Relief. It's Jack.

ANNIE
Fisk?

By way of reply, he holds the deadman's stick up, almost
smiling. Annie looks very relieved.

JACK
I ripped his head off.

He takes off her vest and defuses the C74 and neutralizes
the deadman stick. Goes to the driver's compartment.

INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

Sparks. The equipment was shot to shit. Jack sees the
braking controls, flips the switches. Nothing. Grabs the
speed dial/lever and tries to pull it back toward the left,
but it won't budge. It's jammed up. Pushes it forward 77
the train goes FASTER. Tries the radio mike 77 DEAD.

JACK

RUNS back into the passenger compartment.

JACK
C'mon, we gotta jump.

She shows him her handcuffs.

JACK
Shit!

ANNIE
You can't stop it?

(CONTINUED)

l2l.

CONTINUED:

He pulls at the hand cuffs, pulls at her wrists, tries to
unscrew the pole with a knife 77 nothing.

THE TRAIN

barrels down the tunnel.

JACK

Goes apeshit. He kicks the pole, screaming with effort.
Again. Again. Pulls at it. Pulls at her till her wrists

bleed.

ANNIE
NoooooOOOWW!

He stops. Her eyes are wet.

ANNIE
Jack, you have to get off.

No way. He looks up at the map. There's a big curve, then
dead end.
ANNIE
Jack, listen to me...the end of
this line is solid rock. You have
to jump. Goddamnit, I'm ordering
you! Go!

He looks at her.

JACK
Faster.

ANNIE
Jack...

Going to the driver's compartment.

JACK
The only way to stop this thing is
to make it gg faster. There's a

curve up ahead. We go fast enough
we might jump the track, hit
something besides a dead end.

l22.

INT. THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
Turns the knob hard right, comes back out...
ANNIE

This is bullshit, Jack. You have

to get off this train, Jack! Jack!
He says nothing. Comes up to the pole she's at, holds on.
Braces himself. She falls silent as well. Drops her cuffs
around him. Holds him tight. They wait.
The train ROARS along the track...
INT. HIGHLAND STATION

Still under construction. At the end of the station the
track dead7ends into a ROCKFACE.

JACK AND ANNIE

brace themselves...

JACK
C'mon...Let's go...
EXT. THE TRAIN
Barreling through the station... it's going way too fast,

but it's holding the tracks.
JACK AND ANNIE

Jarred by the rough ride. The lights flicker on and off.
Smoke from overheated engines rises into the car.

INT. TUNNEL

The construction crews are fleeing. A truck speeds off up
the ramp, hauling dirt out.

THE TRAIN

Hits the curve. The train wheels SPARK on the rails,
SCREECH.

JACK AND ANNIE
Eyes shut, holding tight.

(CONTINUED)

l23.

CONTINUED:

THE TRAIN

With Jack and Annie skids sideways up the ramp... Steel
SHEARS the car in half... The front half continues to skid

and roll up the ramp and...
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD 7 THE TRAIN

...appears. Above ground, like a breaching whale, skidding
and crashing and finally resting on its side in front of

the Chinese Theater, to the amazement of dazzled onlookers.
Jack and Annie visible through the now7open back of the car.

CUT TO:
INT. TRAIN

Jack and Annie sit up, find they are all right. The pole
has been wrenched from the ceiling and Jack pulls Annie's
hands free. They suddenly kiss, desperately alive.

ANNIE
You didn't leave me...
(looks him in the eye)
You didn't leave.
(holds him again)

My God...

JACK
I didn't have to be anywhere just
then.

ANNIE

How boring?

JACK
What?

ANNIE
How boring are you? I mean, is it
really scary?

JACK
(thinks a moment)
I watch bowling on TV.

ANNIE
Okay.

(CONTINUED)

l24.

CONTINUED:

JACK
Sometimes when I watch bowling, I
get excited and I cheer.

ANNIE
Ooh. Well...
JACK
Annie, it's over. You can walk

away.

She takes his hand, quickly and gentle clicks the other
cuff on him, joining them.

JACK
Whatever you say, Ma'am...

And they sit awhile.
TOURISTS WITH CAMERAS

arrive on the scene. Train their cameras on the kissing
pair.

FADE OUT.

THE END
