EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY - 1

A visually beautiful HIGH ANGLE SHOT of midtown
Manhattan'towards the end of an early October
afternoon.

NARRATION

Would it not be strange, in a city
of seven million people, if one
man were never mistaken for another...
if, with seven million pair of feet
wandering through the canyons and
corridors of the city, one pair
of feet never by chance strayed
into the wron footsteps?

(a pause
Strange, indeed.

MAIN TITLE AND MUSIC COME U? OVER SHOT.
CUT TO:

A SERIES OF STREET SCENES 2-10

Over them, THE CREDITS. These scenes should capture
the tempo of Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue in '
the Fifties. Streets swarming with smartly dressed
People. Revolving doors of sleek new glass-end-
steel office buildings spewing out streams of
super-charged New Yorkers, hurrying for cabs and
busses and subways and cocktail bars. Two bundle-
laden women fighting over a cab. A packed bus
closing its doors in the race of an irate would—be
passenger. A newsboy in front of the Independent
Subway entrance.‘ "Trouble in the Middle East!
Evening papers! Get your trouble in the Middle

things humming. Doors close on an elevator.

VOICE at the rear of the car even before the (2)

man is revealed to us by the off—going
passengers. He is ROGER THORNHILL, tall.
lean, faultlessly dressed (and far too
original to be wearing the gray-flannel
'uniform of his kind). He has been dictating
to his secretary, MAGGIE, an aging, unbeautiful
woman who has accompanied him down in the ele-
vator with pad and pencil in hand. She will
have to scurry to keep up with his impatient
stride when they leave the elevator and cross
the lobby to the entrance.

THORNHILL (dictating)

belief that a high Trendex
automatically means a rising
sales curve, which incidentally
I do not accept...

newsstand, buys a paper)
...And let the opposition have
their high ratings, while we cry
about it all the way to the bank.

Colony one day next week for lunch?

EXT. MAIN HOUSE 27

An impressive though considerably faded mansion
of the early Twenties. The car swings around

the circular driveway, pulls up before the
entrance. Thornhill and the two men get out.

One of the men (he of the scarred eye — his

name is VALERIAN} accompanies Thornhill up the
steps to the front door. The other man (LIGHT)
follows them and waits until the door opens before
he moves away and follows a path to the rear of
the house. After a moment. a stocky. gray-haired
woman wearing the uniform of a HOUSEKEEPER opens
the front door. Valerian walks Thornhill right in
'past her.

shelves of books)
Don't hurry. I'll catch up on
my reading.

Valerian closes the door-behind him. Immediately,
Thornhill goes to the door to open it. Just as
his hand reaches the knob, he HEARS the DOOR being
LOCKED from the outside. He tries it anyway, then
turns, glances around, walks to the desk. sees
several magazines there: FIELD AND STREAM...

we see that the addresses on all of them is:

BACK LAWN - THORNHILL'S POINT OF VIEW 30

A man is playing croquet all by himself in the
fading light. His name is LEONARD. Later, we
will see him at closer range and perhaps be
slightly repelled. He is about thirty,-but
looks much younger, for he has a soft baby-
face, large eyes and hair that falls down over
his forehead. His attitudes are unmistakably
effeminate. Hurrying towards him is LIGHT,
the other abductor. In a brief pantomime, Licht
apparently gives Leonard tidings, and they
quickly go off together towards the house.

INT. LIBRARY 31

Seeing the back lawn now deserted, Thornhill tries
to open the window to escape. It is locked. He
unfastens the catch, raises the window, is about
to climb out when he draws back and turns at the
SOUND of the DOOR OPENING behind him. In walks a
distinguished looking HAN of about forty, profes-
sorial in manner but definitely sexually attractive
(to women), and only slightly sinister.

HAN (affably)
_Good evening...

He holds out his hand. Thornhill takes it uncertainly.

THORNHILL
Not a moment too soon.

HAN (scrutinizing him)
Well - so...

THORNEIUD
Thank you. That explains everything.

HAN (still peering at him)
...Not what I expected - a little taller,
a little more polished than the others...

Not a quart, Mr. Kaplan. It's

err. HILL ROAD - NIGHT 35

Two'cars are making their way along a winding,
precipitous road. The lead car is a light
colored open Mercedes Benz. Behind it is the
limousine which brought Thornhill from the Plaza
Hotel to Glen Cove. We HEAR THORNHILL'S VOICE
coming from the lead car in drunken song: “Some-
where I'll find you...sneek up behind you..."

The two cars come to a stop at the top of the hill.
The driver of the linousine gets out quickly and
we see that it is Licht. He crosses over swiftly
to the Mercedes Benzo

hurriedly pulls Thornhill into the driver's seat.
Then, as Licht runs to the limousine, Valerian
gets into the Mercedes Benz beside Thornhill,
reaches across and starts the rotor.

THE CHASE SEQUENCE £2

The Mercedes Benz can take the sharp curves with
more ease than the limousine. Also, Thornhill is

too far gone to know that he shouldn‘t drive that
fast. Consequently, he gets to the foot of the

hill and down to a main thoroughfare still in the
lead. Naturally, we film this ride, and that which
follows, from many different angles, including
Thornhill's delirious double—vision point of view.

He will be killed it he is caught, and he will be
killed if he keeps driving-this way. There is very

almost directly in front of them, take off after
Thornhill. Valerian signals to Licht to slow
down. Licht does so, and starts to make a
U-tul‘n. -

THE MERCEDES BENZ

Thornhill tries desperately to keep his eyes
in focus, his foot on the floorboard and his
hands on the wheel. HORNE BLARE warningly as
he comes perilously close to several headon
crashes. In his rear-view mirror, he sees
the headlights of the police car following and
does not realize that it is no longer the
limousine. The headlights are coming closer.
Suddenly, almost too late, he sees ahead of
him an elderly gentleman on a bicycle emerge
from a side road. He slams on the brakes and
the car comes to a screaming, wobbling stop.
The bicyclist, oblivious, continues across.

SIDE ANGLE

As Thornhill's car comes to a final, Jerking
halt, the police car, with screaming brakes,
hits Thornhill's rear. There is a CHUNCHING
SOUND as the bonnet of the police car crumples
like tin. There is a MOMENTARY SILENCE and
then the sudden SCREAM of more BRAKES, and a
third car smashes into the back of the police
car, giving it a crumpled rear as well. '
Thornhill drunkenly leans out and looks behind
to see what all the fuss is about. The two
police, after forcing a door open, emerge,
glowering. At the same time, the third driver
is seen getting out of his car, somewhat be-
wildered, and starting forward.

PROFESSOR ” 7?
No my dear woman, we are not being CONT'D
callous. We did not invent our (k)

nonwexistent man, and establish

- elaborate behaviour patterns for
him, and move his prop belongings
in and out of hotel rooms, for
our own pgivate amusement. We
created George Kaplan and labored
to convince vandamn that this
phantom was our own Number One,
hot on his trail, for a desueratelx

important reason.

REPORTER
Check.

STOCK BROKER
Nobody's denying that.

PROFESSOR (passionately)
All right then. If we make the
slightest move to suggest that there
is no such agent as George Kaplan...
give any hint to vandamn that he's
pursuing a decoy instead of our real
Number One...then Number One, working
right under Vandamm's nose, will
immediately face suspicion, exposure
and assassination, like the two
others_who went before.

There is a moment of embarrassed silence around
the table as they all realiza the unpleasant truth
of what the Professor has Just said.

There is a LOUD CLATTER as Mrs. Thornhill hangs

As he emerges from the booth, he comes face to
face with a large man who could be a detective.
For a brief tense moment they stare at each
other, and then the man steps past him into the
booth. Thornhill looks about cautiously then
starts walking across the lobby towards the
ticket windows, CAMERA MOVING with him. Near the
Information Booth, 3 man stands reading the center
pages of the N.Y. POST. Thornhill sees the front
page headlines: "NANHUNT ON FOR U.N. KILLER." This
reminds him'to take out dark glasses and put them
on which he does as he continues across the lobby

There is a commotion around the steps of the car
from which Eve and Thornhill alighted. On the
top of the steps appears a hatless, middle—aged
man in his underwear, socks and shoes. Behind
him are two uniformed policemen pushing him down
the steps to the platform. Our two detectives
quickly step forward to question him. At the
same time, the two uniformed police alight to
the platform and complete the small knot of

men surrounding the uniformless Redcap. For a
moment we see the hapless Redcap gesticulating
as he describes how he came to be in this state
of undress. Then suddenly the police and
detectives dash away and down the platform
toward the main lobby, leaving the man standing
there in his underwear.

INT. MEN'S ROOM

There is considerable activity here. At the

row of wash basins stand three men. One is
washing his hands, the other is scraping away

at his chin with a straight razor, and the

third man - Thornhill - is busily rubbing in a
foamy lather which covers the lower half of

his face. He is in his regular trousers by now.
and his Jacket hangs nearby. At his feet stands
Eve's small zippered bag. The Redcap uniform is
nowhere to be seen. Suddenly the door bursts
open and our two detectives enter. Thornhill
and the other men turn at the commotion, casually
watch the detectives glancing about in search

of their quarry. As Thornhill turns back to the
mirror and continues to lather his face, we HEAR
the SOUND of stall DOORS OPENING and BANGING
CLOSED. Their mission unaccomplished. the
detectives go out. Thornhill nonchalantly finishes
his lathering, then looks down and picks up his
razor, which, up to now, we have not seen.

It is the tiny one belonging to Eve. He starts
to draw it down his cheek, leaving the narrowest
of lines down the lather. Then in the mirror

he catches sight of the man with the straight
razor staring at him in bewilderment.

black sedan looms up, travelling at high speed.
For a moment we are not sure it is not hurtling

turns toward the stranger as though to say some-
thing to him. But it is too late. The man has
boarded the bus, its doors are closing and it is
pulling away. Thornhill is alone again.

GUNNED To A HIGHER SPEED. He glances off sharply,
sees the plane veering off its parallel course and
heading towards him. He stands there wide-eyed,
rooted to the spot. The plane roars on. a few
feet off the ground. There are two men in the twin
cockpits, goggled, unrecognizable, menacing. He
yells_out to them, but his voice is lost in the

zooms over him with a great noise, almost

combing his hair with a landing wheel.

Thornhill scrambles to his feet, sees the plane 115-115:
banking and turning. He looks about wildly, sees CONT'D
a telephone pole and dashes for it as the plane (h)

comes at him again. He ducks behind the pole. The
plane heads straight for him, veers to_the right
at the last moment. We HEAR two sharp CRACKS cf
GUNFIRE mixed with the SOUND of THE ENGINE, as

two bullets slam into the pole Just above
Thornhill's head.

Thornhill reacts to this new peril, sees the plane
banking for another run at him. A car_is speeding
along the highway from the west. Thornhill daszes
out onto the road, tries to flag the car down b2:
the driver ignores him and races by, leaving his
exposed and vulnerable as the plane roars in on
him. He dives into a ditch and rolls away as
another series of SHOTS are HEARD and bullets rake
the ground that he has Just occupied.

He gets to his feet, looks about, sees a cornfield
about fifty yards from the highway, glances up a:
the plane making its turn, and decides to make a
dash for the cover of the tall-growing corn.

SHOOTING DOWN FROM A HELICOPTER about one hundrei
feet above the ground, we SEE Thornhill running
towards the cornfield and the plane in pursuit.

SHOOTING FROM WITHIN THE CORNFIELD, we SEE Thoreuill
come crashing in, scuttling to the right and lflis
flat and motionless as we HEAR THE PLANE ZOOM CTIE
HIM NITH A BURST OF GUNPIRE and bullets rip int:
the corn, but at a safe distance from Thornhill.

He raises his head cautiously, gasping for breath
as he HEARS THE PLANE MOVE OFF AND INTO ITS TEEN.

levelling off and starting a run over the corn—
field, which betrays no sign of the hidden Thorn-
hill. Skimming over-the top of the cornstalks. lee
plane gives forth no burst of gunfire now. Instead,
it lets loose thick clouds of poisonous dust whiz:

and its driver runs toward the other men. They
stare, transfixed, at the holocaust. Suddenly,
from behind them, they HEAR the PICK—UP TRUCK'S

turns, and is startled to see his truck being

CAMERA WHIPS to Thornhill, standing in an attitude
of concealment inside the doorway of a darkened

looks quite dishevelled, and his suit would not

the sidewalk and starts walking in the direction
of the Ambassador East.

HOTEL CORRIDOR — Foam FLOOR 119

Thornhill approaches the door to #63, looks up
and down the corridor if for no other reason_
than to indicate to us that he has now become
suspicious, cautious and surreptitious in

matters pertaining to Eve. He puts an ear to

her door, listens hears nothing. He presses

the buzzer and waits. Presently the door opens
and she sees him standing before her. Her _
eyes widen. She is too stunned to say anything.

THORNHILL (pleasantly)
Hello._ __

He goes right past her into the room.

INT. EVE'S HOTEL ROOM 120
Eve turns, stares at Thornhill as she closes
the door behind him. If his back were not to
her, he would see the mixed emotions on her
face - not Just surprise, but overwhelming
relief, too. But relief is not something she
can afford to reveal too strongly, because

that would indicate that there was something

to be relieved about. She is almost completely
controlled by the time Thornhill turns to -
her after a very brief moment in which his
darting glance has taken in the room, and the
open door to the bathroom, and noticed nothing
worthy of apprehension.

THORNHILL
Surprised?

. EVE
Yes.

She stares at him, still shaken.

THORNHILL
No getting rid of mg, is
there? '

Suddenly Eve goes up to him, puts her arms around
him, holds him close and presses her face to
his breast. Is it tenderness and relief, or
merely the need to hide from the double-edged
meaning of his last remark? Thornhill puts his
hands on her, but without aﬁfection. He knows
he is on to something now and he intends to
play it cool. Occasionally his deep down anger
will make him say incautious things he oughtn't
to say if he intends-to disarm the girl - and
Just as occasionally, he will be even warmer
than he intended to-be. he can't help liking
this female a little bit even while he would
-like to slug her. It's because he remembers
last night. It's because, also, she happens

to be of the opposite sex.

glances at it, but makes no move to answer it.

She hesitates uncertainly. The PHONE RINGS AGAIN.

drawer she takes some papers and stuffs them into

the partially open bathroom door from whence comes
Thornhill‘s "singing in the rain."

Her glance falls on Thornhill's belongings. which
he had removed from his pockets. A CLOSER VIEW

Vandamm covered by Thornhill's “R O T“ initialled

it long enough for quick study and puts it down

to the night-table, picks up the memo pad on

Has anyone_ever told you (5)
that you overplay your
various roles rather severely,
Mr. Kaplan? First you're
the outraged Hadison Avenue
man who claims he has been
mistaken for someone else,
Then you play a fugitive
from justice, supposedly
trying to clear his name
of a crime he knows he
didn't commit. And now,
you play the peevish
lover, stung by jealousy
and betrayal.

Seems to me you fellows

We are on Thornhill's back as he stands peering

through binoculars mounted on a pedestal (There

are similar glasses located at many vantage points
_ throughout the park).

THORNHIEL
Suppose they don't come.

Psorsssoa's VOICE (o. s.)
They'll come.

During this we have PULLED BACK To REVEAL the
Professor sitting nearby reading a Rapid Citv
newspaper, his back half-turned away from Thornhill.

THORNRILL {uneasily}
I don't like the way Teddy Roosevelt
is looking at me...

PROFESSOR
He's trying to give you one last
word of caution. Hr. Kaplan: speak
softly, and carry a big stick.

Thornhill leaves the binoculars, starts restlessly past
the Professor to the corner of the terrace, saying:

TRORNHILL
I think he's trying to tell me not to go
rhesush with this hair—brained scheme...

PROFESSOR (mildly) ”'"“
My dear fellow - if you had not made
yourself so damnably attractive to

Miss Kendall that she fell for you-—

THORNHILL (momentarily delighted)
And vice versa.

PROFESSOR
--Our friend Vandamm wouldn't be losing
faith in her loyalty now. It was quite
obvious to him last night that she had
become emotionally involved, worst of all
with a man he thinks is a government agent.

THORNHILL .
Are you trying to tell me - and Teddy
Roosevelt - that I’m irresistIEle?

PROFESSOR (sternly)
I'm trying to remind you that it's
our responsibility to help us restore
or to Vandamm's good graces...
(he sees Thornhill's face cloud over)
...Right up to the moment he leaves the
country tonight.

TRORNHILL (annoyed)
All right. All right.
(he points a finger to remind the
Professor of a previous bargain)
But after tonight...

PROFESSOR (looking away)
My blessings on you both.

Thornhill nods. Then he looks off-screen and reacts
tensely.

THORNHIEL

The Professor's nonchalance vanishes instantly. He gets

up and walks swiftly away. Thornhill looks off again.

Thornhill approaches the building and enters.

INT. BUILDING - (MASTER SCENE) 1&2

Thornhill walks across the lobby to the cafeteria,
a vast room with many tables and enormous windows
through which can be seen the faces of the presidents
in the distance. It is after the lunch hour, and
only half of the tables are occupied. Thornhill
goes over to the steam-table and asks for a cup of
coffee. While waiting for it, he turns and looks
toward the PARKING AREA ENTRANCE to the cafeteria.
No one is coming through there yet. He receives
the cup of coffee and starts toward an unoccupied
table. Just as he arrives at the table, he sees
vandamm, Leonard and Eve enter the cafeteria.

He remains standing until they see him. Then he
sits down. as vandamm and Eve walk towards him.
Leonard sits down at a table near the entrance, as
though he were a sentry standing guard in case of
trouble.

AT THE TABLE 1&3

Vandamm and Eve arrive at the table. Eve has a ﬁ .
strained look. Thornhill contemptuously deignszll‘ “par
even to glance at her. His ignoring of her presence

is his way of demonstrating to Vandamm how bitterly

he despises her. (THORﬂHIlL is now playing a terse.
matter-of-fact ‘KAPLAN“ rather than his usual

protesting self.)

with a sharp incline of the head, dismisses her.
ﬁfight-lipped, Eve turns and walks off towards

noticeable distaste. vandamm sits down, resuming
his deceptively polite manner.

beginning of a high stone wall.

He looks about, then moves along the wall until“

he comes to a pair of heavy iron gates - the only

entrance to the area beyond the wall. The gates

are open. He goes through and sees:

Lloyd Wright tradition set on a rise in the land

at the end of a long driveway. Lights are ablaze.

There is evidence of activity within.

way around to the back. The terrain there is rocky

and slopes sharply down to a level field. The house

ANOTHER ANGLE - WITH THORNHILL 170

He turns around and starts up the slope, moving

to his right towards the side of the house where
the incline is less steep. Just as he reaches the
house, he stops on the alert, as he HEARS THE
SOUND OF AN APPﬁOACHING CAR. He looks off, sees:

POINT OF VIEW 17l

The headlights of the approaching car sweep along
the driveway and then the car itself is Seen
coming around the side of the house and pulling to

a stop in the parking area. It is a small sedan.
The driver gets out. It is Valerian. He is carry—
ing a newspaper. At this moment a side door of the
house opens and a woman walks out to meet Valerian.
It is the housekeeper last seen at the Townsend
estate in Glen Cove. Together, they go toward the
house, noving directly towards Thornhill.

THORNHILL 172

He quickly ducks beneath the cantilevered portion
of the house and hides. He EEARS A DOOR OPENING
AND CLOSING then FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES INSIDE

the floor. Thornhill glances about, then decides
to climb up one of the cantilevers. This will
enable him to get a view of what might be going on
inside the house. All the time that he has been
underneath the house, he has been HEARING A HUMBLE

ANOTHER ANGLE — axe. HOUSE 175

Thornhill appears from beneath the house groping
his way up the diagonal beam of the cantilever and
then climbing up onto the horizontal beam. He is
now outside one of the large windows of the living-
room. A section of the window is open. With
cat-like stealth he moves along the cantilever

She starts up the stairs.

Thornhill watches as Eve goes up to the balcony. _
Leonard stares at her all the way, and Vandamm
peers at hip, sensing hostility in his attitude.
When Eve disappears into one of the bedrooms,
Vandamm addresses Leonard with a trace of
facetiousness.

During the above interchange, Thornhill. will
glance sharply up to his right when he sees

the lights go on in the balcony bedroom window,
and then Eve herself appear for a moment at the
window. Eh; voices in the living—room dwindle

to an unintelligible drone as Thornhill backs

away from the open living-room window toward

the end of the cantilever beam. He is now in a
better position to attract Eve's attention. He
glances about for a pebble to throw but he is too
far above ground to reach one. He takes a coin
from his pocket, glances cautiously towards the
living-room, then looks up and throws the coin

at Eve's window. It hits noisily and falls to the

Leonard peers out of the living—room window to see
the cause of the noise he had heard; Eve continues
to look out of the bedroom window. Thornhill cannot
move out to signal her. Seeing nothing, Eve closes
the window again and walks away.

Thornhill glances toward the living-room window and
his eyes widen:

Leonard has moved away from the window and, with his
back to Vandamm, is taking a gun from his pocket and
placing it on a table near the window as vandamm
talks in b.g., his words unintelligib e.

Thornhill edges up to the window, as Leonard turns
around, the gun concealed on the table behind him.

What truth? I've heard nothing

LEONARD
Call it my woman's intuition if
you will, but I've never trusted
neatness. Neatness is always the
result of deliberate planning.

VANDMM (d ei‘ ens ively)
She shot him in a moment of fear and
anger. You were there. You saw it.

LEONARD (nods)
And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle:
(during the preceding speech, he
picks up the gun, holds it behind
his back and advances further into
the room, the CAMERA FOLLOWING

A. She removed any doubts you might
have had about (what did you call it)

herself a new and urgent reason to
be taken over to the other side with

your mind.

Vandamm manages a laugh, but it is not very convincing.

Suddenly Leonard brings the gun out from behind his
back and points it at the startled Vandamm.

The CAMERA is VERY HIGH, looking down on him. As
the full realization of what this means-sinks

in, the CAMERA SLONLY DESCENDS to examine his
expression, and the ANGLE becomes a BIG READ.
Vandamm's reaction is carefully controlled. He

is too big a man to let Leonard see the humiliation
and anger he feels at having been duped by Eve.

It's an old Gestapo trick. Shoot one

WEBER ANGLE 197

Thornhill backs away from the open window, looks
up at Eve's bedroom. The light is still on.
Inside the living-room Valerian has entered in
b.g. and is receiving instructions from Vandamm.
Leonard has taken up a position near the open
window. Even if he thought it would do any good,
Thornhill would not dare hurl another coin at
Eve's window now. His lips tighten. He makes a
decision, starts to climb up the side of the
house to her room.

The CAMERA FOLLONS HIM as he makes his way pre-
cariously up the side of the house. Eve's window

Thornhill, outside the window stares dejectedly
through the glass then silently works the window
open. He climbs into the room and stands there
for a moment in the semi—darkness catching his
-breath. He looks at his cut hand takes out his
handkerchief and presses it into the bleeding
palm. Then he steps cautiously to the doorway
and looks out over the living-room below. He
cannot see much of the room because of the
balcony, and his unfavorable vantage point. But
he can hear voices:

VANDAMM'S VOICE
How about a little champagne
before we go?

EVE'S VOICE
I‘d love it.

VANDAHH'S VOICE (after he
walks to bar)
It may not be cold enough.

EVE'S VOICE
Over the rocks will be all right.

VANDAMM'S VOICE

Really?
EVE'S VOICE
Sure. ”
VANDAHM'S VOICE

Suddenly Thornhill glances back toward the open
window, alarmed at what he HEARS -- THE FIRST
PAINT DRONE OF AN APPROACHING PLANE. He looks
about desperately, not knowing what to do. His
eyes fall on the handkerchief still held in his
hand. He sees his monogram: "BOT" on the cloth.
He glances toward the doorway, and an idea is
born. He feels in his side pocket and takes out
a match folder. (In an INSERT. we see that the
match folder is the same one he and Eve discussed
at dinner on the train. It bears his personal
trademark: RO”.) He takes a pen from his
pocket, opens the match folder and writes a

Vendamm is turning away from the bar, walking
toward her with a glass of champagne-on-the—rocks
in each hand. He gives her one, and they click
glasses.

VANUAMM

window.

down on the coffee table as the SOUND of the PLANE
GROWS LOUDER. And then she sees the match folder.

She gets to her feet takes a cigarette from the
coffee table, puts it between her lips and takes
up the matches. We are VERY CLOSE as she opens

striking a match and lighting the cigarette.
