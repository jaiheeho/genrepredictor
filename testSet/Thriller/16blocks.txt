BLACKNESS

Too inky and deep to see much. A room of some kind. And the
faint g ow of an alarm clock’s LED reading 6:16

From another room a PHONE RINGS. Muffled TALKING then...

BOOM! A door EXPLODES OPEN, LIGHT eouring into the small
room revealing a WIRY RUSSIAN MAN as eep on a cot. His WILD
HAIRED BROTHER shakes him awake.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAWN

The Russian Brothers exit their shit—hole walk—up dressed in
paint splattered work clothes and clutching mugs of instant
coffee. They get into a Black Econoline Van and drive off...

EXT. SUPPLY STORE

The Black Van idling next to a loading dock, RADIO BLARING.

INT. BLACK VAN

The Russians wait, eyes on the Delivery Door. Cold and
bored, Wiry shakes out a line of crystal meth on the console
and SNORTS it.

A STOCKY, well-dressed MAN emerges from the side entrance,
walks to the Van and drops a large paper bag onto the drivers
lap. Speaks to them in Russian then disappears back inelde.

Wild Hair opens the bag and removes TWO TECH-9 HANDGUNS and
FOUR CLIPS of ammunition. Hands them to his brother who
begins loading them.

Wild Hair JERKS THE VAN onto a Brooklyn Street. The Van
swallowed up by morning traffic...

INT. APARTMENT 4D - SAME TIME

Looking at the front door. Chained, dead bolted and police
locked. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Except the CAT in the FOYER that stares at the door,
mesmerized at something we can't see. It just stares. And
stares.

Then suddenly the fur on it’s back stands on end and it BOLTS
just as...

BOOM! The door EXPLODES inward, BATTERING RAM
DISTINTEGRATING the door jam. HINGES FLYING every which way
as Police BURST inside, WEAPONS DRAWN- Lead team FREEZING,
gﬁggAgropping to their side. CAMERA drifts to the ground to

THREE Shirtless DRUG COURIERS sprawled around a card table
covered with scales, baking soda and baggies. Elaborate
jailhouse tattoos interrupted with well placed bullet holes.

INT. APARTMENT 4D - WIDER
Peeling wallpaper and gated windows covered in tin foil.

Narcotics Officers CANNOVA, PEDERSON and BRIGGS, all mid 30’s
and vital, survey the carnage as SECOND TEAM sweeps the rest
of the place.

Cannova kneels down next to the BODY propped up like a
tailor’s dummy against the wall and c cc 5 the body
temperature.

CANNOVA
Couple hours.
(strands)
He’s cleaning house fellas. Gotta
move DOW .
(turns to Pederson)
Who's downstairs we don't need?

PEDERSON unclips a radio from his belt.

PEDERSON
That’s easy.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY

Both TEAMS huddle outside the apartment, some have
handkerchiefs under their noses.

From up the stairs limps JACK MOSLEY. Mid—49’s, out of _
shape, face flushed from climbing the two flights. A slight
herniated limp to his gate.

Cannova pulls him inside the apartment.

CANNOVA
I need you to baby sit this until
Uniforms get here. Don’t leave
until it’s sealed.

The hard-bodied cop then turns and herds the others towards
the stairs.

Jack stands inside the apartment as the SOUND of both TEAMS
dissipate down the stairs.

He takes out a handkerchief, covers his nose and steps over
one of the bodies. Goes around the room checking the
cabinets. Finally finds a bottle of Cutty Sark under the
sink. Plo s down with it on a decomposing couch, pulls a
DAILY NEW from his back pocket and begins his wait.

EXT. FIFTH PRECINCT a EARLY MORNING

Aging pre—war walk up on the boarder of Chinatown and Little
Italy.

INT. PRECINCT LOBBY
UNIFORMS, PAA's and a few CIVILIANS looking for justice.

Jack walks in past the TS {Telephone and Sign—Out) Desk .
heading for the stairs, slightly buzzed. Passing the waist
high Sergeants Desk manned y a Uniformed SERGEANT.

SERGEANT
Big Jack’s in the house... Hey the
Loo’s looking for you.

ANTI-CRIME DIVISION - MORNING

Fluorescent—lit room with oor ventilation and rows of
government—issue metal des 5. All of which are filled with
COPS typing 5’s (case reports), taking statements or
interViewing witnesses and perps. LOUD and CHAOTIC.

GRACE, a large Hispanic woman and the Units PAA (Police
Administrative ASSistant), fields calls at a reception desk.

Jack saunters over and leans in close.

JACK
When are you going to run away with
me Gracie?

Grace reaches into her top drawer and slides a box of Tic
Tacs towards Jack, never coking up.

GRACE
How's Thursday looking for ya.

JACK
Bad. Got a colonoscopy scheduled.
Anytime after that.

GRACE

Ser eant Cannova called in. Twice.
Won ered where you’ve been. Needs
you to write up a wire request.

(hands him a paper)
Themfs the particulars. Said to
make sure you put the right dates
on this one.

Jack ignores the remark and pops a breath mint.

JACK
He say when they needed it?

GRACE
Said you can get it signed on your
way in tomorrow.

Jack’s relieved. Stretches.

JACK
Where does the time go...

GRACE
And the Lieutenant’s looking for
you. Been up twice already. Said
to find him right away.

Jack eyes the clock above her. 7:54

INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY

LIEUTENANT KINCAID, young, freshly laundered and all attitude *
pops up the stairs and down the hall in his crisp blue
UNIFORM. Strides into Anti—Crime. *

Jack slips out of the COFFEE ROOM and down the stairs like a *
kid without a hall pass. *

PRECINCT LOBBY - MORNING

Jack stands behind SEVERAL other COPS waiting to sign out,
wishing the line to move faster. Looking into the bull en
with its OVERWORKED COPS and the incessant RINGING of p ones. *
Jack’s eyes drifting to an ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN, sitting

alone on a scarred mahogany bench. clutching some personal
belongings, face numb. A sudden widow.

3(-

She’s escorted by some DETECTIVES to an interview room, no
one seeing PAGES of her dog eared photo album slip behind the
bench.

Jack looks away, walks up to the sign—out desk, grabs the
pen... then drops it.

INT. BULLPEN

Jack digs the album pages out from behind the bench and calls
a UNIFORM over. Hands them to him, pointing to the interview
room. Ste 5 back into the lobb and walks back to the TS

desk, reac es for the pen... w an another band snatches it

away.

LIEUTENANT KINCAID stands there holding the pen. *
KINCAID

Grace tell you to find me?

JACK |
Don’t remember. Been dealing with
a ton of shit.

Kincaid barely hides his disdain. Holds out a folder.

KINCAID
Get this guy from lock—up and take
him to Centre Street. DA needs him
ASAP. He’s got to be in front of a
Grand Jury before ten.

JACK
I’m off the clock, Loo.

. KINCAID
You Sign that sheet?

Jack wants to kick himself.

JACK
Don't you have some regular mutt
doin’ this?

KINCAID
Can’t find him.

JACK
C’mon Loo, I’ve been on all night.
Give it to Cibelli or Meadows.
They’re on light duty.

KINCAID
Cibelli and Meadows are bus doing
police work. This is a not ing
assignment Jack. One guess why the
Captain picked you.

JACK
You were too busy?

KINCAID
Fuck you. Were up to me I’d have
you driving blood sam les to state
ab or reorganizing t e filing
cabinets for the gambling squad.

Kincaid slaps the folder into Jack’s hand, checks his watch.

KINCAID (cont’d)
A hundred and ei hteen minutes to
take this hemorr oid sixteen
blocks. Even you can handle this
one.

HOLDING CELLS " PRECINCT BASEMENT

Massive steel bars set in turn of the century cinder block
Slt at the end of a long concrete hallway.

6.

A caged-in Watch Room is to the left. Behind it sits 8 jail
cells and a holding tank.

Jack walks to the window but there's no one behind it. Bangs
on the cage.

JACK
Yo!

A CORRECTIONS OFFICER, bloated and bored looking, shuffles
out of a back toilet buckling his pants.

CORRECTIONS OFFICER
Excuse me for taking a shit.

Jack shoves the pick up slip through a slot in the cage
without a word. The Officer grabs it and waddles back
towards the cells.

Waiting Jack flips open the folder. Edward Bunker.
Underneath a long list of arrests and dates. B and E's
mostly. All petty shit. Just a lot of it. CLANGING of the
steel door opening makes Jack turn. The Corrections Officer
slides his paper back through the slot.

CORRECTIONS OFFICER (Cont'd)
Come back in an hour.

JACK
Hour? What for?

INT. CELL BLOCK

The thick steel door of cell number 6 rolls open and reveals
EDDIE BUNKER, frin e player and all around fuck up sitting in
his underwear. Mi 2 ’5, he appears quite comfortable li e
this.

CORRECTIONS OFFICER (OS)
Supposed to wear a suit when he
leaves.

Jack looks to Eddie.

EDDIE
Grey one. Two buttons, cuffs on
the pants.

JACK
And?

CORRECTIONS OFFICER
Not here yet.

Jack walks over to Eddie.

JACK
Get dressed.

Eddie hesitates.

EDDIE
I’m supposed to have a suit. It
was part of the arrangement.

Jerks Eddie to his feet.

JACK
New arrangement. Cause I’ m not
waiting an hour for a fucking grey
suit.

CELL BLOCK — MINUTES LATER

Eddie steps out of the cell in his street clothes. Clown
sized jeans, Hilfiger olo shirt and Korean sneakers. He
clutches a ratty Schoo Composition notebook in one hand and
has a look of grave disapp01ntment.

EDDIE
That suit’s kinda important to me.

Jack ignores Eddie and CUFFS him. A WIZENED FACE pushes his
head against the bars of the opposite cell and loo
pleadingly at Eddie.

FACE

You take the old lady right? Is
that it, kid? The o d lady?

Eddie shrugs as Jack pulls him down the tomb—like hallway.

FACE (cont’d)
What’s the ANSWER!

PRECINCT LOBBY - MORNING

Jack signs out a vehicle then pushes Eddie towards the double
doors. Mixing in with UNIFORMS filing out in pairs to start
their shifts.

A FRESH— FACED UNIFORM going against the flow, presses his way
inside, suit bag over his shoulder. Eddie pul s u p, about to
say something but Jack yanks him out the door, Eddie looking

back as his suit disappears into a sea of blue.

EXT. FIFTH PRECINCT — BAXTER STREET

The curb jammed with Black and Whites and unmarked Police
cars, Jack pulls Eddie down the sidewalk, checking key tag
against license plates.

Eddie noticing the hitch in Jack’s walk.

EDDIE
Got a little limp there.

Jack keeps walking in stony silence, the shrunken blood
vessels in his head starting to throb. Unlocks the back door
of a crap—brown Impala and shoves Eddie’s head down and
through the door.

INT. IMPALA

Standard issue with a sliding fiberglass partition separating
front from back, which is open. Eddie settles in.

EDDIE
These cars never chan e. Same
drive shaft hump in t e middle.
Same smell. Pinesol and wet dog.

Jack pops the car in gear throwing Eddie back against the
seat e ore he can finish.

EXT. BAXTER STREET

Jack hangs a right and lurches into the morning rush hour
traffic.

INT. IMPALA

Jack flips down the visor and weaves the car towards West
Broadway. Sneaks a look at Eddie in the rearview. Kid
scribbling something in his book.

Cutting cars off trying to make the light.

Which he doesn’t. Gridlock at Baxter and West Broadway puts
the Impala at a dead stop. The LED clock on the dash reading

8:06

They sit in silence for a minute. Eddie’s mind whirring
away. Leans forward.

EDDIE
You're driving along in a
hurricane. You pass a bus stop
with three people waitin there. An
old lady who’s about to die, our
best friend who saved your li e
once and the woman of your dreams.
You only have room to take one.
What do you do?

Jack TURNS UP THE RADIO pretending he didn’t hear it.

EDDIE (cont’d)
It’s an ancient question that’s
supposed to tell you what kind of
person you are inside.
(beat)
Who do you take?

Jack HITS THE ACCELERATOR and hangs a sharp left down a small
alley. Weaving around delivery trucks and Sanitation bins,
tos51ng Eddie back and forth across the seat. Cuts across
a...

PARKING LOT

In and around COMMUTERS pulling in. Getting familiar waves
from the ATTENDANTS as Jack maneuvers the car onto...

EXT. MULBERRY STREET - MORNING

Awnings being unfurled, pushcarts line the curb. HEAVYSET
MEN 1n Bermu as's and go d chains set up folding chairs
outside mobbed-up restaurants.

The Impala slipping into traffic.

INT. IMPALA

Jack looks back at Eddie through the mirror, the kid still
waiting for an answer.

EDDIE
The old lady, right? I mean she
won’t make it if ou leave her.
But that sounds o vious.

Kid’s not going give up.
JACK

I wouldn’t drive in a hurricane so
it doesn’t apply to me.

EDDIE
It’s hypothetical. Pretend.

JACK
I don’t have to. So shut up.

EDDIE
lbeat)

They say your soul’s not intact
until you know the answer.

Okay

Eddie sits back and looks out the window, pondering the
estion. Oblivious to his circumstances. Which ugs Jack
or some reason.

JACK
What’d they give you?

EDDIE
Give me?

lO.

JACK
Must’ve out yourself a sweet deal
Sittin’ there all comfy like.

EDDIE
Oh. Dropped the charges. And a
suit. Which I didn't get thanks to

you.
JACK
That’s cheap to rat to a grand
jury.
EDDIE

It’s all I wanted. And I’m not a
rat. I'm a conduit of information.
That’s what they said.

JACK
Yeah? Well if it looks like a rat
and squeals like a rat...

Eddie thinks for a minute.

EDDIE
Could be a Vole. They look like
rats from far away. Then you get
closer and you realize it isn’t
one.

Jack stares at the kid then pushes through a yellow light
taking a right onto Lafayette. Never notiCing the Black
Econo ine van staying close behind them.

EXT. LAFAYETTE STREET — EARLY MORNING

PEDESTRIANS in rush mode fill the sidewalk. Bodegas roll out
carts of fruit and greens. Grill work is rolled up as
businesses OPEN.

INT. IMPALA

Jack looking impatient. Eyes searching the sidewalks for
something. Eddie SEES the top of a MASSIVE GRANITE BUILDING
12 blocks away.

EDDIE
That it?

Jack ignores him. Spots what he’s looking for.

EDDIE (cont'd)
If you knew all the craz stuff
that happened to me in t_e past
couple months... ‘See I just never
watched for the Signs. Never knew
to look for ‘em.

(MORE)

ll.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Then when I started, everything
fell into place. Even when it made
no sense. Like yesterday. All

bad.

(beat)
But I’m right where I'm supposed to
be. You believe that?

Jack double parks the Impala on the west side of the street
and shuts off the engine.

JACK
I believe life’s too fucking long
and guys like you make it even
longer.

Starts to get out.

EDDIE
Where ya going?

Eddie looks acrose the street at the Liquor Store then to the
dashboard clock.

8:09

EDDIE (cont’d)
I got an appointment after court.
Gotta be t ere by noon.

JACK
You’ll get there.

Eddie watches Jack fumble around in his pockets for some
cash.

EDDIE
Yon’re not the regular guy who does
this, are you?

JACK
First time. How am I doing?
EDDIE
I don’t think you're supposed to
stop.
JACK

No? Gee, I better check m witness
escort handbook. Oops, I orgot
it. Oh well...

Jack gets out. Leans back in.

JACK (cont’d)
When you get to the courthouse you
can fill out one of those cards and
rate your travel experience with
the NYPD.

SLAMS the door.

12.

EXT. LAFAYETTE STREET

Jack LOCKS the Impala and crosses the busy street into a
Liquor store. The Black Econoline Van drifting past and
disappearing around the corner.

INT. CHINESE LIQUOR STORE

Small and cramped with too many aisles and too many stacked
boxes. Jack limping towards t e back and grabbing a bottle
of Puerto Rican Rum and a bag of nuts.

INT. IMPALA

Eddie stares out his window then checks the dashboard clock.
Edgy all of a sudden.

EDDIE
He’s not the right guy.

Not_sensing the Black Econoline van pulling up directly_
behind the Impala, throwing a shadow through the back Window.

INT. CHINESE LIQUOR STORE

Jack moving to the register. A middle—aged CHINESE MAN and
his WIFE behind it.

Jack exchanging pleasantries with them in broken Chinese.
The WIFE laughing and correcting him. Showing Jack a picture
of her daughter.

EXT. LAFAYETTE STREET

The Van’s doors open and the two Russians step out into the
street. Both holding canvas bags. The Wiry one hanging by
the Van, eyeing the cot traffic. Wild Hair moving to the

street side of the Impala.

INT. CHINESE LIQUOR STORE

The Chinese man bagging Jack’s breakfast while the Wife makes
change. Jack about to leave when the Chinese Man beckons him
towards the back...

INT. IMPALA — SAME TIME

Eddie Bunker looks around trying to see where the hell Jack
is. Checks the clock again. S ides to the passenger door
and tries to open it. NO DOOR HANDLE. Starts over the
pargition when then HEARS a TAPPING on the street—side

win ow.

l3.

Falls back to see some WILD HAIRED Russian Man peering _
inside. Smiling as he motions Eddie to roll down the window.
Eddie sliding over and looking for the button.

INT. CHINESE LIQUOR STORE

Jack being shown the 'immied lock on the back delivery door
to the store. Empty iquor cartons lay nearby. Jack |
explaining something in Chinese and motioning to the security
monitor over the register.

INT. IMPALA

Eddie gestures to the Russian to try the door. HEARING
SHOUES, turning to see the Wiry Russian SCREAMING at his
rot er.

Looking back in time to see the TECH—9 PRESSED TO THE GLASS.
BLAM!
Only the glass doesn’t shatter.

Instead itis SPATTERED WITH BLOOD, HAIR AND BRAIN MATTER.
What's left of the RuSSian’s face slides away revealing Jack,
his gun barrel still smoking half—way across the street.

EXT. LAFAYETTE - SIMULTANEOUS

Jack stands in the middle of the street, gun hand shaking.
Tunnel vision and audio collapse washing over him. Not
hearing the PEDESTRIAN SCREAMS or BRAKES SQUEAL around him...

Nor seeing the Wiry Russian coming from around the Van
raising his Tech—9 until it’s too late...

Turning just in time to HEAR the CHAMBER EXPLODE... the exact
moment a skidding TAXI SIDESWIPES the Russian knocking the
shot a millimeter off line.

PEDESTRIANS and SHOPKEEPERS scatter as the bullet SHATTERS a
plate glass window.

Jack charging toward the Impala. Knees pumpin like out of
sync pistons as the Wiry Russian gets to his eat, too high
and too crazed to register pain. Leveling the machine
pistol and BLASTING AWAY...

INT. IMPALA

Jack bellying through the door as bullets thud sickeningly
close to his ear. A cacophony of metal chunks being
disgorged echo around him. Not noticing his 9mm bouncing to
the pavement...

14.

Eddie hugging the back floorboards.

EDDIE
WHAT’S HAPPENING?!

Jack beneath the steering wheel, fumbling for the RADIO.I
Dropping it as SLIVERS OF GLASS RAIN DOWN ON HIM. Reaching
up and turning the key. Heart hammering through his ribs.

Gets the key in the ignition and throws the Impala in
reverse, pressing his hand on the accelerator... The Impala
SLAMMING INTO THE Russian, knocking him.six feet...

Jack up into the drivers seat, throws it into drive and
accelerates towards Spring Street.

EXT. IMPALA

Russian FIRING FROM THE GROUND, bullets PELTING THE REAR
TIRES. The car leaking fuel and spewing smoke. Sputtering
onto Spring Street.

INT. IMPALA
Rolling to a stop half—way up the block...

Jack trying to locate the Russian through cracked windows and
smoke. PEOPLE obscuring his vision. Grabbing for his gun
and realizing it’s gone.

KICKS OPEN THE PASSENGER DOOR, Stays low and RIPS OPEN THE
BACK DOOR. Eddie Bunker balled up on the floor, clutching
his book. Pulls the kid onto the sidewalk as the street
swims with PEOPLE and movement.

JACK AND EDDIE — MOVING

Across the sidewalk and down a service alley as fast as
Jack’s bad leg can take them... Coming out into another
alley... E es trying to focus, operating on pure instinct.
Spotting t e Van on Lafayette, doors open and no one
inside... The crazy RUSSlan out here somewhere...

Over a small cinder block wall and into a...

SMALL PARKING LOT - MULBERRY STREET

Dozens of cars packed like sardines in between two buildings.
Jack and Eddie stumbling over hoods and bumpers. Jack
pulling Eddie into the...

15.

INT. PARKING KIOSK

Just off the sidewalk. Cramped makeshift office with a gated
window and door-less entrance. Jack grabbing the rotary
p one.

FREEZING when he spots HIM coming fast across the street. .
Backlit by the riSing sun. Hand already reaching behind his
back, the skinny MAN zeroed in on Jack.

Pushing Eddie to the floor as the Man pulls his hand from
behind his back and aims... a parking ticket in Jack’s face.

MAN
I'm the tan Caddy.

EXT. MULBERRY STREET

Jack pulls Eddie across the street, adrenaline surging.
Hitting the sidewalk and heading south.

Jack suddenly realizing that Eddie is gone. Turning to see
Eddie running back towards the commotion-

Cars swerving around the kid. Jack heading after him,
screaming.

Eddie stopping to avoid a taxi, Jack just about there when
Eddie bends dOwn and retrieves the notebook he dropped.

JACK
Are you fucking nuts!

Jack yanks Eddie to the side walk. Trying to get his
bearings. A BIKE MESSENGER whizzing by makes Jack flinch,
the BUSINESS MAN reaching into his riefcase... Suddenly
EVERYONE looks like a potential killer.

DELIVERY ALLEY

Moving in and around the DELIVERY TRUCKS delivering produce,
meats and liquor. Jack trying shake the fuzziness. Trying
to remember what to do...

BOOM! A door bursts open! Jack SPINNING... THREE CHINESE
BUSBOYS dumping steaming water into the alley. Every
movement, every sound is heightened.

Jack still searching...Eddie humming to himself now. Jack

watching the signs above gated back entrances... Then

tgpdin it. Jerking Eddie through the back door of Number
an into—

16.

INT. STORAGE ROOM

Jammed with liquor boxes piled too high to be safe. The
ALARM wailing... Jack pushing Eddie towards a curtained
doorway when suddenl a baseball bat flies through it,
misaing JackJs head by millimeters, smashing into a crate of
Mar ot.

Jack grabbing the bat and pulling DOMINIC FORLINI, the white—
haire 77 year old bar owner through it. Surprised and
shocked by the sight of Jack.

FORLINI
Jesus Jackie I thought it was kids.

JACK
Look it.

INT. DOMINIC’S — EARLY MORNING

A tiny drinker's hideaway on the edge of Little Italy. Red
nau a yde booths, kidney shaped bar with two Espresso
mac ines.

Jack to the wall phone, knowing right where it is. Shaky
fingers dialing...

JACK
This is officer Jack Mosley, badge
227. I am.lO—l3, one—three—three
Mulberry. Officer is plainclothes,
green 5 irt, black slacks. I have
male prisoner, 24, white polo
shirt, sneakers. We are under
fire. Perp is in white overalls
with automatic weapon...

DISPATCHER (OS)
Roger 10—13, 1—3—3 Mulberry—.

Jack hangs up as Dominic shuffles in, seeing the blood caking
above Jack’s left eye.

FORLINI
Jackie what’s going on? You——

But Jack is moving again. Pointing to the illegal BUSBOYS as
he crosses the room.

JACK
Get ‘em out of here! You too.

Forlini herds them out the front door. Jack dragging Eddie
hard into a booth along the far wall.

JACK (cont’d)
They said you were a nobody!

l7.

EDDIE
I am] I swear! I don’t under——

Jack roughly hauls Eddie out of the booth and across the
room. . .

JACK
Rats like you turn my stomach.
You people don't give a shit who
gets covered with your garbage.

EDDIE
This is a mis——

Jack throws him into a booth left of the door and underneath
a large window.

JACK
Bottom feeders like you would rat
your own mother it meant saving
your own ass.

Jack reaches up and pulls the curtains closed, PLUNGING THE

BAR INTO EVEN GREATER DARKNESS. Operating on sheer instinct.
Rust and cobwebs showing...

BOOTH
Jack drops in hard and angry.

JACK
Shoulda let them kill you...

Eddie’s body still trembling, hands wrapped tightly around
his noteboo .

. EDDIE
I’m just supposed to—
JACK
Not another syllable.
The SOUND of brakes SCREECHING TO A HALT outside. Jack parts

the curtain a sliver. UNIFORMED PATROLMEN JUMPING from their
blue and whites...

Relief spreads through Jack. Pulse dropping. Crosses to the
bar and pours a Johnny Walker as Eddie peers through the
curtain.

EDDIE'S POV

As two Unmarked Cars pull up. Patrolmen turning as MEN in
SUITS ex1t their vehicles f ashing gold shields...

IS.

BOOTH

Eddie stares unblinkingly at the largest suit in particular,
face going pale.

Jack looks up from the bar to see Eddie sliding under the
table... BOOM! The front door explodes open.

INT. DOMINIC'S - WIDER

Homicide Detective FRANK NUGENT is inside before Jack can
move.

Detectives JIMMY MULVEY AND ROBERT TORRES right behind,
spreading out across the room, movements routine and
precise.

The back ALARM SOUNDING then shutting off. Detective JERRY
SHUE, steps through the back curtain, EXIT light above
bouncing off his lue—black toupee. Gives Nugent the all
clear Sign, and everybody holsters their weapons.

Mulvey’s thin, a hawk—like nose and hooded eyes. Torres
short and compact. A fire hydrant with feet. Hard—ass guys.

Nugent looks at Jack with a shit—eating grin. A large man
who doesn't inhabit the room, he consumes it. Older than
Jack, but vital. The eyes and arrogance of Ted Williams.

NUGENT
Shit hits the fan and he's standing
there with a drink in his hand.
Like it was nothing.
(beat)
God I miss this bastard.

The others snicker. Jack looking around confused.

NUGENT (cont’d)
We were two blocks over when the
call went out. Heard it was you,
we made like the friggin’ cavalry.

Reaches across the bar and slaps his meaty hand on Jack’s
shoulder.

NUGENT (cont’d)
Long time Jack.

UNDER THE TABLE

Eddie taking small, silent breaths. His view obscured by
tables and chairs. He eyes the door to his left when
Torres’s stump legs ate in front of him. Eddie freezes any
movement, notegook clutc ed to his chest. Trying to find a
sign in this...

19.

DOMINIC’S - WIDER

All eyes on Nugent as he bellies up to the bar. Relaxed and
confident.

NUGENT
Big mess out there Jack. You
didn’t lose the wit, did ya?

JACK
No. He's safe.

NUGENT
Good man. Where is he?

Jack hesitates. Somethin ’s not right about this. But he’s
unable to keep his eyes 0 f the booth near the door. All
eyes shift across the room. Eddie Bunker slowly rising from
beneath the table. Eyes looking into Nugent's. A flicker of
recognition and fear. Jack loo ing from Eddie to Nugent.

Eddie BOLTS for the door but Mulvey and Torres grab him._
Nugent casually sits on a bar stoo as his guys drag Eddie
across the room.

NUGENT (cont’d)
How you been, Jack? Heard you’ve
been to the farm.

Jack looking down at his drink.

JACK
Twice. Working a strong program
now.

Nugent smiles as Jack knocks it back.

NUGENT
You believe that mutt Gruber made
Captain? Told me you hooked up
with Cannova's unit. Supposed to
be a good bunch of guys.

Jack’s half listening. Watching Mulvey throw the kid in the
corner and pat him down.

JACK
He’s clean.

Mulvey looks back at Jack, grins, and keeps patting.
NUGENT
Still with what’s her name? The
newspaper lady?

JACK
Not for a while now.

20.

Jack seeing MUIvey now uncuff Eddie and hold him while Torres
pulls a Saturday night special from his ankle and presses it
into Eddie’s shaking hand, then lets it drop to the floor.

Nugent looks back to his guys then to Jack.

NUGENT
Cocksucker was gonna testify
against Ryan. You remember him
from Narcotics. Part of my team
DOW .
(beat)

Dick’ll roll over they indict him.
And I can't have that. His shit’s
gonna Open some closets I can’t

ave opened. Some go way back.

Suddenl Jack’s whole demeanor changes. Like he’s been
slappe out of a deep, medicated sleep.

NUGENT (cont'd)
The whole thing caught us unaware.
You were a last minute thin on
this. Supposed to be Teach s
nephew driving him. That’s his
thing. Who nows where the fuck
he went. So Gruber pegged you.

(laughs)
Never figured you’d cap one of ‘em.
Fuckin' ussians. That's what you

get when you hire drug addicts.

Across the room, Torres holds the thrOw down gun with his
handkerchief and fires a single shot into the far wall.
Mulvey with his foot on Eddie’s chest.

NUGENT (cont’d)
I figure it this way. You pop the
guys trying to spring the rat
bastard but the itt e shit gets
your gun. Takes you hostage. We
come in and save the day. He dies
you live.

Like ordering a sandwich. Waits for Jack to process it.
Eyeing him like a father would the wayward son.

NUGENT (cont’d)
Shit, maybe yon get a medal. Get
your life straightened out. Get
you back where you belong. This
could be a good thing Jack.

Torres nods to Nugent. They’re ready.

NUGENT (cont’d)
You want to stay for it?

Jack doesn't move. Looks around the rooms Mulvey to his
left. Torres on the right. Shue dead center. Now looks at
Eddie. Body trembling, eyes pleading with Jack.

21.

Eyes falling to his drink. Staring into it like there might
be an answer there, self loathing washing over his face.
Nugent’s run out of patience and stands.

NUGENT (cont’d)
Make yourself useful. Pour us a
couple of drinks.

Nugent crosses the room and nods to Shue. Jack turns his
back, unable to watch. Reaching for the Chivas when he
catches Jerry Shue in the mirror, eyeefucking Jack with a
shit—eating grin as he takes out his .38

Torres and Mulvey move away from Eddie. Shue aiming the
gun...

BLAM!

The SOUND is DEAFENING. Jack pulling the trigger on the
sawedwoff Shotgun that was under the bar, BLOWING Jerry
Shue's left kneecap into tiny fragments. Swinging and
racking at the same time, both barrels leveled at Frank
Nugent s heart, arms a little shaky.

Torres and Mulvey, weapons still holstered, freeze. Dead
silence. Every BREATH, every CREAK magnified. The writhing,
unnatural MOANS of Jerry Shue the only SOUND.

Frank_Nugent doesn’t blink. stares right down the barrel of
Dominic Forlini’s taped up shotgun. You’d swear his heart
never skipped a beat.

NUGENT (coht'd)
That changes everything Jack.

Jack moves around in front of the bar, shotgun rising to
Nugent’s head.

NUGENT (cont’d)
Jury’s tenure ends at ten. That
kid gets there a minute past and
all this doesn’t matter. Ryan
walks. All you have to do is look
the other way.

JACK
Eddie.

Eddie hustles across the room and behind Jack. Jack backing
the both of them towards the rear door.

NUGENT
I can't help you once you walk out
that door.

Jack stepping over Jerry Shue, eyeballs rolling back in his
head like an Atlantic City slot. Eddie disappearing through
the curtain. Jack holding Nugent’s stare, trying to hold it
together.

22.

Then he’s gone.

Torres and Mulvey grabbing their weapons. Mulvey moving to
Jerry- Torres out the back door. Nugent looking down at
Jerry Shue with no emotion, pulling his cell. Eyeing the
neon clock over the bar

8:18

NUGENT (cont'd)

Get him to a hospital. Make sure
he knows to keep his mouth shut for
now. Nobody outside this room
knows an thing.

(dia in is cell)
And stay of your radios. We know
where he’s g01ng so this shouldn't
be hard.

EXT. DELIVERY ALLEY

Moving with Jack and Eddie underneath scaffolding, past an
empty loading dock to a set of cement steps leading to a sub—
basement door. Jack shaken...

JACK
What the fuck did you see? TELL
ME.

EDDIE

That big guy in there and his
friend, t e one whose picture the
DA showed me. I saw t em telling
some Puerto Rican dude to get lost
or they were gonna carve u his
kIIS- Threatening him. T at’s

a .

Jack’s mind beginning to clear.

INT. BASEMENT — CHINESE LAUNDRY

Dripping steam pipes feed a dozen industrial washers and
dryers. Sweltering, oppressive heat. CHINESE WORKERS sort
and fold on both sides of a long cafeteria tables.

Down a dark cinder block passageway. Jack finding a drainage
grate, dropping the shotgun into it.

EDDIE
Don’t we need that?

JACK
Had one shell in it for twenty
years. Lucky it went off.

Eddie staring at the drainage grate like it means something.

23.

DELIVERY ALLEY — SAME TIME

Torres, thick and massive, moves with the methodical
concentration of a panther stalking its prey.

INT. CHINESE LAUNDRY

Street level. Jack pulling Eddie out of the service elevator
and towards the door, badge in the air for the surprised
OWNER to see. Calming him in halting Chinese.

Stepping next to a SEAMSTRESS working in the window, peering
out. No black van. No Russian. No Police...

Jack unlocks Eddie’s cuffs. Whips off his shirt, tossing it
away. Just a T—shirt now. Hands Eddie a shirt from a
cleaning bin.

JACK
Put this on.

Then hands him a hanger of dry cleaning.

JACK (cont’d)
Walk slow. Like ou know where
you’re going. I’l be right behind
you.

EXT. WEST BROADWAY - MORNING

Eddie steps into the street and starts South, Jack three
steps behind, the two weaving through the crowds. Eddie, dry
cleaning bag slung over his shoulder, hugging the shadows of
the bui ding faca es. Jack’s eyes darting everywhere.

PATROL CARS from Mid—Town South, lst and the 5th cruise by
from Side streets. None of it seems to bother Eddie, wal ing
down West Broadway with a coolness in his step.

JACK
They didn't tell you Ryan was a
cop, did they?

EDDIE
I 'ust saw his picture on the
tagle. They never said he was
police.

JACK
Well you’re about to rat out the
top Homicide detective in the New
York City police de artment. Bet
that's worth more t an a suit.

Crossing Grand Street now, blending in with the foot traffic.
Getting lost in a sea of faces... The Courthouse eleven
blocks away. The clock on the MONY BUILDING steeple flashing

24.

8:21

EXT. GRAND STREET — SAME TIME

Frank Nugent stands in the doorway of a boarded up
Restaurant, hands in his pockets. One by one UNMARKED CARS
pull up and stocky MEN eXit the vehicles. Some in SUITS,
others in WINDBREAKERS and JEANS. WEAPONS jammed in the back
of ants and in Shoulder holsters. These are hard,

unf inching COPS.

Wefre too far away to HEAR but it’s obvious Nugent is
briefing them. No small talk either. The facts, the deal
and that’s it. They break as quickly as they got there.

Just as an OFFICIAL CAR pulls to the curb. Out of it steps
DANIEL GRUBER, Captain of the 5th and very pissed. Again
we’re too far away to hear what's being said. But Nugent
seems to be a calming influence.

They walk toward us and slowly we begin to hear...

NUGENT
... put out descriptions over
precinct channels. No names. Or
that one’s a cop. It’ll help to
have some eyes.
(beat)
How long can you sit on this?

GRUBER
He shot a cop for Christsakes.

NUGENT .
You’re the Precinct Captain, Dan.
How long?

GRUBER
Hour. Ma be a little more.
Who’s on t is with you?

NUGENT
My guys. Ortiz and Maldonado from
t e SlX—Six. Touhey and Keller
from the one—eleven. A couple of
others you don't want to know
about. I’ve called in all favors.

Gruber stares into the busy streets.

GRUBER
Guy can’t tie his shoe without
fa ling down suddenly he’s a
cowboy. What's that about?

NUGENT
I woke him up. That was my
mistake.

(MORE)

25.

NUGENT (cont'd)
He’ll probably do what he always
does and we can all go back to
work.

GRUBER
And if he doesn’t?

NUGENT
These are his streets, Dan. I want
to quash this thing before he gets
his legs back.
(beat)
It’ll get u ly for the six of us if
that kid talks.

EXT. WEST BROADWAY

Jack and Eddie approaching Brooms, foot traffic thinning.
Eddie walking more relaxe . Jack just off his left shoulder.

Eddie slowing to look in store windows as they go.

JACK
Pick it up.

EDDIE
You said go easy.

_ JACK
I’m saying go faster now.

Jack searching for a cab now.

EDDIE

Slow, fast. You have no idea what

you’re doing, do you?
(beat)

I’m sure you have your good
qualities. But ever since I met
you, nothing’s gone right. So I

ave to consider the possibility
that I'm.with the wrong guy. I
mean look at you. Out 0 reath,
hungover, and a le that’s gonna
give out any secon . You were a

orse, they d shoot ya. No
offense.

JACK
None taken. Coming from a guy
who's spent half his adult i e in
the joint.

EDDIE
I cease and desisted being that guy
a while ago.

JACK
Sure you did.

26.

Passing a DUANE REED and a window of CLOCKS. Eddie staring
at_the time:

8:25

EDDIE

Look. This is a big day for me. I
need to be at a certain place by
noon or I can’t get what I’m
destined to have. And in order to
get there by noon I have to be

inished in court by ten. I can’t
be late.

Jack's not hearing a thing. Eyes now searching the streets-
Start of the day FOOT TRAFFIC making it hard to spot trouble.

Suddenly realizing Eddie’s not talking and looks back.
GONE.

Head SPINNING in every direction. Nothing. Then a TAPPING
SOUND on glass. Sees Eddie waving from inside...

INT. CAMMERANO’S BAKERY

Ricotta Cheesecakes, cannoli shells, sheets of Prato cookies
fill display cases. White cake boxes with customer names
stacked against the back wall. FAT ITALIAN WOMEN with their
stockings rolled down picking up orders from MAMA CAMMERANO.

BELLS above the door RINGING as Jack slides into the crowded
store and hovering near the front window watching the street
scene unfold. COPS in BLUE fanning out across West Broadway.

EDDIE
When you go in for your leg, get
your eyes checked too.

Jack watches their movements over the to of Wedding Cakes.
Eddie sliding to the cake display near t e back, captivated
by the elaborate cakes. GRANDMA CAMMERANO eyes him
suspic1ously.

EDDIE (cont’d)
You make all these here?

Insulted, Grandma spits something in Italian and gestures
towards the back.

INT. BAKERY BACK ROOM

Steel tables and racks of delicacies. LARGE MEN hand stir
large vats of batter and pull freshly baked bread from brick
ovens. Against the far wall a beautiful 19 year old ITALIAN
GIRL meticulously decorates a sheet cake. At least attempts
to.

27.

Mama Cammerano’s son, ALFONSE (40’s) leans against her,

pressing his sweaty body against hers, pretending to be

interested in her artwork, furry hands smoothing out her
apron in inappropriate places.

Suddenly Eddie’s face appears over his shoulder.

EDDIE
Never seen a border like that.
Very inventive. You do all the
cakes here?

Alphonse has to step away. The Girl looks at Eddie, a shy,
but dazzling smile of thanks.

ALFONSEI
She speak no English. Who you be?
You inspector?

EDDIE
That’s right. FDA approved. This
here is a spot check.
(holds up notebook)
gongt make me put you down in my
00 .

Eddie looks around the place then starts around the table,
picking up an icing tube as he goes. Slowly strolls behind
Alphonse, making t e man nervous, appearing on the other
side.

EDDIE (cont'd)
When’s the last time you
disinfected your utensils? Or
those guys had showers? Huh?
Better get your act together my
man .

Alfonse is flustered and strides towards the front. Only now
do we see the back of his jacket. The word ASS scripted out
in powder blue icing. The Italian girl stifling her GIGGLE.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Well he is.
(beat)
You don’t need have to put up with
that crap. Sue him for harassment.
Besides, ou got talent. You could
work anyp ace. And I should know.

BAKERY WINDOW

Jack seeing Torres appear on the block. Walking towards
several of the UNIFORMS. Talking with them. Suddenly ALL
EYES looking right into the Bakery.

BAKERY BACK ROOM

Eddie showing the girl a page in his book.

28.

EDDIE
.. this one’s kinda elaborate.
So I seal it first with a glaze.
Gives ou a stronger canvas. Then
I use utter cream instead of
shortening.

She’s not looking at the page. Just at Eddie. Not
understanding a thing but enjoying his enthusiasm.

EDDIE (cont’d)
(flipping the page)
On this one I took ---
Eddie jerked awa towards service door by Jack. Looking back
for one last loo at the smiling girl.

EXT. SERVICE ALLEY
Narrow and crammed. Jack pulling Eddie close.

JACK .
This isn’t a game asshole. Keep it
together or we’re both dead.

Eddie turns and holds out the business card.

EDDIE
Know what that is?

Jack says nothing.

EDDIE (cont’d)
It’s a si n.
(beat?

You know how long I’ve been looking
for a place that sells this
particular buttercream? Well the

irl in there uses the same

uttercream. Gives me their card.
That baker , that girl, this
moment. W at are the odds?

JACK
You are nuts.

EDDIE
I’m just following the signs Jack.
I Rust can’t figure how you fit in
al this.

INT. CAMMERANO’S BAKERY

Alfonse scrubs the icing from his sport coat as Torres and
TWO UNIFORMS enter. They walk over to the Italian Girl who
slides her cake into the display. Torres asking her the
question. The Italian Girl not understanding.

29.

ALFONSE
(eyeing the girl with
contempt)
They go out the back.

EXT. SERVICE ALLEY

Torres stepping out into the narrow delivery way. Looks
right then eft. No Jack or Eddie.

INT. BUILDING STAIRWELL

Jack limps up a back set of stairs as fast as his broken body
can take him. Eddie staying a few steps in front, taking it
slow on purpose.

EDDIE
What's interesting in all this is
cops alwa 5 stick together.
(beatl
So I’m wondering why you're not?

Jack hurrying to the next floor, too winded to say anything.

EXT. SERVICE ALLEY

Torres a block away from the bakery, eyes searching. Rows
of walk—ups. Eyes falling on basement door. All the glans
panels glistening in the morning sun. EXCEPT ONE. Torres
mpves c oser and sees the pane is missing. Unclips his cell
p one...

FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY

Jack’s breathing is heavy as he searches for a hidden key
outside Apartment D. Not there.

JACK
Shit.

Eddie pushes Jack aside.

EDDIE
Step aside and let a pro handle
this.

INT. APARTMENT D

WE HOLD on the door as the SOUNDS of a LOCK BEING PICKED is
heard. Then HEARD again. And AGAIN. The door not 0 ening.
Finally the Medeco dead bolt clicks open, then the cy inder
lock. The door swings open to reveal Jack holding a piece of
the dry cleaning hanger.

30.

JACK
No wonder you’re twelve—time loser.
Can’t pick a simple lock.

EDDIE
Yeah, well if I had more time...

Jack pushes past him as Eddie takes in the surroundings.
Neat, functional and clean.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Woman. About your age. Works.
(touches a half—dead
plant)
A lot. Nothing of any real value.

Jack not listening. Rummaging through the living room
closet. Comes out empty handed.

JACK
Where’d she put it...

EDDIE
Guess you haven’t been here in a
while. You and the lady on the
cuts?

Eddie moving to the hallway now. Spots pictures lining one
of the walls.

PICTURES

Family shots. A SMILING WOMAN in most of them. And two of a
younger, more vibrant Jack. In his rookie uniform with
gleaming, idealistic eyes and a few years later with his arm
around the woman.

EDDIE
So that’s what you look like when
you smile.
(beat)
Your lady’s pretty, Jack.

Eddie eyes drift into the bathroom. Toilet seat up. Man’s
razor on the sink. Uh oh. Eddie quietly lowers t e seat and
hides the razor so Jack doesn’t see. We ks into the bedroom
and slides open the closet. Men’s clothing. Shuts it just
as Jack walks in.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Nothing here. Maybe——

Jack flinging it open. Stares at the clothes, a flash of
hurt and sadness appears on his face then it quickly
disappears.

Leans down into the back of the closet and finally reemerges
with a dust covered -38 and a box of shells. Eddie watches
Jack stare uncomfortably at the clothes for a beat.

31.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Sorry.
HALLWAY

Jack moving full tilt out of the bedroom loading the .38 and
moving towards the door-..

PREEZING when he sees the door handle turn. Motions Eddie
away from the door. Pulling him down the hall just as..
THE FRONT DOOR

EXPLODES inward. Torres stepping inside, WEAPON DRAWN.

INT. APARTMENT D

Torres eyes the living room. Not moving a step. Listening.
Starting his way through the place. Living room, hallway,
bathroom, bedroom, finally the spare room. All empty.

Returns to the living room, holstering his gun.

Almost out the door when Torres spots the empty shell box on
the coffee table.

Torres quickly bolting the door, turning, senses heightened.
Takes out his Glock and moves to the living room closet.

Empty: Now down the hall... Into the bathroom, checking the
shower.

Nothing.

To the bedroom... Windows gated and locked from the inside.

Closet of clothes and nothing else. Back to the hall and
into...

SPARE ROOM

No windows in here. JuSt a desk, wobbly Ikea dresser... and
a lar e closet. Torres levels the gun as he kicks open the
hinge doors...

Not prepared for THE MURPHY BED FALLING FROM THE WALL.
Slamming into Torres and driving him into the ground.
Pinning him underneath, Jack and Eddie on top.

Torres reaching his Glock... fires a round through the
mattress. The shell searing past Eddie’s ear.

Jack rolling off the bed. Torres feeling the cold steel of
Jack’s .38 against his temple. Freezing as Jack COCKS THE
HAMMER.

32.

Eddie lifts the bed as Jack rolls Torres on his belly, using
his handcuffs to secure his hands. Jerks Torres to is feet.
Eddie against the wall, touching his ear. Still feeling the
heat there.

TORRES
Shoulda done what you always do,
Jack.

Jack roughly drops Torres onto the bed. Stops when Torres’
cell phone vibrates.

TORRES (cont'd)
They know I’m here. I don't answer
it...

Jack grabs Torres’ cell phone from his belt and shoves the
bed up into the closet.

FRONT DOOR

Jack racing to the front door, stopping when he sees Eddie’s
got follOWing. Kid standing in the ha 1, strange look on his
ace.

JACK
C’mon.

Not moving. Touching his ear.

JACK (cont’d)
What?

EDDIE
I gotta pee. Should I go now or
ho d it?

JACK
Go already!

Eddie slips into the bathroom_as Jack looks around the

apartment. An endeof—the—road sadness about him as he takes
in what used to be familiar surroundings and is no longer.

JACK (cont'd)
Let's go!

Water still running. Jack bolting to bathroom and kicking
open the door.
BATHROOM

Empty. Window to the fire escape open. Jack looks out the
window and sees Eddie almost to the street.

JACK
Shit!

33.

INT. BUILDING STAIRWELL

Jack huffing and puffing down the stairs. Wincing every time
his left leg hits the marble step. Heart driVing a body that
can no longer keep pace.

Torres’

A pause.

cell phone RINGS. Jack flips it open.

NUGENT (OS)

JACK
He's napping.

NUGENT (03)
Hell Jack. I'm impressed.

You shoot him too?

Jack doesn’t answer.

NUGENT (OS) (cont’d)
Feels good, doesn’t it Jack. Back

JACK
That was a bad thing.

NUGENT (OS)
That’s not the oint Jack.
Shouldn’t have appened. He
couldn’t do what was necessary.
Either can you.

Long silence. Just the SOUND of Jack’s labored breathing.

NUGENT (OS) (cont'd)

You lost him, didn’t you. He
bailed on you.

(laughter)
You blame him?

(beat)
Well I got things to do. Go home
Jack.

(beat)
By the way. I forgot all about
Diane. How’s she been?

Jack slapping the phone shut.

34.

EXT. DELANCEY STREET - MORNING

Service doors to the street BANG OPEN and Jack hits the
sidewalk- No sign of Eddie. MOVING with Jack as he crosses
Delancey, down a cross—town alley and out onto Bowery.

Looking into the SEA OF PEOPLE on their way to work. No way
to spot him in this. Trying to think now...

INT. NUGENT’S CAR - SAME TIME

Nugent shotgun. Mulvey driving. RADIO open as a .
COMMUNICATIONS TECHNICIAN triangulates the cell phone Signal
over the radio from One Police Plaza-

COM TECH (0.3.)
Subject’s moving east on Delancey.
Approaching Bowery.

Mulvey looks at Nugent who smiles.

EDDIE W SAME TIME

Moving QUICKLY down Bowery. Swallowed up by the CROWDS, eyes
straight ahead, notebook under his arm.

But the distant SOUNDS of police SIRENS and the inability to
see past the PEOPLE in front of him puts him on edge.

INT. SUBWAY STATION

Eddie races down the steps and JUMPS IN LINE to buy a token,
EYES TAKING EVERYTHING IN. Behind him a weary WOMAN
COMMUTER, with a defeated, world—won't stop—kicking my—ass
face, grumbles at the line’s slowness.

TWO UNIFORMED COPS coming down the stairs and STOPPING,
RADIOS SQUAWKING.

Eddie wishing the line to MOVE faster, a tuning fork of
Serves. Steps to the window, a TRANSIT COP RIGHT NEXT TO
IM...

EDDIE
One please.

And realizes... he has no money. Looks back at the faces of
impatient COMMUTERS. TRANSIT COP EYES Eddie. Steps out of
line looking for a place to go.

Thinks about jumping a turnstile but ANOTHER TRANSIT COP
hovers just on the other side. PEOPLE pushing past him to
make the next train. SEEING the UNIFORMS begin to scan the
COMMUTERS... The SUBWAY CLOCK announcing it s...

35.

8:31

HEART POUNDING... Then NOTICES the Woman Commuter scooping
30 tokens into her hands and heading for the turnstile. She
FUMBLES and DROPS ALL THIRTY TOKENS on the ground. One rolls
across the cement floor right to Eddie...

Who steps on it.

Looks at the harried Woman as PEOPLE push past her without
even a glance. The Woman gathers up the tokens and starts
for the turnstiles. Eddie not moving a muscle, foot covering
the valuable token. Watching the Woman inch closer to the
gate. Struggling with somet ing and mumbling to himself...

EDDIE (cont’d)
Always do what you've always
done...

Lifts his foot, grabs the token, walks up and hands it to her

EDDIE (cont’d)
Ma'am? You missed this one.

WOMAN
You want a friggin’ reward?

The Woman pushes through the turnstile. Eddie watches her
go, eyes falling to the ground.. and to the glint inside his
right pants cuff... where a single token rests.

SUBWAY PLATFORM

Eddie anxiously makes his way to the front of the platform.
HEARS the BLARE of the approaching D train.

audienly A HAND GRABS HIS SHOULDER and SPINS him around.

Jack pressin his .38 to Eddie’s kidney. Which doesn’t seem
to bother Ed ie.

EDDIE (cont’d)

You gonna shoot me?

(beat)
That bullet back there missed my
head by less than an inch. It was
a sign.

(beat)
And in Case you didn't notice, I
didn’t start being target practice
until I hooked up with you.

36.

JACK
If I can find you Eddie, they can’t
be far behind.

EDDIE
You’re a nice man, Jack. But I
have to follow my signs. And you,
are a big, fat DETOUR sign.
(beat)
You’re the wrong guy, Jack. It’s
not your fault.

The D train SQUEALS into the station. Eddie and Jack JOSTLED
as COMMUTERS surge forward. Jack SHOUTING over the
SCREECHING BREAK .

JACK
Eddie. I can get you there.
(beat)
I need to get you there.

PEOPLE pour out as the doors open. Eddie pushing his way
inside, leaving Jack on the platform.

EDDIE
Don’t worry, Jack. Everything's
going to be okay.

The doors to the car closing. Eddie_puts u_ his hand to wave
good—bye... AND JACK GRABS IT. Pulling Ed is onto the
platform as the doors seal shut.

EDDIE (cont’d)
What the——

Stopping when he sees Jack staring back into the subway car.
Turning to back to see TWO of NUGENT'S GUYS (Touhey an
Kaller) inside the car, FLYING TOWARDS THE CLOSED DOOR.

Jack already pulling Eddie up the stairs as the SOUNDS of
train’s EMERGENCY BREAKS SHRIEKS from the tunnel.

EXT. BOWERY

Jack and Eddie BURST from the subway entrance and into the
street, Jack trying to flag down a cab. Eddie shaken,
nothing making sense.

EDDIE
I don’t get this...

JACK
That’s because you got the I.Q. of
a sprinkler head.

Pulling Eddie down the middle of Bowery looking back at the
SUBWAY EXIT...

37.

EDDIE
Back in the apartment. What did
that u mean when he said you
should do what you always do?

Jack watching for a cab. Knowing they’re seconds away from
being trapped.

EDDIE (cont'd)
You knew him.

JACK
We worked narcotics together back a
ways. They went their way I went
mine.

Eddie processing this. Stops in his tracks as Jack BOLTS
into t e street to flag down a gypsy cab.

Capse they were bad. And you’re

EDDIE
And you know everything, right?

JACK
I know if you drop a slice of bread

jelly side down.

No beating the odds, kid.

Jack feeling the cab slow. Looking ahead at traffic being
diverted onto Grand. Six lanes funneling into three. Jack
checking his watch again the looking out the windows.

CAB DRIVER
Past this we go better.

Jack nodding. Racking his brain. Willing himself to figure
their next move. Slowly approaching Grand, seeing the
REPAIR CREWS in the midd e of Bowery. Jack picks up Torres’
phone and opens it.

JACK
What’s the ADA’s name who cut your
deal?
EDDIE
MacDonald I think.
Starts to dial... and suddenly freezes. Staring at the
phone.
JACK
Stop.

Driver looking confused. Jack tossing money over the seat,
opening the door with the cab still moving and pulling Eddie
out onto

Jack moving to the Grand Street window and peering over the

JACK’S POV

Grand Street traffic jam crawling by..- And a cluster of
Nugent’s PLAINCLOTHES COPS walking the street eyeballing each
car and cab, hands on their weapons.

EDDIE

Jack stepping back, just now noticing the vast array of
clocks a f ashing the same time:

Moving back to the door and stopping, face draining. Two

EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE ROOF

The security access door kicked open by Jack, he and Eddie
starting across the roof.

EDDIE
A few more seconds I woulda had

42.

Moving to the edge and looking down. Five stories below ‘
Nugent’ s COPS grid searching the area. Jack and Eddie mOVing
parallel above them.

Up a four rung ladder and onto the adjoining roof. Jack
struggles to eep pace, his limp more pronounced.

ED DIE (cont’d)
You should get that looked at.

Jack gritting his teeth and walking.

EDDIE (cont'd)
Had a friend who lim ed just like
that. Never had it Iooked at.
Just limped around. Finally got
too much and went to the doctor.
Fracture. Onl now it's infected.
They cut it of . Right above the

Jack glares at Eddie.

Eddie waits the required length for a dramatic pause.

EDDIE (cont’d) ‘
See? You can’t cheat destiny.

The bullet blows through Jack’s right hand before the SHOT is
HEARD.

Jack falling to his knees, catching si ht of MALDONADO on the
far roof in front of them, already on is cell.

Eddie helping Jack to his feet and dragging him back. Over
the facade to the next roof. Stopping as KALLER climbs onto
the roof 60 yards in front of them.

Now moving for rear of their roof, blood seeping out of
Jack's pa m.

EDGE OF ROOF

Eddie looking over. And extremely wide service alley- On
the other si e a giant WAREHOUSE with the words CHINA FARM
painted across its football field sized wall.

One story below the fire escape landing starts. Saturated
with pigeons.

EDDIE
Jump!

Jack hesitates.

EDDIE (cont'd)
C’mon!

JACK
I hate those flying rats.

Kaller’s bullet sprays concrete inches from them. Jack jumps
landing squarely on the steel flooring, pigeons flapping into
the air. Waving his arms like a girl to get them away.
Looking up just as Eddie jumps.

Eddie misjudging the depth and hitting the railing, momentum
and bod weight TAKING HIM OVER IT. Sailin downward until
Jack’s gad hand clas s Eddie's forearm. Ed ie hanging there,
his free hand clutching that notebook.

JACK (cont’d)
Drop the stupid book!

Eddie won’t. Jack's gri lessening. At the last second
Eddie shoves the note 00 in his teeth, grabs the railing and
pulls himself up and over.

44.

Jack on his feet, glaring at Eddie. About to start down when

a second floor window is blasted out. ORTIZ scrambling out

gnto the second floor fire escape, 9mm poised to end it right
ere.

Jack shoving Eddie back against the wall. Looking up at the
roof. The pigeons lining the facade, staring at their perch.
Pinned down and seconds away from being shre ded.

Jack following Eddie's eyes down four stories to a large
dumpster. Too far, too small and too dark inside to know
what’s in there.

JACK (cont’d)
You live it’ll be as a vegetable.

Eddie stuffs his notebook in his pants. Stares closely at
the dumpster.

JACK (cont’d).
Don’t even think about it.

EDDIE
It’s right below us. What are the
odds of that? It’s a sign.

JACK
It’s an ALLEY! That’s where they
put dumpsters!

EDDIE
We can make it.

JACK
There’s no we in this. Just——

EDDIE
I can’t be late, Jack.

And he JUMPS. Sailing four stories, outstretched arms
flapping through space. Thudding hard into the dumpster. A
WHOOSHING SOUND fo lowed by a time delayed eruption of...

Feathers. Thousands of white and red chicken feathers
pluming into the air, Jack staring in disbelief.

JACK _
You gotta be kidding me...

Suddenly the pigeons above set sail. Kaller’s BULLET
RICOCHETING OFF THE RAILING.
INT. DUMPSTER

Eddie pushing away the floating feathers and looking up as
Jack’s body urdles down, slamming onto another sac of
chicken feathers that explode around them.

45.

Jack looking at the fluttering life savers in disbelief. The
first trace of a bewildered smile. Eddie scrambling to the
edge and jumps to the ground as Jack pulls himself out.

EDDIE .
Don’t be so negative next time.

INT. CHINA FARM WAREHOUSE

Security doors blasting open revealing a long corridor. Jack
and Eddie moving quick y down it, blood stil dripping from
Jack’s hand. Stepping through the first door and into...

INT. CHICKEN PEN

A thousand chickens crammed into wire cages stacked one on
top of another to the ceiling. In the middle a steel table
awash in sticky blood attached to a conve or belt. The
SCREECHES bouncing off the sheet metal wa ls is DEAFENING-

Eddie covering his ears, AUSt now noticing the large plastic

EDDIE

INT. BUTCHER'S ROOM

Two dozen LABORERS in bloodied aprons pluck, gut and clean

MEAT AND POULTRY AREA

Restaurant MERCHANTS and CHEFS pick out ducks, chickens and
cuts of beef for today’s menus. Over a HUNDRED PEOPLE jam
the tiny area. Shouting for prize sections like it was the
stock exchange. LOUD and CHAOTIC.

Jack and Eddie appearing through a curtain of plastic
translucent slats into the main area.

Jack realizing he's trapped in the middle of the place and no
idea where they might be coming from. Too many PEOPLE moving
in too many directions. CAMERA craning up above the THRONGS
of PEOPLE and showing us what Jack can t see.

46.

The three teams of Cops surrounding him, moving in perfect
unison right at him.

FISH AND PRODUCE AREA

Kaller and Maldonado coming from the Mott Street exit.
Following Jack’s blood trail. Seconds away.

The SOUND gets to them first. A mixture of high pitched
screeches and human SCREAMS. The Cops stopping in their

Then they see it.

A thousand wild chickens comin right at them. Shrieking, I
pecking, flapping chickens. F uttering four and five feet in
the air... In PEOPLE’S faces, and at their feet. A tidal
wave of white...

A sea of'peopleIrunnin over them. Kaller trying to get his
cell phone to his mout only to be swarmed over y
hysterical, freedom fighting chickens.

EXT. CHINA FARM WAREHOUSE - MOTT STREET

Pandemonium. PEOPLE STREAMING out of the warehouse, chickens
pecking at their legs and arms. The chickens flooding the
sidewa k and darting into the street.

Kaller and Maldonado unable to stem the flow- Not enough
eyes to see it all.

WAREHOUSE WORKERS in long white coats desperately trying to
gather the chickens, getting packed for t eir troubles.

Onéy now noticing two of the white coats ignore the chickens
an just walk off. We lose them in all the confusion...

... just as Nugent’s car pullsIto the curb, Nugent out before
it stops. Eyeing the surroundings Wlth interest. Kaller
stepping to the car.

KALLER
The block's sealed. He can’t get
far.

MOTT STREET

Jack and Eddie emerging from the crowd, dropping their white
coats and slipping into the heart of Chinatown.

Past noodle shops and acupuncture stores. The narrow street
and lack of pedestrians makinint easy to be seen: IJack’s
body out of sync as it pushes itself eyond its limits.

Ortiz’s car screeches into View from behind. TWO MORE cars
appear up ahead. Jack’s pulling Eddie down a flight of
stairs and into...

INT. MADAM SOLKA’S HOUSE OF SPIRITS

Fortunes told and sold in this flamboyant railroad flat.

Jack and Eddie FLYING through beaded curtains, across the
black velvet room lit in deep red and adorned with too many
ornate mirrors. SEVERAL of the SOLKA clan lounge on deep
couches that surround the standard round table with a crystal
ball and tarot cards.

Down a narrow hall, through a tiny kitchen where the little
Solka’s are being fed and into a...

BACK ROOM

Boxes stacked in every corner. A BEEFY GYPSY sits in a
decomposing arm chair uardin the contraband. Already

climb down towards us...

EXT. KLING STREET

Nu ent’s car SCREECHING UP behind Madam Solka's just as
Ka ler and Ortiz exit the rear of the building.

No Jack. Momentary confusion. Sense memory washes through
Nugent.

NUGENT
He’s in the basements. Headed for
the electrical tunnel. He gets in
there we're fucked.

Kaller and Ortiz take off with Torres and Mulvey into Madam
Solka’s as Nugent races his car for the end of the block.

48.

INT. BASEMENT ROOMS

Jack and Eddie move through an under round city. An entire
s are block of basements connected y door—size holes

b asted through cinder block and sheetrock walls. Each one
operating illegal businesses beneath the streets.

Jack pulling Eddie across a CHINESE GAMBLING DEN crowded with
Fan Tan and craps tables towards the door size hole in the
opposite wall.

NEXT BASEMENT

Jack and Eddie emerging from the other side of a wall and

BASEMENT ROOM

MIGRANT WORKERS silk screenin T—shirts and stamping out
knockoff Prada handbags. Jac and Eddie CIOSSlng through,
rolling open a steel door and entering the next room.

This one is empty. An abandoned cock fighting den with open
Wlfi cages and a blood stained ring surrounded by sheetrock
wa s.

EDDIE
How’d you know about this place?

JACK
Years ago we’d try to bust this
place every six months or so.
Never could catch the big shits.
Until we disoovered a feed tunnel
down here.

49.

Jack moving towards an open doorway cut out of the sheetrock.
Suddenly SOUNDS of COMMOTION behind them. Turning to see
Torres and company crossing the room behind them.

Jack racing back. Rolling the steel door over the opening
just as Mu vey gets to it. Mulvey’s gun arm snaking between
it. Barrel aimed at Jack’s face. Index finger trying to
squeeze.

Pressure of the door on Mulvey’s shoulder making it
difficult.

Jack shoving the door one last time. Mulvey SCREAMING and
pulling his arm back.

The door slams shut and Jack bolts it. Turns towards the
next room. Nugent standing in the doorway. Jack pushing
Eddie to the Slde and FIRING.

Nu int and Jack diving to behind opposite sides of the flimsy

Jack landing next to Eddie. BLAM! The 9mm bullet blows a
three inch ole through the wall and zips just under Jack’s
chin. Three more shots blast through t e wall. ECHOING
through the room until it’s silent.

NUGENT (OS)
You alright Jack?

Jack's ears still ringing. Motions for Eddie to stay silent.

NUGENT (OS) (cont’d)
I was aiming for the kid if that
makes you feel better.

EDDIE
You missed.

BLAM! Another slug blisters through the wall just above
Eddie’s head. Jac glaring at Eddie.

NUGENT

On the other side of the wall. Half inch sheetrock the only
thing separating him from Jack and Eddie.

. NUGENT
Kid’s gonna get you killed. He
worth that?

No response. Nugent moving down the wall listening for any
Sign.

NUGENT (cont’d)
Only way out’s in here. Guess we
gotta work something out. I got

50.

BASEMENT ROOMS — JACK AND NUGENT
Jack glances at his watch: 8:51

Looks around the tiny room. He can HEAR The SOUNDS of the
others working on that metal door. Watches as Eddie slips
across the room looking around.

Nugent pops a piece of Juicy Fruit in his mouth then slides
the pac into the open doorway.

NUGENT
Have a piece of gum. We’re gonna
be here a while.

JACK
I'm a sugarless kinda guy.

NUGENT
Then slide ‘em back, will ya?

Even Jack has to grin at that one.

NUGENT (cont'd)
Guess we’re even. You‘ve got my
gum, I’ve got your way out.

Eddie pushing aside a rusted shelving unit to reveal a BROKEN
DOWN SERVICE ELEVATOR, accordion door chained shut. Eddie
turning to Jack wide—eyed. Jack slipping over, whispering...

JACK
Can you get it open?

. EDDIE . I
Got to find something to work with.
It's rusted pretty good.

On the other side of the wall Nugent sits up, sensing
something.

NUGENT (0.5.)
You there Jack?

JACK
(hushed, to Eddie)
Try something.

Jack moving back to the wall.

JACK (cont’d)
Right here Frank.

NUGENT
Thought you left me.

JACK
And not say goodbye?

51.

Nugent removes the throw down gun from his ankle and checks
the cylinder.

NUGENT
What are we doing here Jack? We’re
both too old for this shit.

Jack says nothing. Watches Eddie find a sliver of metal and
begin to fumble with the lock.

NO answer .

NUGENT (cont’d)
Don’t tell me this is all about
that thing.

NUGENT (cont’d)
Cause if it is, I don’t understand.
That was fucking forever ago.
(beat)
Shit like that happens sometimes.

JACK
Shit like that? Like you roughed
up some fucking pimp. He was a
citizen.

NUGENT
Guy shoulda never held out like
that.

Eddie hovers over the rusted lock and chain, ears taking it

all in.

NUGENT (cont’d)

Think I wouldn’t take back what
happened? Do it in a heartbeat.
Far as I know no one's figured how
to do that.

(beat)
I taught you anything I taught you
when you signed up for this job you
put away your heart. Hide it and
don’t take it out until you retire.
You do this 10b you have to get
past things ike that.

JACK I
It crossed the line, Frank. You
crossed the line.

NUGENT
There are no fucking lines. When
are you going to un erstand that?
There’s getting it done or not
getting it done. Period. Ask the
mother of some dead kid if she
wants me to stay in the lines. She
doesn’t care. She wants justice.
That's what I do.

52.

NUGENT (cont'd)
Clear cases and put bad guys away
no matter what it takes. I give
them justice.

Jack looking at Eddie working frantically. Both men stalling
for time...

NUGENT (cont'd)
Course Teddy A never understood
that.

JACK
He was a good cop. Everybody knew”-

NUGENT
He was a stubborn Pollock.

Nugent reloads his 9mm.as he buys himself some time-

NUGENT (cont’d)

He finally busts this big time
dealer he d been chasin’ for years.
Nailed him dead to right. Guy's
got priors as long as my arm so
this animal’s loo ing at forty to

reads the guy his rights. Said he
thought Te dy did it.

(beat)
Like I said, shit hap ens. All my
Teddy had to say was e did it
But e couldn't. By the book or it
didn't count. The scumbag walks.
Think the cocksucker would thank
his lucky stars, pack his shit and
never look back. But that's not
how these beasts think.

(beat)
Fortyasix hours later he hunts down
Tedd and uts four in the back of
his head w ile he sat in his car
eating a sandwich.

A long silence. Mulvey entering Nugent’s room and nodding
silently.

NUGENT (cont’d)
The bad guys have no lines, Jack.
Why shou d we?

JACK
Because we’re supposed to be the
good guys.

NUGENT
I am a good guy. I put my life on
the line every day to put these
scumba s away. Day after day.
Year a ter year. One u dies but
we save six others? I 1 take
that. And so would you.

53.

Eddie wiping sweat off his brow.
Nugent picks up the .32 and stands.

NUGENT (cont’d)

There are three types of people in
this world, Jack. Those who make
it happen, those who watch it
happen, and those who say... what
happened?

(beat)
Guess which one you are.

Jack drops his head as Nugent and Mulve RAISE THEIR

WEAPONS... Eddie still fumbling over t e lock. Making one
last try... Turns the metal sliver once more... POP!
EDDIE
I got it!

BOOM? BOOM? BOOM! The EXPLOSIONS OF GUN FIRE strafe the
room. The flimsy walls shredded from both sides.

Jack crawling through the dust and debris, flopping into the
elevator cage next to Eddie. Kicking the hand e to send the
rickety cage up as bullets ricochet rom all directions.

Nugent and Mulvey step through the shredded sheet rock as
Torres and Ortiz barge in from the other side. Seeing the
service elevator riSing. FIRING futilely at the cast iron
baae disappearing into the ceiling. Mulvey already on his
ra io...

MULVEY
He’s in the building!

INT. WELFARE HOTEL LOBBY

Two ratty arm chairs and graffiti tagged mail boxes. Ortiz

Kaller from the rear. Elevator already open and empty.

FOOTSTEPS echo above them. Ortiz and Maldonado up the back
stairs. Touhey and Kaller up the front.

THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY

Jack and Eddie moving through a maze of chipped linoleum
hallways. VOICES an FOOTSTEPS growing behind them. Turning
down another hall.

Different VOICES LOUDER and CLOSER from in front of them.

Jack stopping. Out of breath and out of options. Starts
rapping on doors. One after another. No one answering. The
SOUNDS closer now. Frantically banging than giving up.
Readying his .38

54.

A door opens a crack. Ancient, frightened eyes staring out.

JACK
(holding up his badge)
Police. Open up!

The door closes. VOICES a split second from turning into the
hallway. The RATTLE of a chain coming off.

INT. SAM’S APARTMENT

Jack and Eddie fall inside. Jack chaining the door. TheIOLD
MAN steps back befuddled. Creeping towards 80, eyes showing
a arm.

SAM
No. You have to go. They said
they'd be back shortly.

VOICES from the hall. Jack puts his finger to his mouth, gun
at his side. Then a KNOCK at the door. And ANOTHER KNOCK.
A long moment. Mumbling of VOICES.-.

EXT. CONFUCIUS PLACE

Frank Nugent stands out front of the Welfare Hotel, Kaller's
VOICE cackling over the radio. Behind him CROWDS begin
lining the block.

KALLER (0.5.)

JACK

Sam gestures to a padlocked door in the hall.

55.

HALL

Jack moving to it, ripping off the Padlock with his gun and
kicking in the door.

INT. BEDROOM

Cell phones. Hundreds of boxes of cell hones stacked on the

queen size bed. The rest of the room fi led bootleg furs,

contraband silks, boxes of electronics and high end linens

Stacked to the ceiling. Jack digs through the mountains of
oxes.

EDDIE
Someone’s using this guy’s place to
store their shit.

JACK
Ghost Shadows or Tongs probabl .
Those gangs use shut—ins like him
to warehouse their stash, drugs.
People like him have nobody and are
just too scared to say anything.

Jack moving back into the...

LIVING ROOM

Sam wishing them to leave. Nervously standing there, oddly
resplendent in his tweed sports coat, crisp w ite shirt and
burgundy colored ascot. Pants neatly creased, shoes shined.
Holding tightly to what little dignity he is afforded.

JACK
Your phone.

The old man pointing to the kitchenette and a cordless phone
with oversized buttons. Jack stuffing some paper towels in

his palm and grabbing the phone. Putting his .38 on a table
near the front door.

Eddie taking in the room. A single fold out bed, a chenille
bedspread lovingly draped across it. Tin tray table with a
transistor radio or a night stand holding a picture frame
and brush. Steamer trunk serving as a dresser. 15 inch
Pillips on the floor showing QVC. All shoved into one
corner. A little oasis shoved into one corner.

Sam looks pleadingly to Jack as he walks by.

SAM
I never open the door. They told
me not to. You have to leave.
They’re going to come back soon.
Please.

56.

Sam sitting down on his bed, worried eyes constantly moving
to the door. Eddie sitting next to him.

EDDIE
We’ll be one in a minute.
(beat?
I’m Eddie.

SAM
Sam.

I EDDIE I
Hi Sam. Lemme ask you something.
You’re driVing in a hurricane...

Jack moves toward the back, dialing the phone.

JACK
(into phone)
Dan MacDonald’s office.

Waits as he’s transferred. Looks back at Eddie and the old
man.

EDDIE
So who would you take?

Sam’s eyes sparkle to life. He reaches over and turns a
picture frame in Eddie’s direction. A creased snapshot of a
young WOMAN standing in front of a massive, ornate CLOCK.

Eddie stares at the photo then to Sam.

EDDIE (cont’d)
The girl of your dreams. You take
her?

Now peering through a dirty window. Uniformed POLICE wander
the lock, blue barricades lining the curb. Jack not
understanding. A VOICE on the other end of the phone.

JACK
(into phone)
Dan MacDonald please.
(beat)
Tell him it’s the guy with his
witness.

INT. HALLWAY - 100 CENTRE STREET — MORNING

A OVERWORKED CLERK races for all he’s worth down a brightly
lit corridor, sliding around one corner and flying through a

door with a large C over it.

57.

INT. GRAND JURY ROOM C

Small and plain with no windows. TWENTY FOUR CITIZENS sit at
one end in a semi—circle of tiered seats. In front of them
are a COURT STENOGRAPHER, two COURT OFFICERS and a desk I
occu ied by Assistant District Attorney DAN MACDONALD and his
meas y STAFF of TWO. An easel holding a diagram, case
numbers and names is prominent.

The air is tense and uncomfortable as the Overworked Clerk
slips behind MacDonald and whispers in his ear.

INT. ADA MACDONALD’S OFFICE

The mid—morning SUN illuminates mountains of files stacked in
every conceiva le space. MacDonald, 30, runs his hand across
where his hair used to be. (INTERCUT as needed)

MACDONALD
I just hung up with your Ca tain
ten minutes ago. You shou d’ve
been here by now. Where the hell
are you?

JACK
About seven blocks away. Only
there’s a few Cops between me and
you that don’t want him there.
You’re going to have to buy
yoursel some more time.

MACDONALD
There is no more time. The jury’s
tenure ends at ten. That’s it.
Without that kid they’ll vote “No
Bill” and Ryan walks and case goes
in the toilet.

JACK . I
You guys could indict a ham
sandwich. What’s the deal?

MacDonald slumps onto his desk, swivels to face a bulletin
board with pictures of Police Officers, witnesses and case
numbers. Red magic marker lines connect the faces to one
another. Weariness drips from voice.

MACDONALD

Went fishing without enough bait.
My boss thought if we went to the

rand jury R an would fold. He

idn't. We ad only circumstantial
until we ran into Edward Bunker
last night. He’s an eye witness.
He makes it all work.

I got one shot at this, Mosley. I

need that kid.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

Jack watching as an army of CHINESE FAMILIES in brightly

Confucius Place. MUSICIANS gather in the street.

And suddenly understanding what it is.

MACDONALD (OS)

Jack doesn’t answer. Thinking.

JACK
Someone over there set this thing
in motion. You got a leak.

Maybe even one of your squad.

See you at the courthouse.

CLICK. Jack moves away from window. Pulls Eddie towards the

BAM! Sam’s DOOR blows open, TWO ON LONG GANG MEMBERS step
inside. Cool, menacing stares. The larger one, ONG, steps
in as his PARTNER hangs back. Heavy boots, overcoats like
tents.

ONG
What the fuck is this?

Ong glaring at Sam, not movin from the door. His Partner
Eoyes to t e bedroom. YELLIN something in Chinese from the

You steal my things? THIS IS MY
PLACE!

Jack puts his hands up in surrender. Eyes his gun sitting
behind Ong on the tab e.

ONG (cont’d)
Who are you?

JACK
We needed a phone. No trouble. We
just want to walk out of here.

The Partner reappears and mumbles something in Chinese.
Tense Silence as Ong stares down Jack. Then he grins and

s it: at Jack. No response from Jack. Ong motions them to
t e oor.

JACK (cont’d)
Eddie.

Eddie points to Sam.

59.

EDDIE
What about him?

JACK
What about him? He’s fine.
(to Sam)
You fine?

Sam nervously nods.

JACK (cont’d)
He’s fine. Let’s go.

Eddie doesn’t budge.

EDDIE
He opened the door.
JACK
Eddie.
EDDIE

He never opens the door. That’s
what he said. But today he did.
When we needed him to. It’s a
sign.

(beat)
We’re supposed to help him. He
can’t stay here.

JACK
Don’t start with this -—

But Eddie already has, turning to Ong.

EDDIE
Think you’re tough shit pickin’ on
a litt e old man. Well I’m
standing right here and I don’t see
you doing something about that. So
you must be a pussy.

Jack’s shoulders slump. Ong whips out a six inch blade and
moves for Eddie. WHAMI Ong’s arm snaps like a twig, Jack’s
move so quick and so jarring, the pain hasn’t even registered
yet. The thumb to the windpipe does, sending Ong to the
ground gasping for air.

Jack already to the .38 , spinning and SPLITTING OPEN the
Partner’s nose before his weapon clears his belt. The two
writhing on the floor in mass1ve pain.

Jack clutching his hand, nauseous from the pain, kneels down
and confiscates ID’s from both.

JACK
Get your shit out of here and don’t
come back.

(MORE)

60.

JACK (cont'd)
Anything happens to that man, he
gets so muc as a cold, and I will
tell Tommy Chan the two of you are
my stoolies.

Frightened look from Ong as Jack shows his badge.

JACK (cont’d)
You know what Tommy Chan did to the
last rat he can ht? Cut the
bastards head 0 f and mailed it to
his mother.

Eddie leans in.

EDDIE
And two hundred dollars a month.
Under the door. Cash.
(off Jack’s look)
They shoved him in a corner like he
was an animal. Used his place.
They should pay him rent for that.

Jack looks at Eddie differently this time. The slightest
trace of a smile. Turns to the broken men.

JACK
What he said.

INT. SECOND FLOOR STAIRWELL

Jack and Eddie descending, eyes and ears open. Jack’s limp
more pronounced.

EDDIE
You were going to walk out and
leave him there.

JACK
Can’t fix everything, Eddie.
EDDIE |
You sound like your friend down
there.
That one stings.
JACK

He ain’t m friend. And I’m
nothing li e him.

EDDIE
But you know what he did. What
this is about, don’t you?

It takes a while for Jack to answer.

61.

JACK

Witness tampering. You saw two
police detectives intimidating a
witness for profit.

(beat)
They been doing it for years.
Started out as a way to keep their
informants on the street. They get
popped, Frank would find the key
witness and get him to chan e t eir
tune. Threaten him or his amily.
Keeps his snitch out there workin .
Least that’s how they rationalize
it. Until they figured out they
could squeeze some money out it.

EXT. CONFUCIUS PLACE - MORNING

Riotous with every imaginable color. SOUNDS of FIRECRACKERS,
loud GONGS and DRUMS accompany CHANTS of long life and
happiness.. The Wedding procession moving towards Mott
Street and past police arricades.

Torres and Kaller on either side, Ortiz and Maldonado watch
the back. Touhey on the roof.

In front Nugent and Mulvey move amongst the revelers,
slipping amongst them like barracudas.

INT. RESIDENCE LOBBY

Jack and Eddie moving across the deserted lobby and settling
on either side of the front doors. The MUFFLED SOUNDS of the
procession growing LOUDER. Jack staring out into the chaos.

Nervous time.

EDDIE .
You know they’re out there waiting.
What are we going to do?

JACK .
Wait for one of your Signs.

Quiet as they watch the swirl of people gathering along the
street.

EDDIE
What were you talking about with
him in the basement. Something
about a citizen.

Jack’s eyes grow hard. They never leave the street as he
speaks.

JACK
Four years ago one of Nugent’s top
informants stabbed a cab driver.

(MORE)

62.

JACK (cont‘d)
Nugent needed this guy so he pays a
visit to the eye witness. Up to
this oint the witnesses were
nicke and dime scum bags. This
one was different. Chinese guy.
Sixty something. A citizen minding
his own business.
(beat)
The old guy wouldn’t budge. Sticks
to his story. Frank threatens him
but the guy doesn’t fold. Gets so
mad he shoves his un in the guy’s
mouth. Guy drops ead right there.
Heart attack. Frank leaves.
gamily finds the old guy the next
ay.

Long silence as the wedding Parade comes into View. Behind
them the elevator opens and a LARGE FAMILY of NINE emerges
and heads for the front doors.

EXT. CONFUCIUS PLACE

The bridal chair passing. Held high above the crowd.

Heavily curtained to prevent the bride from glimpsi g unlucky
sights. Mirrors of a l shapes and sizes decorate it s red
satin sheath, protecting her from evil influence. FAMILY
scatters grain and beans as symbols of fertility. ATTENDANTS
with lanterns and banners swirl among them. A papier—mache
Unicorn dances around her for luck. MUSICIANS play a Chinese

wedding SONG.

The Hotel doors open, the LARGE FAMILY oozes outside.

Nugent and Mulvey seeing it right away. Pushing through the
CR WDED SIDEWALK towards the Family. Getting to them just as
they are swallowed up by the crowd.

Pulling them apart but Jack and Eddie are not there. Nugent
and Mu vey whipping around, eyes searching the sidewalk...

ON JACK

Out the SERVICE DOORS and into the middle of the street.
Surrounded by swirling color and movement. A dozen parasols
spinning along side Jack. Behind him a twenty foot DRAGON
snakes in and out of the CROWD. The firecrackers being set
off to frighten away evil spirits all around him.

Eddie six yards ahead of him.

EXT. CONFUCIUS PLACE

The spectacle flowing past the barricades and outside the
estab ished perimeter. The Groom, accompanied by a child as
an omen of his future sons, waits for his bride.

63.

JACK

Safety just fifteen yards away. Willing himself to keep
going. Ten yards...

REVELERS CHANT. Behind Jack the Dragon slithers away
revealing'Mnlvey, ste ping up from behind, Glock coming up.
The dragon snakes bac in between them...

Mulvey trying to push it out of the way, finally ducking
underneat it only to find... Jack gone.

Pushing through the CROWD as the CAMERA drifts up high over
ConfuCius Place, the THRONGS of PEOPLE spilling away in all
directions...

INT. VIDEO ARCADE — MORNING

Noisy and crammed with ASIAN YOUTHS. One PUNK banging on the
rest room door, throwing up his hands.

JACK’S WATCH
Sitting on the edge of a sink. 9:12

INT. VIDEO ARCADE REST ROOM
Two stalls, a urinal and a rusty sink where Jack runs water

over his hand. Eddie standing on the toilet tank peering
through a mesh grating that looks onto the street.

EDDIE'S POV

West Broadway and in particular a shoe shine stand across the
street that is presently unoccupied.

ARCADE REST ROOM
Eddie jumping down.

EDDIE
Six blocks.

JACK I I
Might as well be SlX miles we don’t
get some help.

EDDIE
They say there are no shortcuts to
places worth going.

Jack stuffing paper towels in his palm. Laughs.

64.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Someone’s going to help us, Jack.
Don’t you worry.

JACK
I shot a cop and you’re a rat.
Who’s geing to he p us.

Eddie smiles a weary smile and lets it go.

EDDIE
We’ll make it. And before ten.
Cause I have to be —

JACK
-— someplace before noon. Where do
you have to be that’s so important?

EDDIE
A place. Got to pick up something.

Cynical laugh from Jack.

EDDIE (cont’d)
It’s not what you think. I’m a
baker Jack.

JACK
Thief to cake maker. Just like
that.

Bleeding stopped. Eddie up on the toilet checking again.
Nothing.

EDDIE

Not just like that. It was a
process. A journey. Because I
followed the signs.

(jumps back down)
Like nine months ago I’m
incarcerated. The throw this
ancient guy in wit me. Marvis.
Has cancer in his throat, so he can
hardly talk. But that first night
he says something that started it
all. Says, “If you always do what
you always done, you’ll always have
what you always got".

( eat

)
Well I don’t like what I got.
Thievin' ives me upset stomachs
and I sucg at it. Maybe I should
try something else.

JACK
Ifm sure check washing crossed your
mind.

EDDIE

Nope. Cakes. On the inside I’m
known for my cakes.

EDDIE (cont'd)
But as a goof, I start decorating

Girlfriends. Cars. Gang logos.
You name it. Find out I m great at

it.

(beat)
I got nothin’ but time so I do my
due diligence and find you can make
good money on birthday cakes. Kid

on one and whoos , your mark—up is
through the roof.

Jack just staring at this kid. Nods for Eddie to check

again,
Empty.

so he climbs back up and checks the shoe shine stand.

EDDIE (cont’d)

Nothing.

(beat)
Anyway I get out and start saving
for my own place. I’m doin’ okay
but I don’t see a bakery in my
future any time soon. Which I
figure wi 1 cost thirty grand to
get started. But I kee tellin’
myself do what ou’ve a ways done,
have what you a ways got.

(Shrugs)
I didn’t give up like I always did.
I had faith for some reason. Then
one amazing episode after another
and I have the money.

(beat)
Why was that old guy was put in
with me? It was a sign. And this
time I didn’t miss it. We'll be
okay. Because I was meant to bake
cakes.

Eddie climbing to look again.

JACK
Hate to burst your bubble kid, but
in 23 years of police work I’ve
never met a thief that stayed out.

EDDIE
People change Jack.

JACK
Dates change. Seasons change.
People don t.

Eddie shakes his head then spots something across the street.

EDDIE
Tall, skinny guy?

66.

EXT. SHOE SHINE STAND — MORNING

SHAQUILLE EVANS sits on his high shoe shine chair, legs
stretched. Munching on a Cinnabon, licking his fingers and
watchin gaggles of KOREAN GIRLS waddle by. A sign behind
him.rea s: SHINIST OF FINE FOOTWEAR

Six—nine, 165 pounds, he looks like a praying mantis in shiny
lime green sweats. A burn scar puckers his eft cheek,
drawing the eye into a permanent squint. An old thirty.

A SANITATION WORKER moseys up and holds out a twenty.

SANITATION WORKER
They said you got phone cards.

SHAQUILLE
I got phone cards, green cards,
credit cards, ID cards. I’m the
card king, garbage man.

Shaquille reaching into his shine box and taking out a pile
of pre—paid phone cards wrapped in a rubber band.

Shaquille (cont’d)
How many minutes you want?

The Worker takes a sixty minute card for his twenty and walks
away revealing Jack and Eddie standing there.

INT. SHAQUILLE'S APARTMENT

The door opens and Shaquille leads Jack and Eddie inside.
02: and Harriet neat and clean with matching furniture and
wal to wall.

SHAQUILLE
Honey! Look who’s here?
(beat)
I’ll get my keys.

Shaquille heads down the hall as his wife, SALMA appears in
the kitchen doorway. Pretty Puerto Rican woman in er late
20's. Her glare saying it all. She hates Jack.

JACK
(uncomfortable)
Salma.

She turns back into the kitchen without a word.

EDDIE
A guy saves your life you owe him.
Therefore ou take your best friend
from that bus stop.

67.

JACK
And leave the women. I don’t think
that makes you a good soul. Do
you?

EDDIE
(slumping)
No.

Silence... Suddenly Eddie brightens.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Chuck Berry.
(off Jack’s look)
Was an armed robber. Went to
prison.

Jack looks completely confused.

EDDIE (cont’d)

INT. TOWN CAR

Shaquille easing into the stop and go as traffic congests.
Clutches the steering wheel with NERVOUSNESS. Eyes peeled

Jack and Eddie back to back. Eddie humming.

JACK
What’s that you keep humming?

EDDIE
Sorry I’ll stop.

JACK I

Eddie does it almost inaudibly. Jack following it in his
head. Car moving again.

JACK (cont’d)
Wheels on the bus?
(half singing)
The wheels on the bus goes round
and round, all through the town.

Eddie starts singing it.

EDDIE
The people on the bus go up and
down, up and down...

IJACK
I though it was the horn went toot—
toot—toot.

70.

EDDIE
That comes after. Wheels, people,
horn then money in the box.
There’s more but I can’t remember
‘em.

JACK I
Whatever. Why that stupid song?

EDDIE
I don’t know. My sister sung it to
me when I was little. Said if I
sang it to myself the scary stuff
wou d go away.

JACK
How old are you?

EDDIE
Twenty—four.

JACK
Twenty—four and you believe singing
an idiotic song ike Wheels-On—The—
Bus will make you brave.

Eddie doesn't respond.

JACK (cont'd)
You know it’s stupid, right?

EDDIE
I guess.

JACK
You guess?

EDDIE
Okay it’s stupid. I won’t do it
anymore.

JACK
Do it, don’t do it. I don’t care.
I’m just saying it’s stupid.

EDDIE
I heard you the first time.

Eddie moves away from Jack. Jack suddenly aware he’s hurt
Eddie’s feelings.

JACK
Look—-

EDDIE
I’m not doing it anymore, okay?
Just drop it.

Car hits a pot hole causing both to wince. Jack feeling
badly. After some silence...

71.

JACK
The wipers on the bus go swish—
swish—swish, then the doors go 0 an
and shut then the driver on the us
says move on back. That’s the
rest.

TheIfaintest smile appears on Eddie’s face. The car turning
again. Ride bumpy a of a sudden. A quick flash of the
brake light revea s a strange look on Jack’s face.

INT. TOWN CAR

Shaquille nervously steering the car down a service alley,
sweating profusely in spite of the AC on high.

Suddenly Jack’s .38 is at his temple.

JACK
Where you going Shag?

Rear seat pushed out, Jack COCKING THE HAMMER back.

SHAQUILLE
(stammering)
Frank pulled me just before you
showed. Said if you reached out I
gotta call him. Threatened my kid!
Swear to Christ I didn’t want to——

Suddenly through the windshield NUgent, Torres and MUlvey
grow larger as the car heads towards them.

Jack’s over the seat, JAMMING HIS FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR and
PUSHING SHAQUILLE OUT THE DOOR. The Lincoln jerking forward
and barreling down on Nugent.

Nugent, Torres and Mulvey FIRING THEIR WEAPONS into the car.
Windshield SHATTERS as Jack dives into the back...

Jack getting off THREE SHOTS before taking off.

72.

JACK AND EDDIE

Racing into the middle of Lafayette Street. MTA bus chugging
through traffic just ahead. Nugent’s COPS flying onto t e
sidewalks.

Jack breathing through his mouth, two heartbeats away from a
heart attack. Knee buckling but keeps going. Closing on the

at the driver.

Jack losing steam as the doors swing open. Eddie jumping on

grabbing Jack’s wrist.

trying to keep him up. A SUIT, TIE and BRIEFCASE turns to
Jack.

STAB
This guy can’t stand any more.

Jack thinks, then grabs several newspapers from off the

Hostage Negotiator MIKE SHEEHAN walks up clipping a headset
to his ear.

SHEEHAN
What do we got?

WAGNER
Cop. Vet. Flipped, shot a

Sheehan eyes the group. Decides not to say anything-

SHEEHAN
How many in there?

WAGNER
We’re blind right now. We’re
checking the route.

Sheehan stares at the bus. Papers finished going up.

SHEEHAN
Suicidal?

WAGNER

Sheehan eyes Nugent.

JACK’S POV

Nothing but guns trained on the bus. 360 degrees of
automatic wea ons scatter the landscape. Rooftops, store
fronts, vehic es. Even the SOUNDS of HELICOPTERS can be
heard above.

Watches Wagner and Gruber talking with Sheehan. Then sees
Nugent staring at the bus. Looking RIGHT at the window
Jack’s peering out of. Like he can see him...

INT. BUS

Jack moves away. Every terrified face on the bus on him.
Looks at his watch.

9:25

Jack sits. You can see all hope and desire ebb from his
broken body. Eyes dim. Shoulders slump. Eddie sits next to
him and puts his hand on Jack’s shoulder.

IEDDIE _
They say in every adverSity there’s
seeds for a greater opportunity.

Jack doesn’t respond. Just stares at the floor. Whatever
fight that was left is long gone.

78.

Eddie gets up and walks to the back window and peers out._
Jack notices Eddie’s notebook on the seat beside him. Flips
it open...

THE NOTEBOOK

Beginning pages crammed with cake designs, recipes and

in redients. Deeper in, the pages are filled With

ca culations of costs, equipment prices and lists of various
distributors. Business cards, lease agreement from a Seattle
building owner taped to some pages. A question mark next
to Jack s name- Months of painstaking thought. Each page
filled with hope, craft and hard work.

INT. BUS

Jack looking up at Eddie. Differently this time. The kid
consoling a LATINO WOMAN, that ever present smile soothing
her.

Jack’s eyes drifting to the radio on the seat across from
him. Picks it up.

Looks like it.

Nugent pulls him away from the others.

NUGENT I
I need you to do something.

INT. BUS

Jack gathering the passengers into the center aisle. Sizing
up the GUY IN THE SUIT. Looking at his grey suit. Two
buttons and pants with cuffs. Points to him...

JACK

You. .
(nods over to Eddie)
Change clothes with him.

EDDIE
Me? What for?

80.

JACK
You wanted a suit didn’t you?

Eddie sensing something’s not right.

EDDIE
What are you doing?

JACK
You’re leaving with them.

Eddie’s stunned.

EDDIE
Why? They’re coming here, right?
Eou told them to bring everybody
ere.

JACK
No one’s coming, Eddie. I ‘ust
said that so t ey wouldn't e ready
when this goes down.

Eddie’s confused.

EDDIE
What about testifying?

JACK
Forget about testifying.
(beat)
In less than 10 minutes they’re
going to breach the bus. Stun
grenades, tear gas and AK—47’s.
Five seconds from bang to bullets.
They’ll kill me and you then go
have a sandwich. Stay in here and
ou’ll die. The onl chance you
ave is to get OFF t is bus.
(beat)
It’s over.

Eddie stares into Jack’s spiritless eyes. Just now starting
to understand.

EDDIE
What about making that guy pay?
(beat)
Don’t quit now, Jack. We’re a
team. Maybe we're not seeing a
Sign we’re supposed to see.
Maybe...

But Jack’s already made up his mind, leading the line to the
front of the bus.

81.

EXT. BUS/INTERSECTION

SWAT and HRT take up positions around the bus. RADIOS
cackle as everyone readies for an all out assault.

When the Bus doors open. Hands up, one after another,
passengers step down onto the street.

Confusion. RADIOS all blare with “Hold your Fire!” Commands.

INT. RAY’S PIZZERIA

EXT. BUS/INTERSECTION

Helmeted SWAT TEAMS dart into the intersection grabbing
passengers and pulling them away from the bus while
sharps ooters remain focused on the door.

INT. BUS

Jack stands near the front doors out of street view. Eddie
in the middle of the line dressed in the grey suit. He can’t
help looking down at it. Exactly what he wanted.

JACK
(to passengers)
Remember keep your hands above your
heads until they tell you to put
‘em down.

Eddie moving next to Jack.

. EDDIE
This isn’t the way it was supposed
to be.

Jack ignoring him. Tapping each passenger to signal they can
step out. Eddie sounding more li e a child now, fear in his
veice.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Listen to me. I don't want to
leave like this. I-——

82.

Jack pulls Eddie into line, adjusts his tie.

JACK
When you get out there, they’ll
haul you to a debriefing area.
It’s going to be hectic in there...

EDDIE
Jack. I need to tell you how much"—

JACK
Try and get out of there fast. Get
as: the perimeter and don’t look

Jack pushes him out the door.

EXT. BUS/INTERSECT ION

Eddie stepping onto the street, hands shielding his eyes as
two SWAT OFFICERS swoop down, grab him by the arms and whisk
him away from the bus.

INT. BUS

Jack peering through a slit in the newspaper as Eddie is led
through the crowd. FOUR more PASSENGERS remain...

INT. FLOWER SHOP

Crammed and LOUD. Hastily set up area where HRT DETECTIVES
interview the released passengers. Eddie’s dropped into the
hands of a PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER.

PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER
You hurt?

Eddie shakes his head, eyeing the confusion and chaos in
ere.

PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER (cont’d)
We’re gonna take a statement and
ask you some questions.

Eddie being led to the rear of the flower store. Spots Torres
and Mulvey huddling near the front door.

EDDIE
There a bathroom here?

EXT. SIDE ALLEY

Eddie exits the shop through the service door and walks
through a swarm of UNIFORMED POLICE milling about. Onto the
sidewalk, turns left and is swallowed up by the CROWD.

83.

ON EDDIE

As he ducks under the yellow police tape as MORE SWAT race
past him.

He’s free.

But for some reason Eddie stops. Eyes the GIANT CLOCK above
the BANK:

9:29

Then taking in SWAT TEAMS getting ready to breach. Looking
to the solitary bus, the LAST TWO PASSENGERS stepping out to
safety and the doors hissing shut.

INT. BUS - SAME TIME

Jack stands alone amongst the fluttering newspapers. Sealed
inside and resigned to his fate.

EXT. BUS/INTERSECTION

SWAT MOVING like a well—oiled machine. Positions taken by

to STAND DOWN or GET HIM OUT OF THERE.

CHAOS Slowiy ERUPTS

The STAB being escorted to the Flower Shop trying to tell
anyone whoni I listen that that’s his suit! But ALL EYES

NUGENT recognizing Eddie and racing to the line to get a
SHOT.

Eddie walking towards the bus, hands still in the air,
IGNORING THE PANDEMONIUM around him.

EDDIE (cont’d) .
Don’t shoot! I forget something in

84.

Ten yards awa ... Nugent PUSHING through the THRONGS, gun
out of his ho ster._ Taking ADV.... Then JOSTLED by SWAT who
SWARM the intersection and try to get Eddie’s attention.

INT. BUS - SAME TIME

Jack HEARING the COMMOTION and peering out to see whatfs
happening. All he can see are CONFUSED SWAT TEAMS mov1ng
into the intersection and SCREAMING at someone...

Then BANGING on the bus DOORS. Jack looking over and seeing
a NOTEBOOK slide between the rubber sealers.

The DOORS are PRIED OPEN and Eddie steps up into the bus.

EDDIE
Almost forgot. You never told me
what you wanted on your cake.

JACK
Are you out of your mind!

EDDIE
Well I wanted to send you
something. You know, to thank you
for all you did for me.

Jack is almost speechless.

JACK
You got away, you dumb shit!

EDDIE

I never get away, Jack. You saw my
sheet. At least doing what I
always did.

(beat)
I just want to do what I said I’d
do. So I don’t end up like I
always have.

Jack staring at the kid. Eddie staring right back. About to
say more...

BOOM! BOOM? BOOM! Windows imploding as gas canisters and
stun grenades pierce the bus.

Both hitting the floor. Jack crawling to the drivers seat,
starting the bus and hitting the acce erator.

EXT. BUS/INTERSECTION

The bus rolis forward. Rumbling straight through the
barricades in front of it. SWAT TEAMS fire from every
angle, BULLETS STRAFING THE ENTIRE BUS.

Bus picking up speed. Sparks and smoke coming from the wheel
drums. The SOUND of metal grinding on cement is unearthly.

85.

Confusion from all Units as the bus begins to outrun them.
Heading directly for Canal.

EXT. CANAL STREET

Massive cement barricades already set in lace. Behind them
an army of FIRE and EMS trucks. Behind t em, a DOZEN
SHARPSHOOTERS, assault rifles aimed and ready. This bus is
going no further than here.

INT. BUS

Eddie holding on as the bus lists from side toIside. Jack
tearing off a piece of a newspaper to see. Gaining speed as
Canal approaches. Both seeing the barricades for the first
time.

JACK
Any words of wisdom now, smart guy?

EDDIE
Look for the signs.

Bullets spray the inside of the bus. Ricochetting
everywhere. Jack looking through the shattered windows and
smoke for something. Anything. Eyes catching a metal sign
on the side of a building stating: ALL DELIVERIES THIS WAY.
And arrow pointing down a service alley.

JACK
Hold on.

Eddie STARTS SINGING WheeISeOn-The- Bus LOUDLY and falls into
a seat as Jack swings the wheel hard left.
EXT. LAFAYETTE STREET

The right side of the bus lifting off the ground as it makes
the turn at full speed. Straightens, landing hard, sparks
shooting from all four rims.

Screaming towards the mouth of an alley as SWAT TEAMS
scramble to keep up.
INT. BUS - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The alley opening approaching fast... and looking wa too
small. Eddie humming louder now. Turning away a sp it
second before...

86.

EXT. LAFAYETTE STREET/ALLEY WAY

the bus slams into the opening. Sides grindingIagainst
the brick walls, peeling open like a can opener. Mirrors,
reflectors and door han les splintering.

Then stops. The bus wedged a third of the way in. Smoke
billowing from.underneath, the smell of burning metal
intense.

ALLEY WAY

In milliseconds the bus is surrounded. From rooftops SWAT
and HRT descend onto the bus’ roof. In the front an EMS
truck slams into the crumpled grill. From the rear an army
of Tactics already leveling their weapons awaiting word.

The bus sitting there hissing. The sound of rustling
newspaper flapping in blown out windows.

Sheehan racing up, RADIO cackling.

WAGNER (OS)
Breach it!

MORE stun grenades and tear gas are blasted through the shot
out windows.

INT. BUS

SWAT TEAMS in masks crash through the back and side windows.
A thick smoke hides everything except for the pin point
lasers from SWAT rifles as they sweep the interior.

gay Fitzpatrick taking the point and moving towards the

Smoke clearing as they get to the front... Ray ready to put
down agything that moves... Then finds the buses doors open
and we ged a most parallel to an alley delivery door. Which
hangs open.

EXT. CENTRE STREET

BUSINESSES and SHOPS emptying as PEDESTRIANS head north
towards Canal to see the commotion. Eyes on the AVIATION
UNITS circling the block.

Jack and Eddie moving against the flow. The Courthouse right
there three blocks straight ahead and nothing in their way.
Eddie clutching his coat tight. Jack still reeling.

Thinking if Eddie didn’t come back... If he was on that bus
a one...

87.

Eddie’s eyes seem different. Unfocused. His steps sluggish.
His notebook slips from his coat as they cross the
intersection at Franklin.

Jack looking back and spotting Eddie’s notebook fluttering in
the middle of Franklin. Looking up at the courthouse. Two
blocks to go. Willing himself to ignore the book and keep
going. Starting to walk faster...

JACK
Shit...

Jack turns and jogs the half a block for the book. Holding
up traffic as he picks it up and starts back towards Eddie.

Holding up for Eddie to see. Then watching Eddie fall to the
pavEmeng for no apparent reason. RaCing up and pulling him
to is eet.

JACK (cont’d)
You okay?

EDDIE
I think I got shot.

Jack now seeing the blood seeping from Eddie’s neck.
Grabbing him around the waist, pulling to his feet and
towards the courthouse as Eddie hums.

JACK
Two more blocks.
Eddie nods again. Takes a few more steps... and stops
humming.

INT. TIRE WAREHOUSE

A massive, warehouse filled with used tires waiting to be
melted down. Eddie lays alone in darkness. Jack’s shirt
covers the wound but is now soaked in blood...

The massive warehouse door is rolled open and Jack quickly
moves to Eddie’s side. Presses on the shirt harder.

JACK
I got help on the way. Just hang
in there. We’re almost home.

Eddie barely nods. Eyes closing.

JACK (cont’d)
C'mon. You gotta stay awake. Talk
to me. Bus stop. Three people.
Who you gonna save?

Eddie stares into nothingness. Eyes searchin for something.
Suddenly there’s a hint of sparkle in them an Eddie smiles.

88.

EDDIE
I know the answer, Jack.

JACK
The friend. Loyalty.

Eddie shakes his head. Finding peace within himself he looks
up at Jack.

EDDIE
Port Authority.

Jack looks at Eddie, not understanding.

EDDIE (cont’d)

Locker there with thirty—two
thousand dollars in it.

(beat)
Except they sweep the lockers out
every 24 hours.

(beat)
That’s why I have to get there by
noon.

Jack pulls the shirt away and sees the wound for the first
time. An uneasy feeling fills him.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Couple days ago this guy Maurice
turns up at my place with a gun and
a shoebox he took it from a dealer
on Ocean Avenue. Needs a place to
lay low. I tell him I’m on
parole... but he’s not asking.

Jack working more feverishly as Eddie’s words flow out
dreamlike.

EDDIE (cont’d)

Then somebody deceased Maurice that
next morning.

(beat)
Inside that shoebox was thirty—two
thousand, Jack. Exact amount to
open my bakery. It was a sign,
wasn’t it?

JACK
A big, bold one.

Jack ressing the shirt against Eddie’s neck trying to slow
the b ood flow.

EDDIE
Stashed it in a locker at Port
Authority yesterday. But when I
come bac to my room my P.O.'s
standing there with Maurice’s gun
on my bed.

89.

EDDIE (cont'd)

I’m looking at fifteen years for
having a weapon that’s not mine.
Until that DA happens to stop by my
cell with the picture of that cop.

(beat)
Which is how I met you.

(beat)
See how it all makes sense?

Jack nods. Then Eddie goes silent.

JACK .
Hey. You’re not going to die on me
are you?

The words are hoarse.

EDDIE
I don’t know. I never died before.

Drifting off.

JACK
Eddie.

An effort to open his eyes.

JACK (cont'd)
You were meant to have that bakery.

Eddie’s mouth cracks the tiniest smile.

. EDDIE
Did I hear something positive come
out of that mouth 0 yours?

Jack leans in close.

JACK
You need to make it Eddie. For
both of us.

Suddenly red and white lights swirl across the warehouse
walls... Jack turning as an EMT Truck pulls into the
warehouse. TWO Paramedics ex1t the vehicle, engine still

running.

The woman is in her 40’s and carries a weary, battered grace
about her. Her name tag reads: DIANE. The DRIVER is younger
and is following her lead.

Diane kneels over a shivering Eddie without looking at Jack.
Views the wound without expression.

INT. EMT TRUCK

The back doors blowing open as Jack and the DRIVER load
Eddie onto a secured gurney. Wall mounted Medic kit is
popped open. A saline drip is prepared.

90.

Diane cuts off Eddie’s shirt and rolls him onto his side to
find the exit wound.

Small, round burn marks made by cigarettes dot Eddie’s torso.
Years of them. Diane flicks Jack a glance to make sure he’s
seen them, then gets to work.

DIANE 4 .
I don’t know if I can fix this
here.

Takes Eddie’s hand, has_him hold a piece of gauze over the
hole while she grabs a syringe.

Diane injects it into the wound and Eddie winces- Looking at
her more closely.

EDDIE
You’re the lady whose apartment we
were in...
DIANE
(to Jack)

You went to my apartment?

JACK
I needed my gun.

EDDIE
It was very clean.

Diane staring at Jack.

EDDIE (cont’d)
There’s a hole in your Murphy bed.
Other than that...

She tries to continue working, then stops. Eyes boring into
Jack.

IDIANE
I had Police grilling me for an
hour at the hospital.

JACK
What’d you tell them?

DIANE

That we’ve barely spoken in two
years. That you were a self
medicating, depressed indiVidual.
That you didn't care anymore.
About anything or anyone.

(beat)
I told them the truth.

Jack stares at the floor. Eddie very uncomfortable.

DIANE (cont’d)
What’d you do this time, Jack?

91.

EDDIE
Just saved my life three times.
I’m an important witness to police
corruption.

Diane looks to Jack for an explanation but gets none.

EDDIE (cont’d)
He’s a good man, lady. Give him
another chance. He's gonna need
somebody to talk to when I leave.

Jack and Diane stare at each other for several moments.

JACK
Eddie? Meet my sister, Diane

EDDIE
Sister? Shit. For a second there
I had hope for ou. Even your
family don’t li e you.

Diane begins stitching the wound. Eyes wandering to Jack.

EDDIE (cont’d)
Haven’t seen my sister in eleven
years. Lives in Seattle. I’m
supposed to get on a bus tonight to
go see her.

Diane smiles at Eddie but refuses to look at Jack.

DIANE
The bullet missed his carotid. I
did what I could with the mess in
there. He moves around too much I
can’t promise it’ll hold.

Ties it off and cuts. Dresses it. Slides over and takes
Jack’s hand. Undoing the wrap...

DIANE (cont’d)
He really shouldn’t be on his feet.

JACK
A couple blocks.

Diane sighs when she sees the bullet hole.

‘ JACK (cont'd)
I’m gOing to need one more favor,
Di.

EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY

Diane’s EMT truck pulls out of the warehouse and slides onto
Franklin.

92.

INT. BACK OF EMT TRUCK

Jack and Eddie bouncing around on opposite sides. Weariness
oozes from both of them.

EDDIE
And you never told me what you
wanted on your cake.

JACK _
Nothing in my life I want to see in
icing.

EDDIE

Gotta be one thing. Pet, first
car. Special day.

JACK
There are some people who don’t
deserve to have part of their life
decorated on a cake. I’m one of
them.
(beat)
I’m not a good guy, Eddie.

EDDIE

I think you are.
(beat)

But if you don’t think so, then
change. There’s always a another
chance. Third and fourth ones.
I'm proof of that. Just have to be
ready for them. Look for the
signs. Don’t quit.

Jack stares into space at something only he can see.

JACK
There are mistakes you make that
you pay for, for the rest of your
ife. No reprieves. No second
chances.

EDDIE

I don’t believe that.

(beat)
Sometimes we do the right thing for
the wrong reason or the wrong thing
for what we think is the rig t
reason and it doesn’t work out and
we ive up. But if you do the
rig t thing for the right reason it
always turns out good. Maybe not
right away. But eventually...

JACK
Eventually is a bunch of——

93.

EDDIE
Don’t. Let me have this one, Jack.
It’s all I got left to hold on to.

Jack nods, understands. Long silence. Then the Truck starts
to slow down.

EXT. FRANKLIN AND CHURCH - MORNING

Diane’s truck rolling to a stop in front of two unmarked
POLICE CARS blocking the street. Frank Nugent and Jimmy
Mulvey leaning against hoods.

Nugent walking to her side of the truck as Mulvey covers the
driver’s side. Diane rolls down her window, eyes showing
surprise but no fear.

NUGENT
Diane.
DIANE
Frank.
NUGENT
A little out of your sector, aren’t

DIANE

Saving lives knows no boundaries.
You 5 ould know that Frank.

Nugent done being polite.

NUGENT
Step out of the vehicle and open

Nugent flings open the door and pulls her out of the truck.

CARL

This as far as I can get ya. They

JACK AND EDDIE

Moving down Leonard Street. Top of the Courthouse peeking
above the buildings. Not a cop in sight.

EDDIE
Maybe they gave up.

Getting to the corner of Centre and Leonard. Peering out at
the Courthouse...
JACK AND EDDIE'S POV - THE COURTHOUSE

The towering granite monolith with massive columns supporting

the chisele words. . “Only The Just Man Enjoys Peace of
Mind”
And beneath it.... a sea of blue. DOZENS of Uniforms man

barricades that surround the Courthouse entrance. MEDIA VANS
line the edges of Foley Park.

JACK AND EDDIE
Almost breathless from the sight. Jack checking his watch:

9:38

You know the drill.

FITZPATRICK
I see ‘em, I shoot ‘em-

INT. A VERY DARK AREA — SAME TIME

Nugent clipping the radio to his belt then taking out his
Glock. Torres and Mulvey hover in the shadows nearby.

We can’t tell where they are exactly. A blue emergency light
above a fire box the on y illumination.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE

A massive steel columned structure sectioned off and
consuming the square City block.

Jack and Eddie moving through a section containing City
Vehicles and trucks. Just the SOUND of their footsteps and
the hum of fluorescents.

JACK
Used to bring witnesses in this way
to avoid the media. Called it
Gotti Avenue. Hardly used anymore.

They walk towards a set of double doors a hundred yards away.
The reason we can see them in this darkness... Is the blue
emergency light to the left of them.

Walking in silence for a bit. 60 yards away from those
shadows. Both too tired to talk.

Moving for the doors at the other end. Twenty five yards
away. Jack stopping and checking his watch.

96.

9:44
Reaching behind him for his handcuffs.

JACK (cont’dk
I should bring you in right.

Eddie understands. Hold out his arms.

. EDDIE
Think we'll ever see each other
after this?

JACK
Not in this lifetime._ Think of us
as two shits paSSing in the night.

Turning and heading right for the doors. Fifteen yards away.
Moving under a section of giant steel beams...

JACK (cont’d)
Hate this area. You have to watch
out for all those pige——

Looking towards the rafters and seeing them empty... A chill
going down his spine at that exact instant. S oving Eddie
out of the way as gun fire erupts from the shadows.

Jack falling behind a Street Sweeper, firing his .38 blindly.
Firing two more shots and dashing to the other aide to get
Eddie. Finding him behind a snow plow.

INT. PARKING STRUCTURE

Nu ent, Torres and Mulvey step out of the shadows spread out
an advance with precision into the garage.

JACK AND EDDIE

Moving silently between vehicles, staying low. Jack using.
his gun to smash the fluorescents plunging the entire section
into darkness...

Steering Eddie deeper into the cars. Towards the back wall
but away from any way out...
NUGENT, MULVEY AND TORRES

Moving through the rows of cars and trucks parked end to end.
No ta k. No taunts. Just focused on killing and gOing home.
SqueeZing the target area smaller and smaller.

Crawling between a row City Sedans all the same color and

INT. CITY SEDAN

Jack shoves Eddie inside, removes the cuffs then cracks the

FOOTSTEPS ECHO away. Neither on noticing the r not

Staying low and moving away from Eddie. Seeing under the

Mulvey’s ankle bone shatters as he goes down hard. Torres
and Nugent turning towards the SOUND. Moving towards Jack
from two directions.

JACK

Leading them farther and farther from Eddie.

TORRES

Standing still and silent in the shadows. Catches sight of
Jack’s igure moving into the row of SNOW PLOWS. Mov1ng
parallel and coming at Jack from his blind side.

Seeing Jack disappear behind one. Moving down on the other

Never seeing the Plow door swing 0 en. Hitting Torres hard
on the shou der, knocking him to t e cement. Jack out and
slamming his gun to Torres skull before he can turn.

NUGENT

Hearing Torres go down. Starin into the black of the

JACK

Crouched behind two Vehicles, willing Nugent to stalk him.

JACK
(to himself)
Come on...

NUGENT

Staring into the shadows. Sensing Jack’s osition. _ Starts

bat... Seeing the door of a parked sedan ajar two rows over.

INT. CITY SEDAN

Eddie laying frozen on the back floor.

NUGENT

Moving down the aisle towards the Sedan.

NUGENT
You could be a hundred feet away.
The two of ya will never get

JACK
You have it half right.

Checks his watch. 9:50

A SOUND and FATHER JERRY CONNELLY, 5D, emerges from his

tough, even in his priestly get—up.

Stops when Jack steps out of the shadows.

FATHER CONNELLY (cont’d)

JACK (cont’d)
Good uy.

Very good guy.

Father Connelly now looking into Jack’s eyes.

Only now I’m going to get me. And
him.

Eddie listening. Jack stares up at the ceiling.

JACK (cont’d)

I was one of them. One of the
team. And I was in that room when
that old man died. I was on his
couch when Frank stuck that gun in
his mouth.

(beat)
Mr. Ling. Remember his name Frank?

lOI.

Adjusting

Nugent saying nothing. Jack’s words coming harder now.

JACK (cont’d)
I sat there as Frank told the old
man that he didn’t see what he saw.
I watched Frank et more and more
pissed because t e guy wouldn’t
change his story. Not understanding
why the police are asking him to
lie. Frank screaming at him...
Next thing I know Frank’s got the
barrel of his gun in the guy’s
mouth, hammer back.

The searing, painful images flying through Jack’s head.

JACK (cont'd)
I’m screaming at Frank to cool down
when he... just fall.

102.

Tears starting to show.

JACK (cont’d)
That old man was doing the right
thing. He was telling the truth.
And e’s dead because of it.

Jack staring into space.

JACK (cont’d)
Walked out of there and never said
a word. Not that day. Not the
next. Not ever. Frank knew I
wouldn’t. Because he trained me to
be just like him. Only he could
forget it. And I couldn’t.

Looks down at Nugent.

JACK (cont’d)

I looked back and realized I was
heading for that night for a long
time. Making my own rules or
following his. Until I was as
broken and corrupt as him.

(beat)
I didn’t care after that night.
About me or anything.

The last words echo through the church. For a while no one
speaks.

EDDIE
But you stayed a cop.

Jack looking up.

EDDIE (cont’d)

I mean you didn’t retire. Take a
pension and disappear. Deep down
you knew if you eft, you’d never
tell. And he’d win.

(beat)
I wasn’t meant to meet you. You
were meant to meet me. This is
where you’re supposed to be.

Jack finally looks at Eddie but can find no words.

EDDIE (cont’d)
This is your other chance Jack.
You knew that back in that bar.
Only now it’s for the right reason.

CHURCH DOORS opening and Father Connelly coming in.

FATHER CONNELLY
It’s all set. You tell them
Detective Nugent’s whereabouts and
you’ll get your say. Deals off you
get there a minute past ten.

103.

' JACK
Just saying good—bye.

FATHER CONNELLY
I suggest leaving through my
private quarters. It’l leave you
out near Sixth Avenue. Far away
from what’s out there.

Jack smiles. Walks Eddie to a set of doors behind the alter.

JACK
Hope you make it.
EDDIE
I will. It’s meant to be Jack.

(beat) |
I’ll call you sometime.

JACK
Don’t. That way I won’t know if
on fucked up again. And I can
elieve what I want.

In spite of the pain... Eddie smiles. That same damn smile
he had when we first met him in that cell ninety—eight
minutes ago.

EDDIE
Aw Jack. There you go being
negative again.

Turns to go.

JACK
Hey.

Eddie stopping.

JACK (cont’d)
What’s the answer?

EDDIE

Give the keys to your best friend,
let him drive the old lady to the

hospital while you stay at the bus
stop with the woman of my dreams.

(beat)

Gotta figure if you were destined
to find er, you ll be okay.

Jack smiles.

JACK
Damn.

And Eddie’s gone.

104.

EXT. COURTHOUSE PLAZA

A COMMOTION taking place around the steps. Commissioner
Keenan, DA WALTER HAGEN, Swat Commander Sheehan as well as
ADA MacDonald and his staff. Heated discussions exploding
into SHOUTING.

The large clock showing:

9:56

INT. CHURCH

Jack standing with Father Connelly, taking a deep breath and
looking back at Frank Nugent.

NUGENT
You’re going ruin the lives of six
great cops so you can feel good-

JACK
I’ll never feel good. And that’s
what I'll have to live with.

NUGENT
Then what for?

JACK .
Because there’s gotta be a line.
EXT. ST. FRANCIS CHURCH — MORNING

ROWS and ROWS of New York City POLICEMEN stand waiting.
AVIATION UNITS hover in overhead, K~9 and Emergency Services
line the block.

And outside of that, yellow police tape cordons off
SPECTATORS who line t e sidewalk six deep.

Slowly the church doors 0 en. Father Connelly emerges
first, Jack right behind im.
JACK'S POV

The sea of blue UNIFORMS forming a gauntlet all the way to
the courthouse. Across the street on the massive granite
steps, everybody waits.

EXT. COURTHOUSE PLAZA

Every eye trained on the two as they start for the
courthouse. The sea of blue UNIFORMS begin to part as they
reach Centre Street and start across.

105.

EXT. COURTHOUSE ROOF

Ray Fitzpatrick cradles his Maunz 308 Assault rifle and
stares t rough the Hauser scope waiting for Jack to step into
View...

COURTHOUSE PLAZA

Jack feeling the stares from every blue Uniform as he closes
in on the Courthouse. Staring up at the flocks of pigeons
and without knowing it.... he begins to hum.

FATHER CONNELLY
Oh. Part of the deal is when
you’re able you have to attend my
mass on a regular basis.

JACK
That’s blackmail. Deal’s off.

FATHER CONNELLY
Then may perpetual light shine on
your hairy ass.

Jack smiling now. Almost over.

COURTHOUSE ROOF

Ray Fitzpatrick zeroing in... crosshairs finding Jack.
Finger ready to squeeze... Movement of Father Connelly
causing uncertainty... Blocking a clean shot.

And suddenly he’s clear. Crosshairs between Jack’s eyes.
BLAM.

COURTHOUSE PLAZA

Jack still humming when the PIGEON EXPLODES just in front of
him. Everyone hitting the ground as OFFICERS and SWAT look

up at where the shot came from. Sheehan SCREAMING OVER HIS

RADIO.

Ray Fitzpatrick stunned as OTHER SWAT TEAM MEMBERS race to
his spot and grab his weapon.

Jack crumpling to the ground. All feeling leaving his body.
Blurred faces going white... SOUNDS far away and muffled.
Eyes staring into white light, feeling nothing anymore. No
pain, no fear. Just peace.

Then a gust of wind is sucked into his lungs. Faces slowly
drift back into focus. Father Connelly saying something but
Jack can't hear him.

106.

FATHER CONNELLY (OS)
Jack?

Father Connelly kneeling down... Jack opening his eyes now.
Slowly being helped to his feet. A CRISP UNIFORM helping

Father Connelly.

Jack looking down at what’s left of the pigeon and wincing..
Only now un erstanding. The bullet deflected into his 1e t

shoulder by a flying rat.

Father Connelly and the Crisp Uniform lead Jack towards the
Courthouse steps. Jack sta gering up the final ste 5 alone
and finding himself before A HAGEN and ADA MacDona d and
Commissioner Wagner.

WAGNER
Where’s Detective Nugent.
JACK
Church.
DA HAGEN
Where’s my witness. Where’s Mr.
Bunker.

Jack slowly looks at all three men. Up at the clock.

9:57.

JACK
Mr. Bunker’s no longer with us.

Hagen's face goes red.

JACK (cont'd)

I’ll be taking his place.

(off their looks)
I have information pertaining to
the witness tampering investigation
dating back four years. Names,
cases and dates. Including charges
of extortion and manslaughter.

Stgnned silence. The magnitude starting to be understood by
a .

ADA MACDONALD
What do you want Mosley? What are
you looking for?

JACK
Expunge Bunker’s record. Wipe it
clean. Like he never existed.

ADA MACDONALD
Done. What else?

107.

JACK
Just some peace. You got any left
in there?

And on those words Jack’s led inside and the large doors of
100 Centre Street close.

EXT. ALLENWOOD CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - LATE AFTERNOON

White concrete buildings in the middle of nowhere surrounded
by acres of chain link fences and razor wire.

The Visitors Yard is full of FAMILIES and INMATES. The HORN
SOUNDS endin visiting time. We spot Jack walking towards
the gate wit Diane. He looks hea ed and healthy, having.
dropped a few pounds. She holds his hands and looks at him
wit a mixture of worry and pride.

JACK
You love him?

DIANE
I do. He makes me happY: Jack.

JACK
Then I’m happy.

They get to the gate.

DIANE
We both decided the wedding can
wait till you get out.

JACK

You’re not worried he might change
his mind in the next nine months.

Diane smiles and hugs him.
DIANE
See you next month.
INT. ALLENWOOD CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
Dorm like rooms with steel and lass doors that line both
sides of a wide hallway. All 0 them open now...
INT. JACK’S CELL
10x10 with a desk, cot and sink. A small window with bars
sits above the sink. Jack tossing bird seed to some pigeons

perched on the ledge outside.

The SOUND of mail being tossed inside his rooms Several
magaZines, two letters and a small UPS box. Jack taking the
box and looking at it. Cuts it open and takes out...

108.

A cake.

Decorated like a monopoly board. Only instead of Park Place
and Broadway the squares are Baxter Street, Lafayette, the
5th Precinct, St. Francis Church and 100 Centre Street.
Sixteen blocks worth of wonderfully decorated and colorful
squares.

Jack not sure if he’s going to laogh or cry. Sliding his
finger across the bottom and tasting the icing.

JACK
Son of a bitch...

Taking it and walking out into the hall.
. JACK (cont’d)

Bernie. Ted. You guys got to try

this.
Not noticing the picture fall from the box onto the floor.
But we do. It’s Eddie. Standing in front of a small
storefront with hand painted letters on the window. Wearing
a Chef’s hat.

And that smile.
FADE TO BLACK
