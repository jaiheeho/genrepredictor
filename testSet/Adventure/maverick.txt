AS the SONG FINISHES 7*
*7 CREDITS COME TO AN END.

And the movie begins...

FADE IN ON:

EXT. DESOLATE LANDSCAPE 7 HANGING TREE 7 DAY

Rocks. Cactus. The occasional tree.

Not a place you'd like to spend your summer vacation.

Now there are sounds: A WHIPPING WIND begins to get
LOUDER. And in the distance, but GROWING: THUNDER.

CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE 7*

SLOWLY, INEXORABLY, ACROSS this dead place if

7* suddenly it STOPS.

We are in a Sergio Leone TIGHT CLOSEUP of just a hideous7
1ooking man. One eye looks straight ahead. The other
wanders.

CAMERA MOVES AGAIN.

The wind is really kicking up if

7* suddenly, another STOP.

Another Leone CLOSEUP.

A second man. This guy makes the first one look
handsome. Both his eyes work, which is an improvement.
But his neck has been horribly burned as if from a noose.
CAMERA IS MOVING AGAIN.

LOUDER THUNDER. A storm is coming fast.

CAMERA STOPS.

We are LOOKING AT the least appetizing of the three. Not
that he's scarred, not that all his parts aren't in
proper working order ,, it's just that he's so damn
frightening.

Not to mention huge.

This is THE ANGEL and like the other two, he is seated on
a horse. And he is staring intently at something. FROM
The Ange1 ,, we go to...

BRET MAVERICK

for this is who the trio is looking at.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MAVERICK's 30, give or take. Enormously appealing.
Whether that's because of his considerable physical
skills or his sunny personality, who knows. It might
be his quiet wit.

In any case, we are looking at a handsome young man that
everybody likes ,,

7* oops 7*
77 make that almost everybody.

Because just now he is seated on a horse beneath a tree
and a thick hope has been tied around his neck, the rope
thrown over a branch. His hands have been tied behind
his back. We are about to watch a hanging. His.

THE ANGEL

(riding closer)
I almost got hung myself once,
didn't much care for it, how about
you?

(as Maverick

says nothing)
We're gonna leave now, but I'm
worried about your wellibeing.

Maverick just stares at him, makes no reply.
THE ANGEL

He gestures for the other two to ride, and they take
off.

THE ANGEL
See, I don't think it's a good
thing for a man to be alone out

here. Your mind can do cruel
things.
And now he takes a burlap sack, tosses it toward
Maverick. It lands nearby.
THE ANGEL

Enjoy the company.
He spurs his horse, rides away.
MAVERICK

managing to turn his head in the direction The Angel
took.

EXT. SKY 7 DAY 2
The sky. Storm clouds convene.
EXT. HANGING TREE 7 DAY 3

Maverick. He takes a deep breath, tries to wriggle
free of the knotted rope around his neck.

No luck.
Make that bad luck.

The horse has been surprised by his movement, takes a
half step.

MAVERICK

Freezing.

HORSE

It relaxes, settles down.

EXT. SKY 7 DAY 4
The sky, and a THUNDERCLAP.

EXT. HANGING TREE 7 DAY 5
Maverick, staring at his horse. The noise was loud.

Either the horse is deaf or it likes thunder. Doesn't
budge an inch.

Maverick starts to try and work his neck free again.
This time the horse doesn't move at all.

Maverick sighs with relief, glances around.

BURLAP SACK

It is starting to wrigg1e.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 5
MAVERICK

He holds his breath.

HORSE

It hasn't spotted the sack yet.

SACK

Wrigg1ing more. Pretty soon it's going to be hard
not to spot it.

MAVERICK

caution to the winds now, trying desperately to
somehow get free of the noose 77

77 and miraculously, he's starting to make a little
headway.

HORSE

Calm. Nothing flusters this animal.

MAVERICK
even more headway 77 he's in pain but he ignores it.
EXT. SKY 7 DAY 6

The sky. More THUNDER.

EXT. HANGING TREE 7 DAY 7
The horse. Standing still.

EXT. SKY 7 DAY 8

The clouds are darker.

EXT. HANGING TREE 7 DAY 9
The horse. It could be a statue.
MAVERICK

neck. Now 77

Close by. Some of them are big, some of them are very
big. A11 of them have fangs.

MAVERICK

struggling harder than ever, and he's actually making
more headway. It's exhausting labor. As he continues
his fight for life 77

MAVERICK (V.O.)
It had been just a shitty week for
me from the beginning.

NOW, FROM that 77
FLASHBACK 7 EXT. ROAD 7 LONG LENS 7 AFTERNOON 9A

A 1one rider rides through dusty area up and down dips
in the road. It is Maverick. He rides a mule. Angel
follows and then Coop follows.

EXT. DUSTY CANYON 7 AFTERNOON 9B

Maverick rides his mu1e a1ong dusty trail; as we PAN WITH
him a wagon train travels in opposite direction; kids
play poker in the f.g. 77 one smokes a corn cob pipe; we
CONTINUE PAN WITH Maverick and REVEAL the town of Crystal
River, a ferry coming across the river in the b.g.

MAVERICK (V.O.)
I was heading into Crystal River
to take some money from the bank.
Probably I should have expected
bad luck on the horizon when my
horse got stolen and I had to
replace it with something less
than a thoroughbred.

EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER 7 AFTERNOON 10
Crystal River. Not much of a place. Dusty. One main
street 77 and almost every storefront indicates that it

is either a saloon or a gambling ha11.

Just now the stagecoach comes off the ferry and drives
through town kicking up dust.

EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER 7 AFTERNOON 10A

Maverick, riding into town from the other direction, as
the dust whips up. He's wearing different clothes than
in the hanging scene.

MAVERICK (V.O.)
My 1uck had to change fast 77 the
poker game of the century was
starting in St. Louis in just ten
days, and I was still short three
thousand for the entrance fee.

OMITTED (STABLE SCENE MOVED TO 11B) 10B
EXT. BANK 7 AFTERNOON ll

Maverick rides toward the bank, stops. A sign in front
indicates "Closed 'ti1 Morning."

NONE 11A
EXT. STABLES 7 AFTERNOON 11B

A stable as Maverick dismounts, does his best to beat
some dust from his riding clothes. He grabs his
sadd1ebag as a STABLE BOY hurries up.

MAVERICK
(indicating the mu1e)
How much?

STABLE BOY
By the day, week or month?

MAVERICK
No7no 77 Not how much to take
care of him, how much to just
take him. Permanently.

STABLE BOY
Pa. The man wants to sell the
burro.

PA
That burro's not worth a cent.

How 'bout the saddle?

PA
Five do11ars.

MAVERICK
Five do11ars. Nice doing business
with you. Thank you. He doesn't
eat much. He's a regular jackass
... Hee... haw... Hee... haw.
A1ways likes to be called Arthur.

He opens the door. He bumps into Ange1. They look at
each other. Maverick exits and Angel looks and moves
inside.
CUT TO:
EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE 7 AFTERNOON 12

The biggest establishment in town. This place actually
has a second floor and advertises rooms as well as vices.

INT. CRYSTAL PALACE 7 STAIRCASE 7 AFTERNOON l3

Maverick is starting up the stairs when the REGISTRATION
CLERK hurries over from his desk.

CLERK
You got a wire, want me to read it
to you?
MAVERICK
(reaching for it)
NO.
CLERK
(reading)
It just says, 'Watch your back.’

(beat)
No signature.

(hands it over)
Here.

Maverick takes it, glances at it, heads upstairs.
EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER 7 SUNSET 13A

The town and river look beautiful as the sun is going
down.

14

INT. CRYSTAL PALACE 7 DUSK 14
The place is busy enough, the bar doing a brisk business.
A poker game is in session. Half a dozen play. A

catt1ehand, a preacher, a sma117time Ioca1 businessman.
But it's the other three we pay most attention to.

First is a very young man. Late teens, Iooks 1ess.
Thin. Sma11. A hundred and thirty pounds after a big
meal. This is THE KID. Seems ordinary.

Next to him sits, of all things, a woman. But not
ordinary, certainly not in these surroundings. She's
e1egant1y7dressed, close to being beautiful. She's
married, has a deep Southern accent, and hasn't been
poor for a long time. Maybe she's thirty. She seems
a rotten poker player, but a wonderful f1irt. This
is ANNABELLE BRANSFORD.

Next to her sits The Angel. We met him already 77 he
tossed the bur1ap bag of ratt1esnakes at Maverick just
before the hanging. Huge, powerfu1, not much makes him
smi1e, except winning at cards.

There is an empty seat at the table.
STAIRCASE

as Maverick descends. If before he was grimy from
travel, he isn't anymore. He wears a black hat, a black
jacket, a black string tie 77

77 and just the most beautiful white 1ace shirt you ever
saw.

POKER GAME
as Maverick approaches.

MAVERICK
(indicating the
empty chair)
Taken?

ANNABELLE
(1i1ting Southern
accent)
It is now.
(smiles at him)
My name is Annabe11e Bransford.
And what do people call you?

MAVERICK
Bret Maverick, ma'm.

And as he starts to sit 77
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 14
THE ANGEL

glaring at Maverick. (We know that within a week,
he'11 hang Maverick. But they haven't met before.)

THE ANGEL
I like the game the way it is.

MAVERICK
I bring all kinds of p1usses to
the table. I hardly ever b1uff and
I never ever cheat.

THE ANGEL
I don't believe it.

MAVERICK
Neither do I.

THE ANGEL
(voice rising, not
in pitch, but
intensity)
I like the game just the way it
is.

MAVERICK
Bet I can change your mind.
(beat)
I promise to lose for at least
an hour.
THE ANGEL
(without a pause)
We're playing five card draw.
As Maverick sits 77
MAVERICK
losing a hand to The Angel. The Angel smiles 77
77 but so does Maverick.
MAVERICK
1osing again, this time to Annabe11e. She's happy 77
77 but again, so is Maverick.
And now we begin a SERIES of VERY QUICK CUTS.
Of The kid, holding his cards. Tightly.

(CONTINUED)

14

14A

14B

CONTINUED: (2) 14
Of the catt1eman casua11y making a bet. Very casua11y.

Of Maverick, who doesn't seem to be paying much
attention.

He Ioses again, smiles.

Now the preacher is staring at his cards before betting.
For a long beat.

And the catt1eman is fiddling with his chips.

The chips in front of The Angel are sloppy.

The chips in front of Annabe11e are neatly stacked. She
f1icks her fingernai1s against her front teeth, makes a
bet.

The businessman is toying with his necktie.

The Angel is holding his cards, moving the top to the
bottom, then repeating, the top to the bottom.

And Maverick 1oses again, smiles again, just happy to
be there.

Annabe11e is suddenly he1p1ess, giggling, staring at
what she's been dealt.

The Angel is smiling happi1y. He rakes in a pot.
The businessman's fingers are tapping on the table.
The Kid's hand covers his mouth.

The Angel is bored, looking neither at the other players
or the pot.

Annabe11e bets big and wins 77 maybe she's not such a
rotten poker player after all.

Maverick tosses in his cards. Another Ioss. He smiles,
glances at the clock on the wall 77 an hour and a half
have gone by.

EXT. CRYSTAL RIVER 7 TWILIGHT 14A

It is getting dark. Fewer people move about. A 1amp7
1ighter is at work; carriages pass with 1anterns lit.

INT. CRYSTAL PALACE 7 TWILIGHT 14B

The table. Maverick and the kid are the last two in the
game. The kid turns his cards over.

(CONTINUED)

14B

10.
CONTINUED: 14B

Two pair, aces over queens. Maverick has three sixes.
He looks at his winning hand almost in surprise. It's a
good sized pot he's won. As he reaches for it.

THE KID
(mumbling something)
Don't think...

The rest is unintelligible.

MAVERICK
Didn't get you.

THE KID
I said I don't think that hand
should count.

MAVERICK
You got any logical reasons going
for you?

THE KID

My mind wasn't on the game.
His voice is always soft.
CLOSEUP 7 THE KID

He stares at Maverick and something is suddenly clear:
His eyes are deadly.

MAVERICK
Hesitating now.

MAVERICK
What's your name, son?

THE KID
Johnny Hardin.

MAVERICK
And what do you do for a living?

THE KID
Oh, mostly I kill people. I'm a
gunfighter.

MAVERICK

Since you're still alive, I have
to assume you're good at it.

THE KID
Care to find out?

(CONTINUED)

14B

11.

CONTINUED: (2) 14B
MAVERICK
(a beat 77 then)
This hand definitely does not
count.

(indicating chips)
Take whatever you think's yours,
I'll be content with the leavings.

As The Kid does 77

ANNABELLE

A quick look of disappointment crosses her face.
THE ANGEL

A look of contempt crosses his.

THE ANGEL
You always been gutless?

MAVERICK

(thinks a minute 77

then nods)
I think so. At least for as long
as I can remember. My pappy
always said, 'He who fights and
runs away, can run away another
day.'

(now he stands 77

like every other

man in the room, he

wears a six gun)
Here's the truth 77 I don't see
what's so great about being brave.

Pulls back his black jacket, clearing his gun.
KID

Watching. His hand begins to move to his gun.
ANNABELLE

This is not a nice place.

TABLE

All watching Maverick now.

(CONTINUED)

14B

12.
CONTINUED: (3) 14B

MAVERICK
(chatting idly away)
See, you're a gunfighter and I'm
not, I like to play cards, so the
fact is, if I'd faced you down,
what chance would I have had?
Answer? Zero.

MAVERICK

suddenly he draws 77 and it's lightning 77 you never saw
anyone so fast.

THE KID

Stunned.

MAVERICK

His voice casual.

MAVERICK
No chance whatsoever.

And now he expertly twirls his gun back into its
holster.

ANNABELLE
Leaning toward The Kid.

ANNABELLE
Was that fast?
(as The Kid manages
a nod)
I thought it was fast.

MAVERICK

sitting back down at the table again. This has all gone
quickly and quietly. Now he looks at The Kid.

MAVERICK
May I suggest that from now on
you keep your mind on the game?

THE KID
Yes. Yessir.

MAVERICK
My deal?

(CONTINUED)

l3.
CONTINUED: (4) 14B
THE ANGEL
Not remotely afraid of Maverick.

THE ANGEL
You say you like to play cards?

MAVERICK
Passionately.

THE ANGEL
How come, when you lose all the
time?

MAVERICK
Oh, I don't lose all the time 77
just the first hour or so. I like

for people to be happy.

THE ANGEL
What happens after that?

MAVERICK
Probably I'll win all your money.

THE ANGEL
Aren't you a little overconfident?

MAVERICK
No. I've just been here before.

POKER GAME BEGINNING AGAIN
And again, we see a SERIES OF VERY QUICK CUTS.

In fact, we see many of the same cuts we saw before 77
only this time, Maverick doesn't lose, he wins.

The Kid holds his cards tightly. Too tightly. He makes
a bet. Maverick doubles it. The Kid folds. He was
bluffing.

The Cattleman casually makes a bet. Very casually.
Maverick doubles it. Another bluff. Maverick wins again.

Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling.

Maverick folds. The others bet. Annabelle wins 77 she
wasn't bluffing.

The Angel is guarding his cards with both huge hands. He
makes a big bet. Maverick makes a bigger one. The Angel
folds. Angrily. He was bluffing.

(CONTINUED)

14B

14.
CONTINUED: (5) 14B
The Businessman is playing with his tie. He bets.
Maverick makes a big raise. The Businessman calls. They
both have good hands. But Maverick's is better.
The Angel is bored, makes a bet looking at neither the
other players nor the pot. Maverick makes a big bet. The
Angel throws his cards down, his anger building as he was
caught in another bluff.
CLOCK
Time is passing.
POKER GAME

Maverick has cleaned out everybody but The Angel.

The Angel hesitates, moving the top card to the bottom,
does it again, moves the top card to the bottom 77

77 now he makes a bet.
Now Maverick makes a bet. A huge bet.
THE ANGEL

scowling, staring.

MAVERICK

Nothing shows on his face. He just waits. Then 77

THE ANGEL

He wants to bet but you can tell it in his eyes 77 he's

scared he's not strong enough.
MAVERICK

The others are watching. Annabelle smiles at him. He
politely touches the rim of his hat.

THE ANGEL

he hurls his cards to the table. Maverick wins.

MAVERICK

putting his cards face down, starting to collect the pot.
THE ANGEL

suddenly reaching out, grabbing Maverick's cards,
turning them over 77

MAVERICK'S CARDS
He has shit. Not even a pair. This time he was bluffing.
THE ANGEL
on his feet with a roar 77

THE ANGEL
You said you never bluffed!

MAVERICK
(very calm,
collecting the pot)
No, I said I never cheated, and I

don't. I also said I hardly ever
bluffed. This was one of the
'hardlys.'

THE ANGEL

You cheated the whole goddam game.

MAVERICK

What do you think I was doing
that first hour? Learning your
'tells,' that's all. Once I could
read your hands, once I could read
you 77

(shrugs)
77 things just kind of worked out.

THE ANGEL
I just called you a 'cheat.'

MAVERICK
You also called me gutless. I
figured you were teasing 77

THE ANGEL

blind mad. He reaches his huge arms across, starts to
grab Maverick.

INT. CRYSTAL PALACE 7 NIGHT l5

FOUR UNSHAVEN BIG MEN bursting through the front door of
the place, the LEAD GUY has his gun drawn 77

LEAD GUY

looking for a place to move.

FOUR UNSHAVEN BIG MEN

Three of them fanning out behind the Lead Guy, blocking
anyplace Maverick might go.

LEAD GUY
I spotted ya through the window
and it made me believe in The
Almighty.

MAVERICK
You fellas were drinking, you
played bad, whose fault is that?

LEAD GUY
Yours, bastard 77 everything is
your fault.

But it's our time come now.
They advance.
MAVERICK

swinging front doors 77

FOUR GUYS

MAVERICK

taking advantage of the moment, sprinting away and 77
FOUR

realizing now, turning, starting after him and 77
MAVERICK

THE ANGEL AND ANNABELLE AND THE OTHERS

rivited.

FOUR GUYS

outside 77 they stop too.

MAVERICK

He turns now, turns to face them.

THE ANGEL AND OTHERS

watching as the Four Guys stare at Maverick, wary, ready
for anything.

MAVERICK
MAVERICK *

Hey, son. Take this. If they *
get to whooping me, just shoot me. *
Take care of this and make sure it *
doesn't get dirty. *

And now he does something else surprising. He takes off

his gun belt and his coat and gives them to the boys. *

FOUR GUYS

Three of them look to the Lead Guy. He hesitates, drops

his gun belt too.

THE ANGEL

watching. *

And now the Four Men begin to move slowly toward Maverick.
MAVERICK

Four of them and all of them dangerous, four of them
coming closer in the night.

And now he does the most surprising thing of all:
He charges them.

night, and 77

MAVERICK

spinning, throwing an elbow into the gut of the nearest
big man. The blow connects perfectly and the Guy starts
to double over, his knees weak, and he falls.

SECOND BIG MAN

swinging viciously and he knows how to use his fists 77
77 but he's slow, too slow.

MAVERICK

ducking the blow, coming up with a punch of his own that
lands on the side of the jaw and the guy staggers back
and down.

THE KID

watching and probably he's never seen anything like this,
one guy attacking four.

THE ANGEL

and for just a moment now, as he stares out almost in
disbelief, there's something new behind his eyes: Fear.

MAVERICK

leaving his feet, kicking out with both legs at the third
guy, crunching him in the chest, sending him careening
back, cartwheeling to earth.

LEAD GUY

he hadn't expected this and as Maverick sags 77

Guy over his head and through the air where he lands,
hard.

MAVERICK

moving back on the First Guy, the one he creamed the air
out of and as he approaches, the First Guy turns, runs.

LEAD GUY

picks up his gun belt, straps it on as he heads back
toward the frontier.

just done. Breathing heavily, sure, a little dusty,
absolutely, but no more.

Annabelle hurries tO him.

MAVERICK
All right 77 my shirt's damaged,

Angel)

77 you were saying something?

ANNABELLE

was it.
THE ANGEL

77 never said such a thing 77

gutless cheat, yes, but I would

never call a man a coward 77
(hopefully)

77 and I was teasing.

Maverick studies the bigger man for a moment. Then,

any worse than when we first met him except now he is
dead. Plus, being dead, he's not grabbing hold of any7
thing that's of any use to Maverick, so his body begins
sliding along the seat and 77

letting go of the dead driver, grabbing the rail with
both hands, forcing himself up to the seat just as the
dead driver starts to fall off it 77

77 but not before Maverick can grab him, pull him back on
so now they're both on the driver's seat, Maverick reach7
ing for the reins, which brings the dead driver's arms
around his neck.

MAVERICK

doing his best to ignore the corpse and take control of
the reins 77

77 which at last, thank God, he does 77

I could do that, absolutely 77 but

A strong, firm voice echoing out over the rough land.

These ponies have been shod.
Indians don't shoe their horses.

ANNABELLE
They could have been stolen.
What's with you and Indians
anyway?

MAVERICK

Yeah, you're right. They're just
a bunch of theives and savages.
Don't get me wrong. I mean we've

Maverick grumbles to himself and ducks under a low
branch. Annabelle pushes it aside, snapping it back
into Coop's face. He blinks a couple of times then
moves stoically forward.

MAVERICK
(turning to
Annabelle)
I don't split my bounty with
anybody.

At that moment Annabelle loses her footing on the trail

onto his gunbelt, as she tries to keep her balance.

MAVERICK
The man who'll blow your brains

know he's old and decrepit and he
guns his food and his women. But
he can still shoot straight.

Johnny Hardin's out for you. You

gunfighter. And he's not dead,

Why this fuss? 'Cause some Indians
killed some whites attacking a wagon
train. I believe that, but some of
the women, you know how hysterical
they can get, think it might have
been whites masquerading. Silliest
thing I ever heard of. Besides, no
fool of a woman could recognize a
man in war paint on horseback anyway.
So all this is going to cost you is
a few hours of beauty sleep.

Near the wagon as Joseph arrives. It is ornate, filled
with artwork of all kinds, clearly Russian in origin.
An ARTIST, VILMOS, is painting. The Archduke comes out.

ARCHDUKE
Where's the waterfall?

VILMOS
I make nature more beautiful.

He's the kind of guy if he wasn't so rich and powerful,
you'd want to clobber. Spoiled beyond belief, the prO7
duct of decades of inbreeding, he is reminiscent of Peter
Ustinov in Quo Vadis when he played Nero.

Five... thousand dollars.

Would we have to tie him up? That

Him loose. But easy hit. Dying

Deal.

Later in the afternoon.

Maverick, magnificently painted to look like an Indian,

Who else? Did you fix his gun?

JOSEPH
Couldn't 77 he never let it out of

I got him up to five hundred

MAVERICK

Worth the risk. Okay. Let's go.

JOSEPH
250 apiece.

MAVERICK

What do you need 250 for?

PULL BACK to reveal...

the MAGICIAN, for that, we will learn, is the name of the
woman we are looking at.

Little old woman, more precisely.

Weird7looking little old woman, more precisely still. She
is dressed in clothing that neither fits nor matches.

When she talks, she talks very loudly. Clearly she
doesn't get a lot of company. Right now she isn't
talking at all, just staring at Maverick's still body.

Mounted on her strange little cart is the biggest buffalo
gun you ever saw. It is what blasted the tree branch to
the ground. And smoke still drifts out of the barrel and
hangs in the air.

Now she takes a foot, pushes Maverick over so he's on his
back.

Next she aims the huge weapon at Maverick's heart.

The Magician is finishing shuffling. She plops them
down on the tree trunk, makes a neat pile.

PULL BACK to reveal:

MAVERICK AND THE MAGICIAN

seated across from each other. The snakes are all around
77 they seem fascinated, all of them facing the tree
trunk.

Maverick eyes the snakes 77 they don't do much for his
peace of mind or his confidence 77 but clearly, he has

no confidence anyway.

THE MAGICIAN

She places the wad of money next to the cards, gestures

for Maverick to start. He hesitates, then 77
MAVERICK
He starts breathing more deeply. It's almost as if

he's trying to enter a different state. He stares

THE MAGICIAN
Well, quit it!

CLOSEUP 7 MAVERICK
He puts his hands in his lap.
It's as if he's trying to go into a deep trance now.

He's breathing deeply. And now something strange: the
wind turns into MUSIC. A gorgeous theme. It plays on.

THE MAGICIAN

caught up in it, watching. The snakes seems caught
up in it too 77 they aren't watching the cards anymore;
they're turned to Maverick.

MAVERICK

And now he closes his eyes. His breathing grows very
deep. The wind MUSIC is louder, more beautiful.

He drops his hands into his lap.
His head lolls back 77 and suddenly the music is gone 77
77 his eyes open, he shakes his head.

MAVERICK
I was trying to go somewhere
in my mind. Couldn't.

THE MAGICIAN
I was watching 77 you were getting
into a trance 77 you were almost
there.

MAVERICK
(dubious)
You just want it to happen, that's
all 77 nothing felt right.

THE MAGICIAN
You give up too fast 77 if magic
was easy, everyone would do it.
You want to win that poker thing,
don't you?

MAVERICK
I do.

THE MAGICIAN
Well, you're not gonna win nothing
without a spot deep inside that
tells you it's okay. A spot that
says, 'Be a fool if you want, just
be the best fool around, and I'll
stay with you forever.’

MAVERICK
I don't want to be a fool.

THE MAGICIAN
You think when I was little and
playing with dolls I thought, 'I
can't wait to grow up so I can be
a hermit and have rattlesnakes for
friends?’

THE MAGICIAN

THE MAGICIAN

I was whipped and beaten and left to
die and I could have, but that spot
talked to me, it told me, 'No,
don't let the world piss on you,
it's okay to live alone, rattlers
don't talk back and they're more
honest than most people, get a
move on.'

(beat)
Now I'm a great hermit and I
wouldn't be nothing else.

They have been watching The Magician. Now they look
at Maverick.

MAVERICK

MAVERICK
(soft)
I was whipped and beaten and left
to die.

THE MAGICIAN
Point of my story.

For a moment, he doesn't move at all. Then he sits
deeper in the chair again, closes his eyes, breathes
deep, deeper. The wind MUSIC is back.

77 cut the ace of spades 77

77 at least that's what we think.

But on second glance, it's clear he's missed. The Magi7
cian holds the ace of clubs.

MAVERICK

Eyes open now, sees he's failed again. The wind music is
dead, gone. Exhausted, he stares.

THE MAGICIAN

and she's never looked happy before. She grabs the
money, shoves it at Maverick.

THE MAGICIAN
Give you my best horse too.

MAVERICK
Why? I failed again. You were
wrong about me.

Annabelle has never been through anything like this and

she tries to relax her body, takes a very deep breath,

rubs her eyes.

(In truth, these marathon poker games were brutal for the
participants. The physical strain never stopped growing.
Their backs ached from slouching in the chairs for long
hours, their arms ached from leaning against the arms of

the chairs; their skin got soggy, their eyes got so it

was just damn hard to keep them open, much less concen7

the bottom, sometimes the second card, sometimes the
third, and sometimes from the middle of the deck which is
brutally hard.

I'll be damned... I'll be damned.
I know a little something about
money 77 made a lot in my lifetime,

gonna make a lot more. But this
young man has more wisdom now about
what's really valuable than I'll
ever have. I had two wives leave
me on account of my obsession with
making money.

Annabelle, her eyes closed.

She's in Maverick's room and he is taking off her suit
coat. He lays it over a chair. She stands as before,
skirt and expensive blouse.

ANNABELLE
When can I open my eyes? 77 what
is this gift I'm getting?

MAVERICK

as he suddenly grabs her lovely blouse and rips it wide
open 77

77 Annabelle, shocked, cries out, opens her eyes, her
hands trying to cover her suddenly revealed body 77

77 but too late.

Over her slip she is wearing the most Rube Goldberg7like
thing you ever saw. (It was called the Kepplinger Hold7
out and was a series of pulleys and cords that hid a
remarkable number of cards. The thing worked, believe it
or not, by using the knees, and is generally thought of
as being the greatest card7cheating device of the past
century.)

ANNABELLE
(embarrassed)
I didn't wear it 'til the
break 77
MAVERICK

77 and you didn't have to. Here's
my gift to you: the truth. You
were one of the six best players
out there.

(pulling the

holdout off her)
Get rid of this.

ANNABELLE
(confused, embarrassed,
touched)
Would you believe me if I told
you it didn't work? Look 77 all

the cards are still there 77
Contraption just jammed on me, I
couldn't get it to function.
(now, as her arms
go around Maverick)
Let's hope I have better luck
with you.

As suddenly, on its own, it starts working. An ace of
spades rises, BLOCKING OUR VIEW. HOLD ON the card, then 77

EXT. RIVERSIDE 7 FIREWOOD STOP 7 DAY 152
There are several carriages and various horses waiting.

Maverick and Annabelle, are by a waiting carriage. This
is good7bye and neither of them is all that happy.

MAVERICK
Where you headed?

ANNABELLE
(a shrug 77 she
doesn't know)
Someplace else.

MAVERICK
I'm going there too. Want to
travel together? I could use the

protection.
ANNABELLE
Long pause. Then 77
ANNABELLE
No. It would be wonderful, we

could fight all the time. But I

TWO OF THEM

A final embrace. Meaningful. They kiss. She gets into
the carriage and Maverick closes the door. The Driver
gets on his seat.

MAVERICK
Annabelle?

She turns back. He hands her a wallet he's just taken
from her purse.

ANNABELLE
(impressed)
That was good. You're getting
better.

Now she hands him his watch she's taken.

CUT TO:
EXT. CAMPFIRE 7 NIGHT 153

The half million in cash. Separated into two piles. The
satchel is alongside.

PULL BACK to reveal:
Coop, nervously waiting alone in a rocky place on the

edge of nowhere. A small fire is the only illumination.
A stream flows by.

Now, the sound of a WALKING SLOWLY. The sound STOPS. *
Coop draws his GUN, COCKS it 77 it makes a distinct

sound 77

77 KUH 77 LICK 77

77 he stares out into the darkness, ready for anything.
Then he relaxes, puts the gun back into its holster.

COOP
Where the hell you been?

PULL BACK to reveal:
The Coomodore. He moves to the fire.

THE COMMODORE

I had to say good7bye. I couldn't *
risk looking like I was rushing

any place. I took a lot of twists *
and turns, backtracking a lot. *
Made sure nobody was following me. *

You don't seem happy to see me.

COOP
(angry)
I thought you and me were in this
thing together 77 you win, I do
nothing. Someone else wins, I do
what I did. Why didn't you tell me *
Angel was in it too?

THE COMMODORE

What did Maverick say to that

sweet young thing? 'You never want
to give everything away.' If
Angel'd won, we'd still have split
it the same way. I telegraphed him
77 keep Maverick from the game. He
messed that up. Poor dead bastard.

COOP
I just don't like secrets.

THE COMMODORE
Then you probably won't like this
one either.

THE COMMODORE

as suddenly he draws his gun, cocks it 77
77 there's that sound again 77

77 KUH 77 LICK 77

77 and the GUN is aimed at Coop's heart.

THE COMMODORE
I guess it's just my greedy nature.
But I've decided not to share it
with you 77

COOP
(shocked)
A deal's a deal.

THE COMMODORE

In a perfect world, that's true.

(throws Coop's gun

in the water, ready

to fire)
I just want you to know I've
never worked with a more honest
man in my life.

Now 77 A familiar sound:
77 KUH 77 LICK 77
MAVERICK
I wouldn't give odds on it being
a long one. Uncock it.

They raise their hands as he gestures for them to sit

And we've

MAVERICK
Sit down, gentlemen. Let's get
cozy. Have a parley. Put your
hands down. You look ridiculous.
I almost fell asleep with boredom
following you 77 you and that
idiot speech about my wisdom 77
how could you expect me to fall
for that? You must think I'm
awful damn dumb.

(to Coop)
But you... you fooled me. And
not many can. But you saved me,
so I won't kill you.

(beat)
Just remember, the whole world
knows what you are. That's

punishment enough. All your
life's work, all the good you
did, you wiped it away. You don't
have anything to show for it.

COOP
You're young, so you don't know
that much about mistakes, but
you're making one now.

MAVERICK
Am I?

COOP
You can't leave me alive.

COOP

MAVERICK
You couldn't sneak up on a corpse,
Coop; not anymore. You're just

another decrepit old haS7been.
THE COMMODORE
scared, as Maverick studies his pistol.

THE COMMODORE
What're you gonna do?

MAVERICK
It's a problem 77 if I don't kill
you, what do I do?
COOP
watching, the fury still there.
MAVERICK

a shrug.

MAVERICK
What the heck!

MAVERICK

His hands fiddle a little with the gun, we can't really
see what he's doing. Then he points the gun at the
Commodore, as if to shoot him, then, at the last minute
he flicks the GUN to the side and SHOOTS. The bullet
just misses the Commodore and scares him very badly.

MAVERICK
Maybe the fairest thing would be
to just let one of you kill the
other 77 I'll let you decide which...

smiles with a deadly smile.

Well, that 77 as they say, is that!

And the Commodore pulls the trigger.

nothing.

CLICK, CLICK, CLICK!!!

There are no bullets in the gun!

Now obviously outclassed, the Commodore knows that he
is a dead man. Panic starts.

THE COMMODORE
That Maverick... son of a bitch...

Coop stand up and knocks the gun out of the Commodore's
hand. He punches him in the stomach and knocks his hat
off.

Coop punches him in the face and the Commodore is knocked
over a log. The Commodore tries to get up over the log.
