- RABBIT ANGSTROK

John Updike, 'Rabitt, Run'

1.

Run it under a harsh green fluorescent light-

CLOSE ON AN ANGRY BLDHDE PUNK, his head flying in and out of
frame. Hard against SOME GIRL's face. Banging against a
dirty mirror- Sweating. Meaning.

GIRL
Jim Jim Jimy Jimmy Jimmy oh god
Fuck me Rabbit Rabbit yes oh yes
Jimmy Rabbit Fuck Fuck Fuck

He's fucking her on top of a nasty sink. Fast. and furious.
Her short skirt hiked up high around her waist-

A wool cap pulled down tight over his face. This is Jim,
James, B, Bunny, Rabbit, B-Rabhit & Jimmy'Smith Jr.

To us he's just plain JIMMY.

GIRL
0h Rabbit fuck yes oh yes

They‘re in a desolate bathroom. Het. Full of noise.
Beats thumping through the walls. Fists banging on the door.
The girl moan-moaning. It's all so fucking loud.

CLOSE 0N JIMMY, catching sight of himself bouncing up a down
in the mirror. Ignoring the girl, he's somewhere else.
Gone. Always moving. We hear her coming. Jimmy stops.
stares. The harsh light crowns his head a burning halo

He doesn't look so good cold sweat.

JIMMY
— I gotta run.

She jumps off the sink, yanks down her skirt.

GIRL
(pissed)
Why? You still nervous? You're
lucky I ran into you 'cause I'm
tgxin' to help calm you down. But
it's like you ain't even fuckin'
here -

JIMMY
(pulls up his pants;
distraCted)
- what? Wasn't it good for you?

GIRL
Yeah. You know I love the way you
fuck_me, Rabbit. Why do you always
gotta ask?

Before Jimmy can answer a queer look crosses his face--
He rushes for a dirty stall and
we hear him puking his fucking brains out.

2. '.

Jiﬂnwu leaving the bathroom- Still a little green.

No sign of the girl. A line of guys waiting outside.

They scream, shout- Jimmy just laughs and gives 'em all the
finger. Heads down the corridor alone into the darkness.

3. .
An underground hip—hop club, THE SHELTER. A basement cave.
You can see the noise and the heat. Hall-to-wall kids. all
that sex- Hashing to the beat. Mostly black. Some white.
Whatever. Jimmy wipes his mouth, slips on headphones,
getting back into character. We hear his music, the song
being pumped into his head. Angry- Defiant- Beautiful.

He makes his way through rue Crowd, a hip-hop gladiator.
Walking tall. All attitude. Everybody around him dancing to
a different beat. We're sampling Tony Manero strutting down
the block from the opening of 'SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER.‘

Jimmy (Tony) checks out the girls, smiles their way. heading
backstage. But this ain‘t no fucking disco.

Before he gets far some BIG BAD DUDE stops him——

Shines a flashlight in his face. Hollas some shit at him.
Jimmy tears off his headphones. The song cuts out—A

JIMMY
{yells over the music!
— Yo what the fuck you call me?

BIG BAD DUDE
Where ya goin', dawg — you ain't
backstage, are ya?

JIMMY
What you say about me?
{gets right up in the
big man's face)
Do you even know who I am?

The big dude shines the light bright hack in Jimmy‘s face.
He‘s security.

BIG BAD DUDE
Fuck no. You wanna go backstage or
what?

JIMMY
I ain't goin' nowhere 'til you tell
me what the fuck you said. man —

Before the big guy can respond, a skinny black superstar
pulls Jimmy away. It's THE FUTURE aka Future, Fuchs E David
Porter. Also in his 205. the Future's all good.

FUTURE '.
(to the Big Bad Dude)
It's all good, hrotha. He's with
m—

Future drags Jinuy past the big guy backstage. Laughing at
him with love.

FUTURE
— You crazy mnthafucka. Why din't
ya just tell 'im you backstage for
the battle, Jimmy?

JIMMY
He said some shit -
(pulls away from
Future; spots
something on his
Shirt}
Fuck.

4.

Outside the club. Downtown Detroit. Bleak winter night.
Cold as hell. A mess of kids waiting to get in. Jimmy
hustles up some stairs, Future right on his tail.

FUTURE
Where ya runnin' to?

JIMMY
- I fuckin' poked on my shirt.

FUTURE
(laughs)
First time's always crazy -
youknowhatImsayin'? Didn't fucking
Mary calm you down?

A needy white guy in his late 205 with a big head, 'CHEDDER'
BOB ZUROWSKY aka Head, standing near the top of the line sees
Jimmy & Future heading in the opposite direction. He's slow.

CHEDDER BOB
Hey Rabbit - where ya--?

Jimmy turns, gestures Ione—minute—I'11—be—right—hack' and
keeps walking away- Future laughs, follows.

Cheddar Bob grabs two black guys huddled against the wall
smokin' dope; a short rolywpoly freak in his early 205 named
SOL GEORGE aka Mists Kingpin E Hista and his laid-hack older
brother. DJ 12 aka Israel George, Izzy E 12, a pseudo-
intellectual with dreads and glasses.

They're Jinny a Future's crew, R0486 ['Real Unforgiven For
Killin" — also the abortion pill).

CHEDDER BOB
C'mon. Rabbit an' Future're goin'
without us -

5.

Jimmy & Future head into a dark alley next to the club.
The crew follows. we can still hear the music booming
through the walls. A lone spotlight pierces the gloom.
Jimmy stops at a dumpster near the back.

SOL
- T'night's the night, boy. You on
your way up, yo. Next stop — Deal.

DJ 13
(goes to hug Jimmy]
No doubt no doubt — S'up, brotha?

JIMMY

(pulls back)
Puked on my shirt.

Cheddar Bob tries to get a closer look at Jimmy's T-shirt.

CHEDDER BOB
Lemme see -

JIMMY

(pushes him away)
Fuck off, Cheddar Bob -

Jimmy scrapes the dumpster away from the wall. Grabs a trash
bag hidden behind it.

SOL
(laughs)
Now listen, Bunny _ if you battle
that muthafucka Papa Doc, nigga was
talkin' some serious shit, yo -

Jimmy opens the trash bag. starts rooting around inside.
All the guys stop and stare.

JIMMY
{pulls out some clean
clothes from the bag}
Puckin' Janeane an' I jus‘ broke up
an' shit, an‘ she took the house an'
the goddamn car —

FUTURE
- Again?

DJ IZ
Maybe it's 'cause you keep fuckin'
all those other girls for a minute -

SOL
Yeah, Rabbit ~

CHEDDER BOB _
No you just need to forget that-
Janeane hitch, Rabbit. Just think
about all the fine bitches you gonna
get t'night after you win -

JIMMY
[looking through
the garbage bag}
She says she's pregnant, whatever,
YO '

A long beat.

FUTURE

- Now that's the heaviest influence
in that movie right there, man.

CHEDDER BOB
I bet that bitch is lyin', Rabbit.

SOL
(to Cheddar Bob}
Lemme ask ygg a question, bitch ~
I bet you probly never even bust in
a bitch befoe. Have you?

CHEDDER BOB
{turns red; to Jimmy)
You gonna stay at your mom's?

JIMMY
— fuck, Bob.
(pulls out a clean
T-shirt from the bag)
Yo can I please get some privacy
here, Elease -

The three guys acquiesce, walk toward the lit mouth of the
alley. The Future stays.

JIMMY
{laughs}

- my lucky shirt.
(more)

They meet up with the rest of the crew.
out, jumping, laughing, barking, 'B‘RABBIT!

JIMMY {bont'd)

[peels off the dirty

shirt; shivering in

the cold)
It's my birthday in a couple weeks,
Puche --An' it's like, I gotta do
somethin', ya know? Somethin' real.

(puts on the clean T}
- I mean all I ever wanted to do was
rap, YO - be an emcee. But I know
they ain't gonna like me in there -

FUTURE
If you rap. you rap muthafucka. It
don't matter. You just gotta stop
givin' a fuck what other people

Jimmy hides the garbage bag back behind the dumpster.

JIMMY

- People can't talk shit about me
like that, yo.

FUTURE
Just wreck those mics an' gain some
respect, youhearwhatlmsayin'?

JIMMY
It's like do or die time for me now,
Fuche.
FUTURE
{laughs}

They both head back up the alley toward their friends and the

JIMMY

And they all shout

up on stage in the club.
Two emcees squaring off.

One-on-one. Two 60 second scoreboard clocks tick down...
It's Fight Music. And right now one very short brother named
LIL' TIC (Little Lunatic) is battling Jimmy- Up in his face.

He's spittin' about--
1. Jimmy's name ~ B—Rabhit-

2. Jimmy's skin color — white.
3. Jimmy's inexperience — 1st battle.

Jimmy just stands there, his wool cap pulled down tight.

Bouncing a little to the beat.

Shaking out the nerves.

People start booing him right away.

SLAM TO:

MAIN TITLE:

fight
music

He still hear the scratching which leads us into our title
song, the song we first heard playing in Jimmy's headphones...

7.

Poor Detroit. Jimmy runs through the diseased streets of his
life past all the crack whores and dead ends. Holding onto
his garbage bag full of clothes, headphones back on his head.
His breath visible in the night air. He and it the only
white around. We still hear our title song.

Jimmy runs. Runs through a busy intersection, right on by
the entrance of a ratty trailer park, running down a side
street. Running up to a big vacant field down at the end.
Urban blight. Dying grass. A graveyard for shopping carts,
broken appliances, used needles & other shit.

Jimmy stops.
And screams out at the top of his lungs.
Loud and long.

Then he runs to a chain link fence at the edge of the field,
looks both ways making sure no one sees him, and hops over it.

8.

Jimmy makes his way through the maze of trailers. Up to a
drab double—wide mobile home. A beatvto—shit big—ass '79
.Lincoln abandoned in front. Down. And out.

9- .

Jimmy lets himself in. Drops the garbage bag. He's cold,
blowing on his hands trying to warm himself up. The place is
a dump. All white trash.

The title song still blaring in his headphones and on our
soundtrack.

JIMMY
Mom?

7 He heads for his mom‘s bedroom. As he gets closer, we hear
some noise. 'Moans. And grunts. A breathless scream.

we hear sex. Raw. And loud.

Not Jimmy. All he hears is music.

JIMMY
Mom?

He slides open the flimsy vinyl bedroom door and sees his mom
fucking some guy! On top. Riding away~~
Jﬂnny pulls off his headphones. The title song ends.

JIMMY
(in shock)
Nomi?!
STEPHANIE
Rabbit?

10.

Later. Jimmy's eating cereal in the lousy kitchen. dry no
milk. A small TV, beer bottles E comic books litter the
countertops. A rusty electric space heater vibrates heat.
It's almost quiet for the first time in the movie.

His mother, STEPHANIE, slinks in wearing an oversized
”Osborne Higb' sweatshirt and little else. Her hair's a sex
mess, she slurs her words a little maybe a little drunk.
she's a young 40. small a sexy in that bleached blonds
trailer trash sorta way.

STEPHANIE
You okay. baby - Wan'me ta make ya
somethin'?
(ruffles his hair)
— Dontchya think maybe ya shoulda
knocked or neybe called first or
somethin'?

JIMMY
Yo — the phone's disconnected.

STEPHANIE
(defensive)
Yeah I know. Rabbit. I know, I jus‘
gotta run down to the — um - the
phone place tomorrow -

10.

JIH‘HY '-
Imouth full of dry
cereal}
- An' there's no milk. Ever.
STEPHANIE
Hex - I been busy, ya know.
JIMMY
Still goin' to bingo or get a job

yet?

A thick lame white dude. GREG MINOR, stumbles into the
kitchen on one good leg like he owns the place. Just a few
YPKIS 01561 than Jimmy, all Grrg's got on is a two-day beard,
pair of 'Osborne High" sweatnants, and a shit~eatin‘ grin.

GREG
{slaps Jimmy on the
back of his head)
Rabbit - what the fuck you doin'
here? How 'bout knockin'?

Jimmy doesn't react. Too tired to fight. It's clear that
Greg makes him uncomfortable. Makes him feel like he's back
in high school. Jimmy seems to shrink when he‘s around.

JIMMY
(turns to his mom)
Janeane an' I broke up —

STEPHANIE
None of those girls are right for
you, baby. She say she's pregnant?

Jimmy nods.

STEPHANIE
Right. I bet she took the car too ~

JIMMY
(doesn't want to talk
about it; gets up)
- I gotta work in the mornin'.

STEPHANIE
- You and Future still at that
Little Caesars in warren?

She lights a cigarette. Greg takes it from her, smokes.

JIMMY
No I — ahh — I--

11.

GREG .
C'mon. man, you got fired from
Little Caesars? Nobody gets fired
from Little Caesars —

JIMMY
L yo I'm too tired for this shit.

STEPHANIE
You stayin' here, baby?

JIMMY
- just for a few weeks 'til I save
enough to get my own place.

GREG
Just like Bob Zurowsky. All your
friends still livin' at home —
aren‘t they, Rabbit?
{laughs}
Guys're a bunch a fucking losers -

Without skipping a beat Jimmy grabs a beer bottle & fires it
at Greg's head! It just misses, smashing against the wallr—
Greg bolts up, cigarette still stuck in his mouth——

Jimmy instinctively takes a step back.

violence about to break.

Stephanie jumps in the middle--

STEPHANIE
(screams at Jimmy)
YOU STOP IT! JAMES SMITH JUNIOR!
STOPIT NOW!

Just then a sleepy little angel appears in the doorway of the
kitchen, six-year-old LILY, Jimmy's little half-sister.
She lights up when she sees Jimmy. Runs to him.

He gives her a big hug. Violence broken- Greg laughs, gets
himself a cold beer from the ‘fridge instead.

JIMMY
Yo - shouldn't you be sleepin', Lily?

LILY
You woke HF up ya know.
(whispers to him)
- will you sing to me?

JIMMY
C'mon — back to bed. It's late.

12.

11. .

Jmnmy carries Lily into her little girl bedroom. Neat. clean.
A mountain of stuffed animals on her bed. As he puts her
down, we hear him quietly sweetly lovingly rapping to her.
And he's good. Real good.

Suddenly they hear Stephanie shout out from the kitchen--

STEPHANIE (05)
Rabbit Ya Better Clean Alltbisshit
Upinhere Or I'll KickYouout For Good!

Jiumy & Lily look at each other, share a laugh.

12.

Later. Jimmy's picking up the broken beer bottle in the tiny
kitchen. Stephanie stands in the doorway watching.

STEPHANIE
- Rabbit. if you're gonna stay here
you better get along or-r

JIMMY
What'd I do? Yo he started this shit -

STEPHANIE
- don't fuck this up for me, baby.
You're not in high school anymore,
okay?

Rabbit pushes the last bits of broken glass against the wall
with his foot. It‘s been a long night.

JIMMY
(sarcastic)
Forget it, whatever. I love Greg.
Can I get a ride to work in the
mornin'?

Stephanie goes over to the kitchen table, grabs her car keys
and tosses them to Jimmy.

JIMMY
— you're lettin' me take the car?

STEPHANIE
Nope- I'm givin' it to ya «
It's your birthday present.

JIMMY
- thanks. My birthday‘s not for two
weeks. yo - -

13.

STEPHANIE
(laughs; almost
flirtatious)
You're still my lil' Rabbit, right?

13.

The next morning, cold E clear outside the trailer. Jimmy.

trying to start the big~ass '79 Lincoln. Click. Nothing.
Click. Click. It's dead.

JIMMY

(jumps out, checks
hi? watch)
Shiiit —

He's late. Jimmy pops the hood, looks underneath.

Just then a chubby charismatic white hipster named WINK
EPSTEIN aka 3rd Person, ambles up. Early 205, soul patch,
and the harmonies of hip—hop verbalization.

WINK
Yo Bunny you back home -

JIMMY

— ain't my home, Wink. How the fuck
you know I was here?

WINK
{smiles}
Please. Who ya'think you talkin' to?

JIMMY

(slams down the hood)
Don‘t tell nobody. okay?

[checks his watch;

dirty hands)
Yo I gotta run — gimme a ride to
work? I'm gonna be fuckin' late —

WINK
My mom's got the car -
[kicks the Lincoln)

Yo you should just blow this shit
up, E-

11.

Jimmy hops the fence at the edge of the dirty trailer park.
Wink hot on his heels.

RINK
- Why we goin' this way?

14.

JIMMY
(just gives him a
look)
Yo where were you last night?

They head through the vacant field together.

WINK
I heard ya got caught out. People
sayin' some fucked up shit, boy.

Jimmy stops before he hits the street. wipes his dirty hands
on his pants, wanting to run away from Wink and last night
and the trailer park and everything else in his fucking life.

JIMMY
- like what?

He checks up a down the busy intersection making sure no one
sees him1 and hustles away from the trailer park.
wink follows.

WINK
You just gotta bounce wit' wink, B.
You the franchise. baby. They just
jealous. like Janeane -

Jim
You talked to 'er?

WINK
Forget it. An' fuck hattlin' down

JIMMY

WINK
Stay home, Bunny. You ain't goin'

JIMMY

WINK

(laughs; pounds his
chest}
Wink's all 3rd Person now. 'Bout to

They make it to the bus stop. a few people waiting.

15.

JIM .
- how we gonna do that? I'm takin'
the fuckin' bus to work, man.

Jimmy anxiously looks down the street for his bus.

wink puts his arm around Jimmy‘s shoulder, bringing him in
close.

WINK
Don't tell no one, but I jus'
recorded a demo up at Paisley Park.

JIMMY
- Paisley Park?

VII-LT
With Prince- The Artist. 3rd
Person? Prince gave me that name.

JIMMY
You're full a shit. yo — How the
fuck you know Prince?

Wink pulls out an envelope from his pocket.

WINK
— He's friends with Lee Darucher,
man. Serious. I just recorded at
Paisley Park. yo.

Wink opens the envelope, shows Jimmy some photographs.
CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS 0F WINK 5 PRINCE, hanging out in a giant

studio control room. The massive console all lit up with
bright bright lights.

JIMMY

Jimmy on the bus, looking out the window. Poverty. Hard
times E pain. Be slips on his headphones, pulls out a pen
and starts writing on his dirty hand.

CLOSE 0N JIHHY'S HAND. letters.

Words.

Rhymes.

CLOSE ON JIMHY'S FACE, closing his eyes.

And we hear the opening lines to the song. a cappella-
and then a beat kicks in. the bass line, and a groove.
And as the words a music come together in a song,
Jimmy's set free. He opens his eyes-..

rho bus, the poor, Detroit, it's all LRIKIIZD. By R. Crumb-
hnd Jimmy, he's a Superman. Costume, muscles, the whole deal.
SUPHIJIHIY- He's rapping the song for all to hear- Jumps up

Rscaping his earthly bonds a dull reality.

has: NIGHT. SnperJimmy flies onstage in the Shelter, grabs
the mic from LIL' TIC with one hand a with the other squeezes
Tic's animated head right off. Blood gushing everywhere as
SuperJimmy just treestyler cool to the crowd-

The rhymes and the blood flowing fast. The audience applauds
screaming — going crary — loving all of SuperJinny and his

music- He tinishes & waves goodbye, flying off BACK INTO THE
FUTURE, heading for the suburbs and the nice part of town...

TODLI- The nice part of town. SuperJimmy flies over a five—
star hotel. Up-scale, grand. Still singing his song-

Ee darts down toward the hack of the hotel and head: through
a big open window. flying into a locker room in the basement.

He dives at a locker changing super East out of his costume.
1nd into his uniform---
Shirt. Tie. Vest.

Becoming JIMMY THE BELLHAN. BACK TO REALITY (film).
He takes off his headphones, glancing at his reflection in a
locker room mirror. the song cutting out-—

16-
Jimmy hurries up to the front of the fancy hotel lobby, his
tie‘s a mess, collar askew. He's late.

17.

Slides into position next to his friend Cheddar Bob. and a
thin black bellman in his early 305 named PAUL, who's

greeting guests at the door. Classical muSic plays in the
background.

PAUL

{to Jinngq
Mr. Springer wants to see you in his
office. James -

CHEDDER BOB
{to Paul)
Fuck you. homo -
{straightens out

Jimmy's tie & collar}
You okay?

JIMMY
Are you drunk?

CHEDDER BOB
(he is)

Shhhhhh. You okay about last night?

JIMMY
Fuck last night, bitch —

17.

CLOSE ON JIMMY, taking Shit.

Pissed off.
Beat.

HR. SPRINGER (05}

- is that why you were late again,
Mr. Smith? Hell?

Jimmy doesn't say anything just looks down at his hands...
They're still smudged dirty, lyrics scrawled all over them

like strange tattoos. He shifts in his seat and hides his
hands under his legs.

MR. SPRINGER {08)
What do you have to say for
yourself, Mr. Smith?

Jimmy and his boss, MR. SPRINGER, a dark-skinned white man in
his late 405 with a mustache, are sitting right across from

each other in a cramped basement office. The door behind
Hr. Springer's desk isn't closed all the way-

JIMMY
— You can call me Jimmy.

18.

HR. SPRINGER
Okay. gm. You know we were
hesitant to take you on in the first
place, Jimmy; because you're friends
with NI. Zurowsky. But,—— Are you
sure you can cut it here. Ginny?

Before Jimmy can answer that bullshit question the phone
rings. Hr. Springer snaps it up.

MR. SPRINGER (into the phone)
Rooms division —
{some air goes out of
him; whipped)
— Yes. hon, I'll be hrue at seven...
Yes...Yes, of course I will...Yes?

As Mr. Springer continues to tolerate his wife, Jimmy notices
a girl sitting down outside the office- He shifts in his
seat trying to get a better look through the door.

And catches sight of a HONEY—DIPPED GIRL, maybe 18 or so, so
sexy and indifferent she‘s obscene, impossible. Short hair.
Long legs. Oh God...

Mr. Springer hangs up the phone. all business.
Jimmy can't keep his eyes off of the girl, the girl.

HR. SPRINGER
Okay, Mr. Smith. I have another
meeting now so ~ If you're late
again we're gonna have to let you
go. You have to do better,-— I know
you can be a better bellman -

Jimmy snaps out of it- Gets up. shoves his dirty hands in
his pockets and heads out. Time to eat more shit.

JIMMY
Yes, sir. I will —

When he gets to the door he turns back to Mr. Springer.
The girl's now standing right behind him in the doorway.

JIMMY
I guess it's not the right time to
ask for extra shifts, Mr. Springer.
Is it? But I - ahh - really need the
money.

MR. SPRINGER
— I'm sure you do, but let's just
see how this week works out first,

Jimmy. okay?
(more)

19.

HR. SPRINGER {Cont'd}
(motions the girl in]
Miss?

Jimmy leaves humiliated, still managing to smile at the girl
as she enters the office. Heading out, he turns back around
pulling his dirty hands from of his pockets & throws up a
middle finger in the direction of Mr. Springer's office--

The Honey-Dipped Girl looks up as she closes the door, sees
Jimmy flipping her off. And gives him the finger right back!

18.

Dusk. Darkness falling visible on the ratty trailer park.
Jimmy's working under the hood of the Lincoln. The Future's
kickin' back in the front seat. They hear LYNYRD SKYNYRD's
'Sweet Home Alabama' drift out of the mobile home.

JIMMY
- yo you shoulda seen this girl,
Future. She was,-- I mean. Shit.

She's perfect, yo.

FUTURE
Perfect? Perfect got a name?

Jimmy shrugs, puts up the hood on his hooded sweatshirt.
It's getting cold. They hear Greg inside the trailer start
singing along with Lynyrd Skynyrd.

FUTURE
- Who the fuck is that?

JIMMY
That dude Greg Miner‘s practically
livin' with my mom, yo. Met at
Bingo up in Windsor. Neither of 'em
ever fucking win — '

FUTURE
- we went to school with 'im. right?

JIMMY
He was a senior with Cheddar Bob,
man. I got'- save some money an'
get the fuck outta here, yo -

They listen to Greg sing; he's terrible- Hear him turn up
the stereo inside. And Future starts singing along at the
top of his lungs, off-key. making up the words as he goes...
Then he begins to freestyle over the rock a roll beat.
Jimmy takes a turn. Rapping over 'Sweet Home Alabama."
They go back a forth spittin' out verses over the music.

20.

FUTURE -
- Yo there's another battle next
week, Jimmy. Winner's takin' my
plaCe as host. I'm signin' you up -

JIMMY

(goes back to work
under the hood)
Try it now -

Future tries to turn the car over. Click. Click.
Jimmy keeps working on the car.

Shit.
FUTURE

You gotta let those people know you

Ya know they say. that man, 'Ill,

JIMMY

FUTURE
{busts out laughing}
Wink says he knows Prince? What the
fuck does Prince gotta do with our
music, Jimmy? Wink's jus' talk.
There will be no action. only talking.

JIMMY

- No. he had pictures. yo. This
could be a qul opportunity for me —

Greg limps out of the trailer singing 'Sweet Home Alabama" to
himself, sees Jimmy and Future working on the car.

They throw him a look. He just laughs and heads back inside
singing his ass off.-

FUTURE
- yo, that dude mentally ill?

21.

JIMMY
Car accident, man. S'pposed to get
some big settlement soon —

FUTURE

himself now?

JIMMY

{motions to the car)
Try it again —

FUTURE
3rd Person? Shit. I don't wanna
bring too much negativity towards my
positive, but he is not a good
rapper. That muthafucka's weak.
I'd rather listen to funky 01' Greg
sing —

Future tries to start the car. It groans. Sputters. Spits.
And starts. Jimmy smiles, he fixed it. The Future's up.

FUTURE
Yo son, we goin' out t'night!

JIMMY
(slams down the hood}

19.

Night. The whole gang's riding in the big—ass '79 Lincoln.
Jimmy and Future up front. hip-hop thumping from the car's
shitty radio, tinny speakers tuned to 96.3. Sol, DJ 12 and
Cheddar Bob in the back seat gettin' high-

DJ 12
Yo boy, this is your mom's birthday

Chedder Bob pulls out a bottle of vodka from inside his coat.

FUTURE
- Stealin' from your mom again, Head?

CHEDDER BOB
She don't notice, she's too lit up
most a the time. Where's Wink?

He takes a drink and passes the bottle to Sol who hands him
the joint.

SOL

CHEDDER BOB

“Put our money into savings bonds — '
(in his own voice)
Just shutthefuckup. I'm tired of

JIMMY

CHEDDER BOB
— I heard she got VD.

SOL
So what, nigga — I'd still fuck-—

Before Sol can finish the car goes black. Cuts off.

The radio. The lights. The steering wheel. The brakes.
Everything. dead. All the power's gone.

Jimmy tries to maintain control of the car.

The guys are screaming.

The '79 Lincoln gently coasts to the side of the road.

20.

Later. Dark side of the road. Silhouetted against the sky,
the guys stand around the car like hunters examining kill.

FUTURE
That was crazy -

Jimmy hops in, starts up the car. Lights.

24.

The car running.

JIHHY
- Jus' must he a short in the

electrical system, yo, whatever.
Let's go —

SOL
Uh—uh. I'm not gettin' back in that
piece a shit -

DJ 12
[quiet so Jimmy can't
hear)
- it's a fuckin' deathtrap. I think
his mom must be tryin' to kill ’im.

CHEDDER BOB
(laughs; whispers)
You think Rabbit's mom's tryin' to
kill 'im?

Jimmy's ears are so good he hears everything. He jumps back
out of the car-—

JIMMY
What you say?

CHEDDER BOB
Nothin‘, Rabbit -

JIMMY
I hear everythin'r yo — my mom ain't
tryin' to kill mg. Fuckin' kill

CHEDDER BOB
- Hey I don't wanna die. Rabbit.
(thinks about it}
I mean, I dunno what the fuck I'm
livin' for, but I really don't wanna
die-

21.

They pull into the crowded parking lot of a seedy Chinese
restaurant. STANLEY'S CAFE. Red neon. Kids hanging out
talking groping and getting high. Noise and hip—hop fill the
air. Jimmy gets out of the car first, keeps moving.

The other four slip out with attitude and head for the
restaurant.

Jimmy leads the way. Future right behind him, a few steps in
front at Sol & DJ 12. Chedder Bob pulling up the rear.

2S.

CLOSE ON JIMMY. looking around the parking lot. Outside
himself.
Stops.

His friends catch up to him.

FUTURE
You okay, Jhm?

SOL
Yeah c'mon, B. Where ya goin' -

They all keep moving. Jimmy stays there for a minute.
Throws up his sweatshirt hood, hiding.
And finally follows after them-

They pass by a group of kids hanging out under a Streetlight
at the edge of the parking lot. Kids spittin' out verses.
Kickin' some rhymes. In a circle. This is a cipha.

It's not competitive, just people checking each other out.
Free- And easy.

RU486 joins in, Future leading the way.
Jimmy still trailing behind.

FUTURE
RU486 is here, my people —
Let us show you the way -

SOL
Gonna kick some serious shit -

FUTURE
Yeah, Mista.

Jimmy looks out from under his hood- Checks the crowd.
Future joins in the cipha, spits some alien shit.

He is a motherfucking star. Finishes.

How Sol's up (Mista Kingpin}. A freak.

A bigger crowd gathers- Bouncing.
We see Wink hustle up, smiling and handing out Elyers.

Future pulls off Jimmy's hood, pushes him forward. His turn.
CUDSE 0N JIMMY, starting out slowly, unsure, hesitant.
Working into it. Faster. Quicker. Forgetting the crowd.
The words flow setting him free...

Easily the best. The Future laughs. he knows.

While Jimmy's rapping, we see the Honey’Dipped Girl from work
join the crowd. She's with a group of'hip young kids.
They all listen to Jimmy. He doesn't see her.

Jimmy finishes.
DJ Iz steps up 5 smooths out some rhymes-

26.

Jimmy spots two guys heading in his direction; a solid black
dude with a baseball cap pulled down tight over his face
named PAPA DOC, aka Papa, and his sidekick LC LYCKETY—SPLYT
aka LC 5 Lyckety~Splyt, a very skinny black clown. They‘re
both part of RUeBG's rival crew, LEADAZ 0? TBA FREE WORLD,
aka the Free World. Aka the enemy-

Jimmy looks for someplace to run.

LC Lyckety—Splyt jumps onto the hood of a car near the middle
of the cipha--

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
(hyping; screaming)
LISTEN UP NOW — LEADAZ OF THE FREE
WORLD IN THE MUTHATU *ﬁ' HOUSE an'
Shit! ME AN‘ PAPA DOC - WE‘LL
BATTLE m mmwcms HERE —

Papa Doc steps up on the car with Lyckety~5plyt.

They now have everybody‘s full attention. Cipha over.
Jimmy takes a step back into the crowd.

His friends all up in arms--

SOL
Yo, told y'all - Papa Doc an‘ LC

CHEDDER BOB

LC Lyckety—Splyt looking for someone to challenge. still
working the crowd over, eyes Jimmy and his crew.

LC LYCKETY—SPLYT

Yo all you muthafuckas are weak an'

(points to Soll
Mista Kingpin ~

(freestyles a few

rhymes about him;

' points to the Future)

The Fu--

Before LC can even say his name Future points right back at
him & yells out~-

. FUTURE
Shut Up Bitch -

Papa Doc takes a step toward the Future.

27-

PAPA not.
(menacing)
What the fuck you gonna do about it?

Jimmy stands up for his friend.

JIMMY
Yeah? C'mon motherfucker —

LC LYCRE'I'Y—SPLY‘I‘

(points to Jimmy)
Yo Rabbit ~ B—Rabbit - You don't
wanna battle me, white boy — You

at Shelter last night —

[opens his mouth E

nothing comes out -

& does it again,

then falls over on

the car, choking)
EMMA-HAWAII -

 

Some people in the crowd laugh. Humiliating Jimmy.
And he just fucking loses it, all that anger.

Jimmy yanks LC Lyckety»Splyt off the Car by his neck slamming
his head hard into the ground.

The violence real. Ugly. Loud. Past.

Starts kicking him in the face——

Papa Doc dives off the hood, tackling Jimmy to the ground-e
Jimmy shoves him away, gets up ready to fight.

Future, Sol and DJ Iz run up getting Jimmy's back——

Cheddar Bob trying to act all tough and shit just stands over
Lyckety-Splyt.

And Wink jumps right into the middle of it all--

Pushing Papa Doc away from the fight, staying in the middle.
Breaking it up. It's clear from the way Wink talks to Papa
Doc they know each other. They're friends.

WINK
- Yo what tha fuck, Papa? Please.
LC's full a shit, yo ~ Actin' up
like that -

LAPA DOC
-Stay outta this, Wink- It's none a
your fucking business -

WINK

Papa goes over to help up Lyckety—Splyt.
Future drags Jimmy away from the fight-

28.

JIHHY .

{insane with anger)
Fucking Hotherfuckers! I'll fucking

Sol. DJ 12 and Chedder Bob help to hold Jimmy back. trying to
calm him down.

SOL (OS)
— This gon be your only opportunity

Jimmy's standing next to 301 & Future, both sitting on one
side of a booth, a real PRETTY GIRL squeezed in hetWeen them.
Chedder Bob alone on the other side. Chinese take-out's

open. Restaurant's closed. Red booths line the mirrored
walls, tables cleared out for a DJ and a dance floor.

CHEDDER BOB

Jimmy looks up and sees the girl. the Honey—Dipped Girl, the

He can't believe it. She disappears into the crush.

Jimmy balls up the flyer and throws it away.

CHEDDER BOB

Jimmy turns around. Starts heading the other way.

JIMMY
- I Gotta Go.

WINK

Jimmy stops. Gives another quick look over the dance floor.

Jimmy throws up his hood keeping his head low. Hiding.

JIMMY

WINK
Yo Jimmy is it okay if some of us

Jﬂuny and his friends, the girl and one of her girlfriends,
all walk up to the big~ass '79 Lincoln. The windows all
steamed up.

DJ 12
C'mon. Let's go, I'm cold -

Just then a naked foot slides against the foggy rear window
smudging a View. A girl's ass flashes into frame, a head

bobbing up a down, hands grabbing.
A scream.

CHEDDER BOB
Are they killin' that bitch or what?

DJ 12 opens the back door. a pretty naked leg spills out.

DJ IZ
— She ain't dead yet.

DJ 12 jumps right in. More screams--

_SOL (05}
What the fuck, yo? Can't you knock

DJ 12 (08)

It's a car, nigga — An' it‘s

while Sol E DJ Iz argue, everybody starts piling into the car.
Jimmy and the Honey-Dipped girl suddenly find themselves
standing next to each other. Alone. Eyes meet.

Time for names. she's ALEXANDRA LATOURNO, Alex E Al, and she
shivers just a little bit in the cold.

JIMMY

Alex slides into the Lincoln. Before Jimmy gets in he hears
someone call out 'HEX Rabbit!‘ from across the parking lot.
It's Janeane.

He jumps into the car.

FUTURE
(laughs, shouts out
from the back seat)
Quick. It's the baby mama drama!

And Jimmy peels out before Janeane gets close——

26.

Fast car flying. Nine people packed inside tight. Future a
501 with their girl on their laps playing around in the back
seat next to DJ :2 E Cheddar Bob squeezed together. Up

sittingthisclosetoJimmy driving.

It's crazy, loud. 96.3 on the radio. Fighting, tickling,

Future grabs the girl and starts kissing her in the jam.
Sol pushes DJ 12.

Alex leaning even closer to Jimmy when she looks, her face
brushes against his, her hand on his shoulder, steadying.

Jimmy swerves the car

She falls against him, on him. Over him.

Suddenly he hears his mother scream out 'No!‘
Hears the front door slam shut!

29.

Jimmy runs out of the bathroom, towel wrapped around his
waist. His mother's holding onto a piece oi paper. Freaking
out. Lily's on the couch. The TV on.

JIMMY
what's the matter?

STEPHANIE
— I just got served. goddamnit.

He motions to Lily, leads his mom toward her bedroom.

JIMMY
— How many months late're you?

STEPLANIE

flimsy Vinyl door shut.

JIMMY

— Really? Prince?

JIMMY
Yeah. Maybe.

STEPHANIE
{still smiling; gives
him a big bug]
I knew you were a genius. We gonna
be rich. Rabbit!

30.

Jimmy the bellman, unloading luggage from a cart into a
suite. A hip guest in his early 3Ds named MR. LEONARD is
across the room talking on the phone like Jimmy isn't even
there.

MR. LEONARD [into the Phone)
- I didn‘t sleep with her. I'm in
lows with yon...0f course I think
you're beautiful...Hold on —
(puts his hand over
the phone; to Jimmy)
Hey busboy -

Jimmy stops, did the guy just call him 'busboy?‘
Jimmy holds his tongue, continues unloading the luggage cart.
Mr. Leonard snaps his fingers, motions him over-—

MR. LEONARD
Busboy —

JIMMY
Excuse me — my name is Jimmy, Mr.
Leonard. And I'm a bellman, not a
busboy —

MR. LEONARD
[doesn't give a shit)
Sorry — can you get me a pack a
Marlboros, man?

JIMMY
Sure. Mr. Leonard —

MR. LEONARD {into the phone]
— sorry, sweetie, I just gotta find
some money for the busboy...You sure
you're okay?

42.

Hr. Leonard turns his back on Jimmy, looking around the
nightstand for cigarette money.

Jimmy closes his eyes; we hear an angry Song thump on the
soundtrack. He opens up..-

The room is axrlnrrn. Superainay flies at In. hEOKLRD. Grabs
the phone out of his hand. Starts strangling his to death
Iith the chord, rapping out about calling hil s busboy.

Ir. Leonard turns cartoon blue. And dies. SuperJiumy just
picks him up a throws him out the window, still spitting.
Ir. Leonard crashes down to the ground.

Ann SuperJinny flies up up E away into the sky.

31.

sac: r0 REALITY {filo}. Jimmy, wheeling the cart back to the
front lobby. Pissed off. Runs into EARL, a quiet old
bellman in his 605, tired. Classical music in the background.

EARL
What‘s the matter?
JIMMY
Some fuckin' guest just called me a
busboy -
EARL
— Huh?
JIMMY

(raises his voice)
Some Sonuvahitch Called Me A Busboy,
A Eusboy, Earl. And now I'm gettin'
'im cigarettes -

(laughs, leans in

closer}
Lemme ask you, man, how you put up
with all this shit for like 30 yearS?

Just then, Mr. Springer walks by. Slows down.
Checking up on Jinny and Earl.

MR. SPRINGER
(already knows the
answer!
On time today, Hr. Smith?

JIMMY
Yessir —

Mr. Springer smiles, continues on his way.

43.

And Jimy flips him off behind his back-

EARL
(takes the cart from
Jhnny)
- sometimes it helps to be hard a
hearing, Jim.

JIMMY
Yeah —
EARL
(smiles)
Dr ya could just rip out their vocal
chords.

What? Earl walks off with the cart.
Jimmy watches him for a moment.
Shakes his head, gets moving.

He passes by the lobby lounge and sees Alex shadowing an
older woman, getting trained. Serving tea to wealthy old
ladies. mothers E daughters. It's formal afternoon tea. and
Alex is a 'tea girl' dressed in a short black skirt, black

hose. black shoes, and white blouse. Sexy in that French
maid way.

Alex looks up and sees Jimmy.

She smiles and discreetly gives him the finger. Flirting.
He laughs.

32.

Jimmy, heading into the hotel's gift shop.

He hears someone call out 'Rabbit!‘

Shit. It's Janeane.

Jimmy looks around. No place to run. No place to hide.
Janeane ﬁinally catches up to him.

JRNEEN'E
Why haven't you called?

JIHMY
Yo Janeane - shit, I can't talk
now - I'm wr king -
(to the salesperson)
Can I get a pack a Harlboros?

JnNEANE
— I don't care. I'm your
girlfriend, Rabbit.

44.

JIMMY -
(looks around; lowers
his voice)
Keep your voice down. Shit. I work
here. yo.

Jimmy pays for the cigarettes and heads out of the store.
Janeane follows after him.

JIMMY
- An' you're not my girlfriend
anymore. He broke up.

JRNEANE
But you took off this time without
even sayin' a word. We weren't even
fighting -

JIMMY
At least I left you the car an' shit.

JANEANE
Was it 'cause I said I was pregnant?

Jimmy heads down the hallway back toward the front lobby.

JIMMY
(getting pissed)
I can't talk now, Janeane — You
gotta get the fuck outta here —

m
I just wanna be your girlfriend,
Rabbit —

JIMMY
- you're gonna get me fired.

JRNEANE
(stops; starts to
lose it}
— Just tell me why you left,--
Hhat'd I do, What'd I do — tell me,
an' I'll leave you alone, Rabbit —

Jimmy pulls Janeane a ‘de. fast. Trying to calm her down.
He looks ower to the lounge to see if anybody's watching
them. Alex is Working- No one notices him & Janeane.

JIMMY
(keeping an eye on
_ Alex; talks East}
- you didn‘t do anything, Janeane.
It's my shit.
{more}

45.

JIMMY [cont'dJ
I just had to get out,-- I felt all
trapped an' shit ~ ya know the
dishes were pilin' up, you were
always outta cigarettes, an' the TV
was always goin‘ - and, and, and I
knew you weren't pregnant. you jus'

told me that shit to get me to stay.
but -

JANEANE
{pushes him away)
Fuck You, you ain't willin' to do

the work, Rabbit ~ what're you
runnin' from?

JIMMY
- Nothin'.

And Jimmy just walks away.

The classical music playing in
the background.

Janeane keeps up the fight, eyes red——

JANEANE
{calls after him}
Why do you always gotta run away?

He doesn't answer, keeps walking.

JANEANE
RABBIIIIT!

Everyone in the place looks over at Janeane. Jimmy turns red.

He hurries back, putting his arm around Janeane and quickly
leads her out toward the front door, desperately trying to
avoid any further embarrassment.

JIMMY
Janeane, you gotta go -

JANEANE
I'm your girlfriend, Rabbit — you
can‘t do this to me —

everybody's now watching them.

Jimmy hustles her outside. out into the cold.

Storm clouds loom overhead. It‘s gonna rain, maybe snow.

JIMMY
C'mon, baby, go home -

JENEANE

— Ya know evarybody's callin' you a
loser from the other night.

46.

JIMMY
Who told ya that?

JANEANE
(she grabs his arm;
holding on)
I heard ya got booed off stage at
the Shelter. Froze up. They're all
talkin‘ about it —

JIMMY
(yanks his arm away;
hard] .
Fuck you, Janeane. Go home.

Jimmy heads straight back inside.

Alex is waiting for him by the door, standing next to Paul,
the other bellman.

ALEX
Is everything, ya know, okay?
0' IMMY
{keeps walking; head
down)
Yeah -
[quiet so Paul can't
hear)
- Did everybody hear that shit or
what?
Alex looks at him.
ALEX

(hides a smile)
Yeah.

Jimmy just shakes his head, walks to the elevators.
Alex follows after him.

ALEX
Was that your girlfriend?
JIMMY
No —
Alex just laughs.
ALEX

—.Hey. can you gimme a ride home or
whatever after work?

47.

33. -

After work. Pouring rain. Dark, it's getting darker.
Jimmy's car is parked in an empty lot near the hotel.
He and Alex are inside the Lincoln. Out of uniform.

Jiunw'can't get the car started. Click. Click.
Dead.

He looks over at Alex. He's still fucked up from his fight
with Janeane. The windows fogging up. It's the first time
they're all alone- Silence. Tension. Are they gonna kiss?

Alex lights up a cigarette, inhales deeply.
Jimmy tries again. Click. Nothing.
Exhales.

JIMMY
- I think there's an umbrella in the
trunk, yo-

And we hear a more upbeat jazzy version of our opening title
song...

3!.

Jimmy & Alex walking in the rain, sharing an umbrella.
Heading for a crowded bus stop. Bright headlights
intermittently cut the darkness.

Jimmy's lost in his own world.

We still hear the song.

A car drives by and splashes a puddle all over Jimmy.

JIMMY
Fuck -

 

{looks down at his
wet clothes)
Fuck fuck fuck fuck —

Alex cracks up. Jimmy throws a fit.

Which make Alex laugh even harder.

We hear the song.

He looks at her laughing, pulls away the umbrella and jumns
into a puddle, splashing Alex.

She's soaked. Kicks water right back at him.
We hear the song.

They make their way down the street jumping and kicking water
back E forth at each other...

And Jimmy starts singin' in the rain, just singin' in the
rain. Showing off for Alex. Trying to impress her.
Singing along to the song.

Splashing in puddles. Playing with the umbrella.

43.

Singin‘ and dancin' in the rain, just sampling some old
fucking movie.

Jimmy finishes the song just as the bus pulls up.
They run to make it, drenched and laughing.

35.

Jimmy and Alex on the crowded bus. Standing UP. PaCkEd tight.
Dripping wet. and cold.
ALEX
{leans into him)
— I hate the bus. ya know, it's such
a drag. Makes me look like a loser.
But I'm saving up my money so —

Swinging back a forth, Alex grabs onto Jimmy for support.
She shivers a bit. Turning him on. He shoves his hands into
his pockets, covering. Excited riding the bus.

JIMMY
~ How was work?

ALEX
Ya know. Serving tea to rich ladies
and their daughters all dressed up,
thinking they're better than me ~

Jimmy smiles. He knows.

ALEX
- And I know that look, 'cause I
used to have this 'I‘m better than
you attitude' that made me like a
real bitch. But I'm not gonna be
doing this that long ya know. I can
hardly wait to get outta this
shithole before I kill somebody -

JIMMY
(laughs)

ALEX
New York or Germany - I won this
modeling contest and this guy was

JIMMY '7
What if the guy's full a shit, yo?
Then what?

ALEX

— Hey I'm not an idiot. He's with
Elite. And I just know I wanna get

model, I'll just become an actress
or whatever -

(laughs)
— It's gotta be exciting for you —

Park sounds cool.

ALEX

JIMMY
(surprised)
- You were there?

ALEX
Yeah. Me and all my friends — They

They don't even fuckin' know me —

Alex just looks at him.
An awkward beat.

JIMMY
(trying to stay cool)
- and you heard all that shit

ALEX
Yeah.

The bus pulls over for a stop, the doors open.
Jimmy wants to go.

JIM
— This's my stop. yo.

ALEX
(looks out the window)
Nice neighborhood.

Jimmy heads out the door. In a hurry.
Hurting Alex's feelings.

JIMMY
Thanks. I‘ll see ya later, yo.

Jimmy gets off the bus in the rain. stays on the sidewalk.
Waits for it to drive away.
And then screams out. Angry. Loud.

Beat.

51.

Stacking speakers and mixers and turntables.

The other guys close in.

All hell's about to break loose and--

Bang! A gunshot!

JIMMY

S7.

42.
Inside Wink's momis house. Jimmy, Future and Cheddar Bob

make their way down some dark stairs, descending into the

fluorescent lit basement. Panelled walls, couch, card table,
shitty TV.

Sol and DJ {2 are setting up equipment- A crate of records,
a mixer, two turntables & a microphone. Wink's got his arm
around some pretty YOUNG GIRL, carrying on.

WINK

He used to be black. Now he's just

“by do you always gotta give me

Right between all the equipment (turntables & microphone]——

DJ 12
- Be careful, yo. That shit cost us

SOL

Why else you think we still livin'

Future grabs the mic and hands it to Wink.

FUTURE
You couldn't freestyle if your life

Future flips on the turntables. Puts on Michael Jackson.
'Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.'

WINK
(puts down the mic}
You're psycho, man —

FUTURE
Am I? Just ‘cause you recorded at
Paisley Park don‘t mean you any

I‘m outta here —

It's late. But Jimmy's still going home the back way.
Through the field.

Over the

Inside the trailer, Jimmy walks past the kitchen.

Early morning, behind the hotel. Jimmy's getting out of
Sol's mother's shitty car. Sol drove him to Work. Garbage
bags line the filthy alley. Sun rising. Harsh reality.
Jimmy pauses for a moment before he closes the door.

JIMMY

— Hey Sol, ya ever wonder at what

Hours later. Jimmy the bellman, finishes loading luggage
into a brand spanking new Porsche parked in front of the
hotel. Everything's SILEHI. Except we hear Jimmy rapping a
song to himself. Quiet. Simple. Poetry.

He closes the trunk and quickly looks around, never stopping
his music. Everything else still SILENT.

Jimmy slips into the sports car. Checking out the interior.
Suddenly the passenger side door swings open, SOUND crashing
back——

And Alex jumps in. holding onto her 'French maid' uniform.

Jimmy can't believe his eyes. He looks again.
She's still there.

ALEX
C'mon, let‘s get outta here -

JIMMY
Where to?

63.

ALEX
(laughs)
anyghere in this car -

She leans over to give him a kiss, all turned on. Looks up.
And stops.

ALEX
Uh—oh ~

Jhuny follows her eyes...

A chubby guest, HR. KDSKD, is standing there watching them
about to kiss in his new Porsche. Alex just laughs, gets out
of the car and heads for the hotel leaving Jimmy behind.

Jimmy quickly jumps out——

JIMMY
I can explain, Mr. Kosko — 1——
HR. KOSKO
(dismissive)
Don't. You're just a terrible

bellman -
A frantic woman, Mr. Xosko's wife, hurries up to the car.

JIMMY
(trying to stay cool)
- Your wife‘s luggage is all loaded
up. sir. will there be anything
else?

Mr. Kosko's cell phone rings.

MR. KOSKO
There's a blue suit in my room I
need dry cleaned. Do you think you
can handle that?

JIMMY
(forces a smile)
~ Yessir. Room 722, right?

17.
Jhmny, running back into the hotel. Looks for Alex. Cheddor
Bob and Paul are in the middle of an argument——

PAUL
Call me a faggot again and I'll beat
your ass -

CHEDDER'BOB
But you're gax -
PAUL
(hard)
So?

Cheddar Bob backs down.

JIMMY
(laughs)
Yo Cheddar Bob, didya see Alex come
in —
CHEDDER BOB
MC Bob.

JIMMY
Whatever. Didya see her?

Chedder Bob points down the hall.

48.

Jimmy runs down the hallway. Catches up to Alex.

64.

She's walking backwards, still holding onto her uniform.

A crooked smile pasted on her face.

ALEX
Hey. Why'd ya take off like that
yesterday?

JIMMY

- It was jus' my stop, yo.

ALEX
(impressed)
You did?
JIMMY
Yeah I did-

And then
I hadda show those Free World
motherfuckers what was up —

She turns back around. They head down the hall together.

ALEX

— Ya know we shoulda just stolen

that fucker's Porsche.

JIMMY
{laughs}

You ever steal a car before?

65.

m3
No. But I figure you have, right?
And then we coulda just taken off
for good. whatever ~

She turns down another hallway, toward the hotel's giant
kitchen. Waiters & waitresses busy coming a going.

JIMMY
Where ya goin', yo?

ALEX '
Pickin' up a little somethin‘ for
tonight, 'yo' —

49.

In the kitchen. Busy & bright. Alex walks up to a thin
white prep cook, pulls him aside to the corner and whispers
into his ear. Jimmy talks to the other prep cook, CLIO, a
Cool black chick. A cheap boom box whines in the background.

JIMMY
— Clio, can you make me a hamburger?

CLIO
Sure thing. Rabbit

Alex makes her way over, slipping some pills (E) into her
front pocket.

ALEX
~ Hey why do some people call you
Rabbit?

JIMMY
That's jus' one a my names ~

CLIO

(laughs)

'Cause he's fast - and likes to fuck
a lot.

ALEX
Yeah?

JIMMY
- Yeah.

Alex smiles.
CLIO

Tell ya what, Rabbit — I'll battle
ya for the hamburger -

66.

Some of the other kitchen help overhear. Get excited.
Jnnuy notices. Unsure.

JIMMY
Oh I dunno -

ALEX
(pushes him)
C‘mon, 'Rabbit' —

Jimmy looks at her. He cares what she says.

JIMMY
A'ight, a'ight -

Some of the other cooks and dishwashers pipe in.

A couple of 'em start banging on the counters getting
a beat together.

Gathering around Jimmy and Clio.

And Clio goes first, battling Jimmy.

Freestyling about-—

1. Jimmy being a bellman.
2. Always late.

3. And white.

She's pretty good. Finishes. Now it's Jimmy's turn.

Alex watching.
He looks at her.

Opens his mouth to spit and

he goes off, freestyling like mad.

He‘s fast and clear.

Words flowing, focused, kicking Clio's ass.
Showing off in front of Alex.

He finishes. The kitchen goes crazy. He looks over to Alex.
And she's hot. In love.

By now, more waiters & waitresses are hanging around getting
into it, clapping, dancing. Someone turns up the boom box,
more music. Can anyone say 'Hot Lunch' — shit, we're
sampling 'PAHE.‘

A teenage PUERTO-RICAN DISHWASHER jumps in to battle Jimm
Everybody clapping and moving, whooping and hollering.
Music everywhere.

Jiumy battles the dishwasher.
Back & forth.
The rhymes flow.

It's all good.

57.

SD- .
Jﬂmny E Alex leave the kitchen. She's exhilarated.
He's wolfing down his hamburger.

ALEX
That was,-— Ya know, that was
amazing -

Jimmy smiles as they head down the hall, a bounce in his step.

ALEX
~ You‘re definitely gonna make it.
Not like all those losers back there.

JIMMY
They're not really losers, yo -

ALEX
They're not recording with Prince -

JIMMY
(between bites)
I should probably get back to work
an' shit -

- ALEX
No I think me a you should-—

Alex sees the older woman we saw training her the other day,
the tea director, her boss. heading their way.

ALEX
Shit. There's my boss, I'm late —
C'mon -

She grabs Jimmy's free hand, turns around and takes off
running in the opposite direction-—

Running together, Jimmy still with a mouthful of hamburger.
running dOWD the hall.

They turn down another hallway, hauling ass and see--
Mr. Springer getting off an elevator.
They screech to a stop. '

Searching for an esv'pe route, nowhere left to run.

Or hide. Caught between two authority figures.

Mr- Springer sees them, waves and.heads in their direction.
Alex checks around for her boss- Jimmy stuck with a mouthful
of food- Chews hard, fast to swallow.

Hr. Springer getting closer.

Jimmy doesn't know what to do with the hamburger in his hand.
Puts it behind his back.

68.

Hr. Springer Walks up- And Jimmy stuffs the sandwich into
his back pocket.

HR. SPRINGER
Mr. Smith, Miss Latourno —

ALEX
Hey, Mr. Springer -

Jimmy smiles, swallowing the last of his food.

HR. SPRINGER
(to Jimmy]
I just wanted to say, Mr. Smith,
you‘ve been doing a much better

job -

JIMMY
- thanks. So how 'bout those extra
shifts?

Alex catches a glimpse of her boss turning the corner.

ALEX
(so innocent}
Excuse me, Mr. Springer — But I
gotta go change for work. I don't
ya know wanna be late —

MR. SPRINGER
And where are you going, Mr. Smith?

JIMMY

I'm running an errand for a guest,
sir.

MR. SPRINGER
(looks at both of
them]

Okay. Well, get to work -

They walk slowly away from Mr. springer, Jimmy keeping his
hands behind his ass covering the hamburger in his pocket.
They round the next corner, then take off running again--

Down the hall. Take a turn.
Up to another bank or elevators.

They jump into an open elevator. just as the doors close.

51.

In the elevator, Jimmy a Alex catching their breath.
It's empty.

69.

They look at each other and start laughing.
Their eyes meet-

Still out of breath.

JIMMY
(crooked smile}
— what do you think we should do now?

ALEX
What do you think we should do?

He leans in closer. Both of them having a hard time catching
their breath. Excited, turned on.

JIMMY
You know —

ALEX

- yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah I think
you should fuck me.

He slides his hands down her pants. She moans.

They kiss, still out of breath, pulling at each other's
Clothes——

52.

Jimmy, opening the door to room 722. He pulls her inside and
they fall in on and all over each other. Breathing heavy.

He Pushes her up against the door. Pulls up her shirt.
Her face hot and red.

ALEX
(whispering)

ALEX
(slowly)

She kisses him.

ALEX

She moans.

And he fucks her, banging against the door in rhythm with
their breathing and moaning.

JIMMY
How does this feel, do you like it?

Fucking her harder.

ALEX
Yes yes yes

53.

Sitting down, against the door.
Disheveled. Happy. After sex.
He looks at her.

Both sweaty. hot a wet.

JIMMY
(stands up, pulling
up his pants)
— I gotta get back to work, yo.

ALEX
Uhuuh, Rabbit.

Before Jimmy can finish. he hears someone talking at the
door. Good ears. He motions to Alex to be quiet.

It's Mr. Kosko.

They look at each other. Shit.
Grab their clothes, hop into the closet fast.

5!.

Inside the closet. trying to stay quiet. Darkness.

They hear Mr. Kosko come into the room, arguing on the phone.
Upset.

JIMMY
(maths to Alex)
0h fuck — fuck -

Alex's eyes go wide. A naughty smile.
They can still hear Mr. Kosko babbling away on the phone.

And Alex leans over and quietly goes down on Jimmy.

CLOSE 0N JIMMY. biting onto his bottom lip.
Having to stay quiet.
It's so fucking good.

Alex's head bobbing in and out of frame.
Up a down.

55.

After work, late afternoon. Jimmy fixing his car in the
hotel parking lot. He can't stop smiling.

Future, Sol and DJ Iz hanging out.

72.

Sol's sitting on the hood of his mother's car in the middle
; of telling a story--

. SOL
I - you Won't believe what happened ta

But that's not her, that's not how

Sol jumps off the hood of the car. and starts talking to it
like it was the woman in the laundromat.

SOL
(all cool an' shit)

DJ 12
Shit. When ya gonna see 'er again?

JIMMY
— I think she's goin' to Wink's Show
tonight. Hopefully I'll see ‘er

56.

The sun goes down. Jimmy parks the newly-fixed Lincoln in
front of the drab double-wide mobile home.

Slips on his headphones.

Getting lost in his own world.

57.

Jimmy hurries into the trailer. tuning out.

Walks past the kitchen. Sees Alex and Wink hanging out
drinking cheap champagne with Stephanie.

What?
Jimmy pulls off his headphones. Horrified.

STEPHANIE

— Hey, Rabbit — C'mon in we're

cheap champagne;

She grabs Wink‘s hand. He smiles at her.
ALEX

(to Stephanie}
You call him Rabbit too?

and big ears and.he was so cute,

(to Jimmy)
Right, baby?

Jimmy turns red. turns back around. And leaves.

Jimmy, walking away from the trailer. Past.

Getting the fuck outta there.

Out toward the field.

It‘s almost

Wink runs out after him.

Catches up to him at the chain link
fence.
WINK

Jimmy pushes Wink harder up against the fence.

WINK

A long beat.

'76.

trailer. Wink follows after him.

WINK

Jimmy sees Alex heading their way.
Too late to run. Alex walks up. Looks to Rink.
Then Jimmy.

The three of them stand there for a moment.

Beat.

59.

CLOSE ON A PENCIL, scratching on a wall.

Words. Flying fast a furious.

Rhymes pouring out about all the shit Jimmy sees.

Jimmy and Lily are hanging out in her little girl room.
Stuffed animals. She's drawing. He's a giant. Both in
their own worlds. He shakes his right fist back 5 forth, in
rhythm. And quickly scribbles some more shit on the wall
above her bed, puking out his feelings.

CLOSE ON JIMMY'S FACE. closing his eyes. We hear the song
he's working on. Opens his eyes...

The trailer park is LHIHBTED. Back to the Adventures of
SuperJimny by R. Crumb. Ee flies out the window. rapping the
song. flying up over dirty Detroit, heading for the Shelter.
the place where he cartoon kills. Storms into the club, sees

Running through the club. hychety-Splyt grabs ale: hostage.

It's a standoff.

SUPﬂrﬂiIIQ’nnkes eye contact Iith Prince. They exchange

A super duet. -

The Free World can't help themselves. The song's too good.
Getting into the heat. Bouncing. Papa Doc lowers the gun--

1nd SuperJinny rushes then. Beating the: all to the ground.
Prince jumps in and helps out.

They beat the shit out of tha tree World. Blood everywhere.
And SuperJinny grabs Alex. rescuing her. Taking her away.
They fly out the door and into the dark alley.

She can't keep her hands o££ of him, kissing him.

Pulling at his costume.

He pulls oft her shirt and yanks down her animated jeans and
starts fucking her up against the wall, super fast and super
hard--

Suddenly we hear someone shout out--

GREG {V0}
You are such a fucking LOSER!

60.

CLOSE ON JIMMY. startled awake. BACK TO REALITY (film!.
The next day. He‘s under a blanket, on the ratty couch.
Greg and Stephanie are in the middle of a fight——

GREG

Jimmy sits up.

JIMMY

She goes to calm Lily down.

GREG
— with two homeless fucking kids.

JIMMY
(flips him off}
Fuck you. I'm outta here ~

61.

Grey skies. Storm clouds overhead.

Jimmy walks up to Wink's mother‘s house. Still wired.
Looks inside the big picture window.

Hink's passed out on the couch, the TV blaring.

62.
Wink and Jimmy descending into the basement. Wink's still
half asleep. It‘s dark down there.

WINK
- It went good last night - that
shit was sold out — but they ain't
as good as you, Bunny -

JIMMY
— did Alex like it?

WINK
Yeah. A 111' bit, ya know — but she

JIMMY
Sol's mom's droppin' 'em all off an'

Wink turns on the light. The equipment's still all set up.

WINK
Even Future?

JIMMY
Yeah. Why?

The doorbell rings.

He's killin‘ you, yo. Runnin‘ your

Wink runs back up the stairs, leaving Jimmy behind.

Starts pacing the room...

Getting more and more agitated.

He sees the photographs of wink & Prince on top of DJ 12's
records. Picks one up. Hears the guys upstairs.

SOL (OS)
Where's your mom. dawg?

WINK {GS}
Workin' -

wink leads Sol, DJ 12 and Future down the stairs.
Jimmy stuffs the photograph into his front pocket.
As soon as he sees Future. Jimmy speaks up.

JIMMY
(angry!
— yo did you fucking sign me up to

FUTURE

JIMMY

82.

Jisum'picks up one of the records and wings it at Future--
He ducks. It misses.

Jisnw'walks up in his face.

JIMMY
Fuck the other night. I'm fuckin'

Jimmy pushes him.

JIMMY

Future looks at him.
Turns and walks away.

FUTURE
Do whatever the fuck ya want, man ~
(laughs)

Future leaves.

The guys all just stand there.
That was heavy.

Beat.

SOL
Shit.

DJ 12
What are we gonna do now?

' WINK
I wanna go get high —

JIMMY
{turns away}
— No let's do some Euckin' work.

Kick into HIGH SPEED, as the guys start making music.

We
hear some song play over--

83.

63.

E165 SPEED. Writing lyrics hack & forth fucking around in
the make—shift basement studio bouncing beats and hooks and
shit all off each other bobbing their heads together getting
it right all perfectly choreographed like a dance or a

symphony running faster 5 faster until they're all just a
blur of nonwstop music.

Suddenly Wink jumps in the middle of it all.
Puts up his hands. Stop. Stop.

STOP-- Jump to assault spam.

The song ends.

JIMMY
What?

WINK
Al jus' called from work. yo - She
needs a ride to this photographer I

JIMMY

- Does she want me to pick 'er up?
WINK

I dunno.
SOL

Can we COme?

64.

It's gonna rain soon- Jimmy and Wink sit in the front seat
of the car parked at the hotel. Chedder Bob's ducking
through the rear window, dressed in his hellman's uniform,
rapping for Sol a DJ 12. He sucks.

Wink leans over to Jimmy, who's keeping an eye out the window
for Alex. Pidgety. Embarrassed.

WINK
You comin' to 96.3?
JIMMY
(distracted)
Yeah -
WINK

Cool. But the radio DJ was at the
show last night an' she invited Papa
Doc & Lyckety-Splyt up. So ya know
they might be there.

84.

JIMMY
(sees Alex leaving
the hotel)
Puckit then -

WINK
(defensive)
Yo there was nuthin' I could do
about it, B a

Before Jinnw'can respond Alex walks up to the car, holding
onto a garment bag. All the guys quiet down.

CHEDDER BOB
- Gotta go, homes. Ya know ya can't
leave old Earl all alone for long.

Chedder Bob hustles back to the hotel. Wink pops out oi the
car, letting Alex into the front seat. Then sits right back
down next to her.

Jimmy throws him a look.
It starts to rain.

65.

Rain spits. Jimmy, driving next to Alex and Wink. He can't
even look at her. Doesn't know what to say. Music low.
Alex lights up a cigarette, excited. Sol and DJ Iz lean in.
She‘s the center of attention——

ALEX
— I saw this model on a TV show and
she was sayin' that looks alone
don't mean anything if you don't
have confidence and self—esteem. Ya
know like a confidence in yourself
that you're you and everything.

Jimmy finally looks at her. And Rink smiles.

“INK
Yeah, Al. And this guy's gonna help
you do that.

“LEI

(to Wink: excited)
— yeah I just wish I had more time
to ya know,-- I mean if I had known
it was today I wouldn't have gone
out drinkin' last night —

wink turns up the stereo, making sure it‘s on 95.3.

edge)

SOL

Alex laughs. Jimmy‘s still uncomfortable.

JIMMY
(to Sol s DJ I2)

Anybody famous?

WINK
(points out the
window}
Hey it‘s right OVEI here. B —

"as.

66. ',

Still spitting rain. Downtown Detroit. bleak industrial
buildings- Fog. Lonely 5 blue. Alex crossing the street to
a run-down warehouse, leaving the guys behind in the car.

Jimmy jumps out and catches up to her.

J IHHY
— Is everything okay?

Alex doesn't stop walking.

ALEX
With what?
JIMMY
Us -
ALEX
(without skipping a
heat; cold]

Yeah. But I really gotta go —
They walk together-

JIMMY
You want me to come up —

ALEX
No that's okay.

JIMMY
- You sure everything's okay?

ALEX
I‘m justa little hungover from last
night or whatever and ya know I'm
worried that I won't photograph
good. This is really important to
me - Okay?

Jimmy stops.
And she just keeps walking up to the building.

J IHMY
(calls out after her]
Am I gonna see you later?

ALEX
You goin' to the radio station?

JIMMY
- No.

37.

ALE! .
(not listening}
Okay. I'll see ya later then -
maybe we can talk about goin' to see
Prince next week.

He stands there, watching her go. And we hear a some kinda
' remake of THE WHD's 'Love Reign O'er He.‘

67.

The sun dies in the sky. Jinnw'standing in the drizzle. out
in the fog covered field next to the trailer park.
Headphones on. white out. You can't see any trash.

It's almost beautiful. Otherworldly. And SILENT.

All we hear is 'Love Reign O'er Me' in Jimmy's head.

Jirnq closes his eyes and screams.
But we don't hear it, only the song.
He screams loud and long.

Screams his fucking heart out.

He opens his eyes and
sees a giant shape emerge from the fog...

It's a HORSE.

A big brown horse.
Jimmy can't believe it's real.

The horse looks at him, and then begins to graze in the field.
Another horse appears from the fog.

And then another.

And another- One of them has a blue blanket on, ‘DETROIT
MOUNTED POLICE.‘

Jimmy stands there. With the horses, snorting and pulling up
dead grass in the fog-

Jismy takes off his headphones, SOUND comes rushing in.
The song fades away. He hears police sirens off in the
distance. Jimmy walks up to the big brown horse.

It looks back up at him.

Jimmy's now face to face with the horse. The horse goes back
to grazing. Jimmy rubs its head. The police sirens getting
closer. Darkness closing in.

Jimmy just keeps patting the horse's head.
The song's playing.
The sirens wailing.

88.

68. ‘.
Later. Still wet and foggy. Jimmy walks up the trailer.
Sees his mom passed out on the front steps.

He stops. The song ends.

He looks at her for a moment.
Then puts an arm under her, struggles to help her up to her
feet. You can tell he's done this before.

STEPHANIE
(coming to; mumbles}
Greg leftme -

JIMMY

Jimmy drags his mom inside.

STEPHANIE

Jimmy, putting Stephanie down in her unmade bed. Goes to

take off her wet shoes.
She gets back up.

STEPHANIE

JIMMY

back down)
And you're better off without 'im.

I DON‘T CARE I WANT YOU OUT OF MY

She keeps pushing Jimmy out the door.

70. .
Night. Jimmy, driving in the rain. A downpour.
He turns on 96.3- They're playing Hink's song...

And it‘s terrible. Bad rhymes.
Weak voiCE.

Jimmy stares at the radio.

He shakes his head-

Can't help but laugh to himself- Future was right-
Jimmy shuts off the radio.

Suddenly the car goes black. Cuts off.
The lights. The steering wheel. The brakes. It's dead.
Again.

The Lincoln silently coasts to the side of the road.
Stops.

90.

And Jimmy just sits there-
In the dark.

JIMMY
Fuck —

71.
Jimmy. walking down the dark side of the road. Pouring rain.

Empty neighborhood.

Pouring rain.

He walks up to Hink's mother's houSe. Soaking wet.
Pears voices. Pouring rain. Takes a quick look in the
window before he heads inside.

Sees Wink on top of some naked girl.

Jimmy takes a closer look.
Pouring rain wherever he goes.

The naked girl rolls on top of wink.
It's Alex.

The girl is Alex.

Alex.

Surprising wink n Alex on the couch—-

She screams, covering herself up.

Wink pulls up his pants, gets tangled up with Alex.

RINK
Yo. E — I can-~

Jimmy grabs Wink up off the couch, and slams him onto the
ground. Starts hitting him. All that rage.
It isn't a fight. It's a beating.

Alex stands on the couch. freaking out.

ALEX
Leave him alone — STOP IT!

Jimmy pounding Wink. Over. And over. And over again.
It's loud. Wild. And out of control.
Blood splatters on Jimmy's shirt.

Alex jumps off the couch, screaming, crying.
Tries pulling Jimmy off of Wink——

ALEX
LEAVE HIM ALONE! Jost fuckin' get

Jimmy gets up, out of breath. Worked up. Looks at her.
Beat. Beat.

Beat.

Is he gonna fucking hit her?

We hear CONTROL MACHETE bang out 'Si Senior.‘
And Jimmy takes off. Running away.

73. -
Jimmy running down the dead streets of Wink's mother's
neighborhood in the cold rain. We still hear the song

pumping--
JUHP CHI:

Jimmy running, cror'es the street. Almost gets hits by a
car. slamming on its brakes. Jimmy just keeps running-—

JUMP CUT:
Running through another shitty neighborhood-—

JUMP CUT:

92.

Jhnny runs up to a plain old.house on a street called Novaro.
Falling apart porch. Lights on inside. The song blasting on
the soundtrack.

Jnnny knocks on the door, screams. Out of breath.

JIMMY
Janeane - fuckin' Janeane let me
in — I'M FUCKING SORRY — LET ME IN,

He knocks again.
Janeane cracks open the door.

JANEANE

JIMMY
_ (catching his breath)
I dunno. I was runnin' and, and
this is just where I ended up - and
I'm sorry, Janeane -
(heat)
You were right and, I'm really sorry.

She looks at him for a moment.
And shuts the door in his face.

Jimmy just stands there.

He puts his hands in his pockets. Cold. And wet.
Feels something in one of them..-

Pulls out the photograph of Wink a Prince.

And rips it up into little pieces.

ThIUWing it in the air.

Jimmy sits down on the porch steps. Out of the rain.
Exhausted.

The song finishes.

7!.

Later. Jimmy still sitting on the porch. Shivering.

And cold. The rain's letting up- The white van pulls over
in front of the house. Dented side. Stereo booming. bass
thumping. Bright lights shine in Jimmy's face.

Jimmy just sits there.

93.

Papa Doc, LC Lyckety—Splyt and the rest of the Free world
jump out of the van. They all walk up toward the porch.
Papa Doc leading the way, his hat pulled down over his eyes.

PAPA DOC

Yo wassup, man. You ready to go
down?

Jimmy gets up. Sees Alex and “ink get out of the van.
Wink's a mess. Broken nose. All bloody and shit.

Jimmy takes a few steps toward Papa Doc.

JIMMY
(never taking his
eyes off Alex)
What?

Papa and the rest of the Free World surround Ginny.
Wink makes his way over, blood all over his shirt.
Ales stays near the van.

PAPA DOC
You heard me. You ready to go?

Before Jimmy can respond. E, the white guy, hits Jimmy in the
back of the head.

Jimmy falls onto his knees.

LC LYCKETY—SPLYT
C'mon, Rabbit. get back up — Get up.

Jimmy gets up, turns around and smashes E.
Then takes a swing at Lyckety—Splyt——
Papa Doc kicks Jimmy in the balls.

_Jimmy falls onto his knees again. Papa hits him in the face.
PAPA DOC
You like talkin' shit? Huh? You

Jimmy falls to the ground. And then they're on him like

animals. Wink too. All six of 'em. Kicking him. Yelling
at him.

LC LYCKETY-SPLYT
Fuck you muthafucka!

PAPA DOC

Jimmy tries to get back up-

Alex just stands there watching. Silent.

WINK
{holding his nose;
kicking Jimmy in the
ribs)
You're gonna fuck with Wink, huh?
You don't know who you‘re fucking
with! You fucking loser -

The light inside the house goes off. It's now almost pitch
black- The front lawn lit up only by the van's bighbeams.

Jiunw'tries to get up again. Drops. Falling.
Giving up. The ground.

Going down.

Letting go.

Falling, falling.

75.
The sun rises. The rain‘s stopped.
It's a new day. The next morning. Light.

Jimmy limps up to the trailer park. His eye black.
His body heat.

Instead of running past the entrance like he always does,
Jimmy just walks right in through the front gate.
At the busy intersection.

For the whole fucking world to see.

76.

Jimmy limps into the trailer. He looks like shit. Bloody
shirt. Hurt ribs. Face a mess- Stephanie is in the
kitchen, pouring milk for Lily's cereal.

They both look up at him. Horrified.
And run to him.

STEPHANIE
Ohmygod —

LILY

Lily grabs him around the waist. Stephanie hugs him,
smothering him.

95.

Jiunw looks at her.

And busts out laughing.

Laughing. Laughing so hard he's almost crying.

71-

Later. Jimmy, making his way through a crowded bus.
There's one empty seat between two older black women.
Jinmy sits down between them.

He just sits there looking off. stuck betWeen the two Women.
We're sampling the '5:15' scene from 'QUADROPHENIA.‘
Jimmy's weary. And in pain. Riding the bus.

No fantasy. No music. No love.
Just reality.

Sitting on the bus.

Looking straight ahead.

73.

The hotel's basement locker room. Jimmy taking off his
shirt, getting ready for work. Purple black 5 blue covering
his body. Bruised ribs. Chedder Bob's standing next to him,
changing out of his uniform. Done for the day.

CHEDDER BOB
(staring at Jimmy's
bruises)
— Ya know that fuckin' bitch didn't
Show up tor work, Rabbit. I bet

CHEDDER BOB

CEEDDKR‘BOB
He tried to kill some dude who kept

CHEDDER BOB

Cheddar Bob}
What the fuck.

93.

79.

CLOSE 0N JIMMY was Hermann. working the front with Paul.

He looks over to the tea girls serving. Alex isn't there.

Classical music plays in the background.
Alex isn't there.

Fuckit- Jimmy turns back and opens the door for some guests,
forcing a smile. welcoming them to the hotel.

Hr. Springer walks up.

MR. SPRINGER
- Can I talk to you. Mr. Smith?

80.
Hr. Springer's cramped basement office. Jimmy winces when he
sits down.

MR. SPRINGER

MR. SPRINGER

81.

Later. Jimmy's leaving a room on the 7th floor with the
luggage cart. stuffing some money into his pocket. The guest
closes the door behind him. He still hear Curtis 5 Lauryn.

Jimmy walks down the hall...
Passes by room 722.

The room he fucked Alex in.
The door's open.

Jimmy stops. Takes a peek inside.

The maid is cleaning the bathroom, just out of sight.
The closet doors are all open.

Empty.

82.
CLOSE 0N JIMMY, riding the elevator.
Going down. The song plays on.

Jimmy walks outside of the hotel. Out into the cold night.
Paul's leaning against the wall waiting for a ride, checking

PAUL

JIMMY
I'm pickin' up Earl's shift —

PAUL

Crazy what happened, huh?

Paul snaps his fingers. Jimmy laughs, stands there for a
moment. You can see their breath white in the cold.
Paul offers him a drag off his cigarette.

Jimmy takes it. Smokes.

JIMMY
- Yo Paul — You ever get tired of
takin' shit from everybody, people

Hands the cigarette back to Paul.

Jimmy hustles down the street to the Shelter. Back in his
own clothes. Out of breath. In pain. There's a mob scene
out front waiting to get in. Twice the size of the last
crowd.

He passes by Sol, DJ 12 and Chedder Bob, who's drinking from
a brown paper bag.

CHEDDER BOB
(sees him; calls out)
Yo Rabbit — wait up!

Jimmy doesn't stop. Keeps on moving, heading down the dark

Jimmy walks on stage. Under the toxic glare of the lights.
People crowded along the edges. The DJ spinnin'. The big
scoreboard clocks on the wall set at 60. LC Lyckety—Splyt's
already there, standing next to Future. Shit—eating grin on
his skinny little face.

r”\

105.

We see the crowd from Jhmmy*s point of view. It's a mob
scene. Rowdy. Overflowing. Electric. People get ready.
Jimmy sees Alex hanging out with “ink [white bandage over his
DOSE). Papa Doc and the other two Free World black guys.
Everybody looking at gig.

Future smiles Jﬂmmy's way and introduces LycketY-Splyt-

'He's going first.

The DJ lays down a heat.
And LC Lyckety-Splyt‘s all over Jimmy.

Freestylin' about~-
1. Jinnw's failure in the last battle.

2. Jimmy being white.
3. Jimmy's black eye.

Jimmy just bobs his head to the beat, looking down, not
reacting to a thing Lyckety—Splyt spits.

The clocks tick down to 0. The crowd shouts.
Lyckety-Splyt laughs.

It's now Jimmy's turn. All the lights are on him. Blinding.
The Future hands him the mic.

Some people start booing.

Yell shit at him.

Booing Jimmy.

Jimmy bounces, collecting his thoughts, tuning out the world.
Not hearing it. This is it. It's just him.
The beat.

Beat.

And Jimmy just goes off—-

All the anger pouring out of every muscle in his body.
Into this moment. Forgetting about his pain.

Ginny's spitting fire.

Right up in Lyckety-Splyt's face.

Ripping into him-

Destroying him-

Cutting him.

If words could kill.

He‘s so good.

Jimmy finishes.

Beat.

And the crowd goes fucking crazy. Much louder than they were
for LC Lyckety-Splyt. Vocal. Approving. Screaming.

Jimmy won the round!
The Future laughs.

106-

hnd Jimmy just walks off stage, passing by the Big Bad Dude
from the beginning of the movie. They pound fists.
The dude knows who he is now-

88.

Jimmy makes his way through the noise and the crush, heading
toward the bathroom. He sees Alex still with Wink, Papa Doc
and the other guys.

Jinnq—and Alex make eye contact through all the bodies in
traffic.

Beat- A moment.

She smiles at him, awkward. And gives him the finger.
Flirting.

Jimmy just laughs at her. Puts on his headphones.
And walks away.

CLOSE 0N JIMMY, walking away. Laughing.
Never looking back.
Holding his head up. black eye and all.

Later. Jimmy. battling E on stage.
In a zone. Fast. Plowing.

The crowd fucking loves it.

He exchanges pounds with Future, who takes the mic and hands
it to E.

E's up.

Starts freestyling--

And Jimmy'sits down on the stage.

CLOSE 0N JIMMY, just sitting there. Quiet. Looking out at
all the people. Ignoring E's rap. Not hearing it.

Not listening- not caring. We stay on Jimmy the whole time.

B finishes. Scattered applause. Jimmy won again.

Jimmy gets up, walks off.

FUTURE
(pushes Chedder Bob}
Yo ~ shutthefuckup, fool!

90.

The finals. The crowd's in a frenzy.
Jimmy vs. Papa Doc.

Both of them on stage-

Neither one looking at the other.
The showdown.

This is it.

Future hypes the championship.

FUTURE

round, for the right to take my
place as host on 311 the open mic

arm;

n.-

103.

CLOSE 0N JIMMY, head already down. Staring at the floor.
Lost in his own world. Total concentration on his face.

He hears Future finish. Jimmy looks back up.
People scream. shout. Ready for blood.

And Future introduces him.

Jiumy's up first-

The DJ lays down the beat-..

And Jimmy pauses.

He stares at Papa Doc-
Long-

And hard-

Suddenly a smile comes to Jimmy's face. A shining sun.
Beat.

And Jimmy freestyles about himself, from his side—-

1. About not going to Paisley Park - how it's not real.

2. About getting his ass kicked - by 6 guys.

3- About Wink fucking Alex — and how she blew him in a closet.

 

About all the bullshit.

Making fun of it all.

Taking away all of Papa Doc's material.
And turning it back on himself.

He's a genius.

Letting everybody know he just doesn't give a fuck.
About anything.
He's found his true voice.

He kills. Finishes.

JIMMY
(yells out at the
audience, giving
them all the finger)
Fuck you - You dunno who I am?
I know who I am u

The crowd goes nuts. Bouncing off the walls. High-fiving
and screaming joy. All born again.

Future can't stop laughing. He hands the mic to Papa Doc.

Papa Doc just Stanis there. The beat goes on.
The crowd still wild over Jimmy.

And Papa Doc just stands there.
Stares out at the crowd.
Freezes.

He's got nothing.

He knows he's already beat.

109.

It's over.

91.

The lights come up. Night over. Jimmy and his friends walk
through the crowd. They're jumping up 8 down all around him,

so excited. Shouting his name out loudr laughing. barking,
'E-RABEIT! B-RABBIT! B-RABBIT!’

Everybody else reaching out wanting to congratulate Jimmy,
tell him how good he is, loving him, basking in his glow.

Jhnny just keeps walking out. Not getting caught up in it
all.

92.

The crowd flowing out of the club. Hanging outside.

Freezing. Buzzing. Jimnw'and his crew make their way
through all the people.

CHEDDER BOB

DJ 12

SOL

Beat.
5' JIMMY

Fuckit, man — I gotta run.

,.-"‘~‘

111.

Jhnny says goodbye to the Future, and takes off running down
the street. On his own.

Away from his friends.

Away from the crowd.

Away from the club.

Running by himself down the dirty streets of Detroit.
Heading in the opposite direction of everybody else.
Sweet wind licks his face. Cold breath slips his mouth.
He hear our closing credit song.

and the scene beings to LHIllrE.
But this tine he isn't a superhero flying up in the sky-
This time he's just plain Jimmy. Running.

.1 little smile comes to Jimmy's face.
He runs, feet solid on the ground.
Faster.

Lighter.

Free.

He runs, Jimmy runs.
