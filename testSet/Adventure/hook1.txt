You’ll want to be looking your best.

WENDY
I was just tidying up my memory, Liza.

my life muting at thiam-

Her gentle voice still wistful, but regal; aged with grace.

WENDY

Your father worries.too much about
a great too many things.-

(remembering)
Of course when I first met him, he
couldn't read a word. He didn’t
even know his name, or who his Mummy
and Daddy were. Just a poor little
orphan boy--he was.

, MAGGIE
Is that why he grew up to be a lawyer?

GRANNY WENDY
(girlish laughter)
Your father used to be a very wild and
rambunctious child, believe it or not.

Jack perks up at the window, suddenly interested.

. JACK
I don't believe it.

GRANNY WENDY
.It's true, Jack. He reminded me so
.much of the little boy from Neverland,
I called him "Peter". Your grandparents
adopted him with that name and moved to
to the States. What a wild mischieveous
child he was--so full of life.

She trails off lost in the memory.

What would you name him now?
She visibly flinches as Peter enters decked in his tux.

PETER
Granny Wendy, what.are you doing
on the floor? Do you want to be late
to the most important event in your
life?

He helps her up. She kisses Maggie, waves to Jack and heads
for the door, perturbed at Peter's manner.

He tucks her in. She hands him a Paddington Bear sheet all
tangled with curtain cord. He inspects it--puzzled.

MAGGIE
Merry early before Christmas. It's

Thanks, Princess. It's...really...uh..

MAGGIE

better teld me before I have children

Peter marvels at the mind of his 5 year old cuddling with
her teddy bear. In 10 seconds she’s out cold. Asleep.

He moves to Jack's bed--both in need of a serious heart to
heart.

PETER
Hey-~tomorrow we'll go to the Tower
of London. What d'ya say? Have some fun.

JACK

Yeah, sure, great....

He smoothes Jack's hair. He's not connecting. Lingering in
the face of rejection, he checks the window one last time,
turns on the nightlight and finally leaves.

Peter exits,.leaving the door just ajar. Taking one final
peek--his kids are in safe in bed. He did it. Me sags
against the wall-—a deep sigh of relief. The giant burden

Peter bursts in. The room has been savagely tossed. Eeds

Moira enters. She swallows her cries. Horrified, she races
out. Her calls echoing through the house.

MOIRA
Jack? Magieee? Sweetheart?

EXT. NURSERY WINDOW - CONTINUING ACTION
Peter leans out, searching the row-yards below.

PETER

A raspy voice cackles from the night freezing Peter cold.

' VOICE

Peter freezes. There, in the garden, clinging to the top of
an old shade oak like a scared kitten is TOOTLES!

Have to save Jack! hoek's backhhh!

safety nets.

TOOTLES

Think—-happy thoughts--happy thoughts--

MOIRA pushes through the FIREMEN looking for Peter.

INSPECTOR GOOD appears before her. A pro from Scotland

GOOD
The old man wouldn't let my chaps
bring him down. He wanted your husband.

MOIRA

Peter--my god--oh shit--Peter--

WITH PETER - ASCENDING THE RESCUE LADDER

Hugging every rung, closing his eyes, afraid to lock down.
Acute vertigo. Tootles leans percariously out.

PETER
(terrified whisper)
Easy, Toots. Take it easy.

TOOTLES LUNGES, clutching Peter like a drowning man.

MOIRA SHOUTS! FIREMEN tighten Peter’s safetyline lowering
them to the ground.

PETER AND‘TOOTLES - DESCENDING
Tears stream down Tootles craggy face. Bravado gone.

TOOTLES
I forgot...how to f1y...We all forget
when we grow up....All forget...

PETER
Tootles? What happened? Where are
Jack and Maggie? Keep talking, okay?

They touCh down. Tootles subsides, catatonic again. MEDICS
sit him down in a chair checking his Vitals.

Peter pities the crazy old man at the end of his life.
Inspector Good shakes his head in sympathy.

Moira rushes to Peter--both shell shocked.

MOIRA ,

But she refuses to go to the hospital.

The Doctor indicates they should go. Peter guides Moira

They’re alone. Wendy points to the ragged copy of Petera

She caresses his hand tenderly, adopting the motions and
voice of "Wendy the girl".

WENDY

PETER
You just....relax. I’ll get her.

He pats her hands. "Wendy" presses his to her heart--

WENDY
Np--hg I have tried so many times to
tell you--

(clutching the book)
The stories here are true. Tootles
grew up just like you. He went crazy
trying not to. He never forgot-—

(she drifts, losing it)

...You forgot phe child inside yep.
You gave up immortality in one world
for the pain and joy of life ehg death

has come to seek revenge..

She turns the book to him--pleading--willing him to see.

Peter stares at_it, stonefaced. He looks back to Gran.
She's sound asleep. Out cold.

CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Peter exits Granny Wendy's bedroom, exhausted. Moira is
waiting, running on fumes.

MOIRA
What did she say?

Peter embraces her, holding her tight, trying to make it
all go away--but it won't.

PETER
Nothing....She fell asleep again.

She searches his face--hoping, praying. The Doctor enters
the bedroom. Moira follows.

He pours a double scotch and chugs it. He pours another.

CUT TO:
INT. DINING ROOM.- LATER

Peter and Moira sit on a sofa. Catatonic. Waiting. Waiting.
Inspector Good appears in the door.

PETER

Inspector---

Moira wipes her eyes trying to make herself presentable.

GOOD
Mr. and Mrs. Bannning--The old gent
checks out. We've wired the phones.

2 of my boys will be outside. The lab
chaps will analyze this--

He holds up the dagger and note. Moira can't look at it.
"DEAR PETER, WELCOME HOME...CAPT. JAS. HOOK"

GOOD
It's entirely possible it's all some
. kind of ridiculous prank--giVen the
. family literary history and what all—-

Moira and Peter don't want to hear this.

. GOOD -
We can only wait and hope, I’m afraid.
I am deeply sorry for you both. I assure
you, Scotland Yard will do everything
we can to find your children. G'night.

He tips his hat to Moira--nods to Peter and leaves.

Moira, numb, begins to tidy up--trying not to think. GLASS
CRASHES to the flOor startling them both.

Moira disentegrates in tears. Finally letting go.

A SHIP IN A BOTTLE lays in pieces on the floor. Peter picks
it up--transfixed. A BRIGANTINE! The ultimate Pirate ship!

Dead silence. A near empty Scotch bottle sits next to it.
Peter picks the bottle up, still in tux pants, suspenders
down, now wearing a golf shirt and sneakers. Strung out.

INT. GRANNY WENDY’S BEDROOM - LATER

Peter peeks in. Moira sleeps in a chair beside the bed,
holding Granny Wendy's hand. Gran is out cold.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

Tootles is now curled asleep on a loveseat, clutching
Maggie’s teddy hear. The saddest face ever. Youth gone.
Waiting to die. Hopeless.

INT. NURSERY - LATER

The door slowly opens. Peter braces himself in it--facing
the dark empty lifeless room. He hoists the near empty
bottle for another pull.

PETER ,
(drunken slur)
Hi kids, don'forget to brush...teeth.

He fumbles Maggie's parachute off the floor and staggers to
the window. He opens the sash, swinging the windows back
and sits down on the seat. He looks up into the starry
sky--as it to make a wish. Closing his eyes tight, he
breaks down. Sobbing openly. A MYSTICAL BREEZE kicks up
dancing the curtains. He looks again. _

PETER’S POV - FRAMED BY THE WINDOW - THE SKY

He tries to focus through his enebriated state.

The dollhouse--capsized on the floor like a mini-earth
quake. TINK LAYS SPRAWLED under a tiny sofa--doing her best
Miss Scarlett. Her light flickering weak.

She sneaks a peek as Peter wobbles to her.

Oh my God--I think I killed it.

Okay--I'm clapping. Just stop ringing--

You didn't really mean it. And HE'-

Seething, she poses her mini-body next to Maggie's Barbie

’ doll. Seeing the competition, Tink rips Barbie’s head off.

PETER
I've had enough of this crap, faerie.

He heads for the door, rubbing his temples. TINK SWIRLS
AROUND HIM checking him out like a mad doctor--teeth,
throat-~flab on his belly--

TINK
You used to call me "Tink"--You never
talked "ca-ca". Look at you. You're

You're really out of shape. What are

Look at those buns. How do you expect
to fly with those? You used to have
great buns. Ahhhh. 29g shavgl???

Tink shrinks back in horror.

_See--I'm net Peter Pan!

Tink releases him, checking her nails in the moonlight.

TINK
Oh--fine then who's going to fight
Captain ﬂock in the ultimate duel
between good and evil and save you;

Peter sobers for a milliseconds-staring hard at the faerie
before him, trying desperately to get her in focus.

Tink coaxes him out on the ledge. He’s very shakey, tangled
in Maggie's parachute.

TINK
We don't have rides in Neverland.
Grownups don't believe it exists.
It's a "stage" or a "syndrome" or
a "delusion with no sensory or ob-

Adults just seal: 292.. Let’s fly.

You forgot that too. Just close your

He loses his balance-~AND FALLS OFF THE LEDGE!

PETER PLUMMETS AT US! Yelling. The little shower ring fixed
to the harness fapping him in the face. He YANKS IT!

THE GROUND RUSHES UP--PETER SNAPS TO A HALTd-hanging
limply. Bedsheet parachute open above him. He whoops. It

DESCENDS right to his face. No vital signs.

WHISPERS O.C. A grimey boy's hand checks Peter's pockets. A
tatooed Mermaid visible on the dirty forearm.

His own voice hurts his head. O.C. ANIMALS and CREATURES

cinches his left foot jerking him UPSIDE DOWN into the air.

coming to grips with the truth.

Do you know where we are?

He nods--unable to make himself say it.

TINK
Who am I?

PETER
(fogged in, trying to reason)
You're just...a composite of all the
girls and women I thought I was in
1 love with in my life--And I'm under
anaesthesia right now for brain surgery.
(seizing up, defenses failing)

TINK
Say it, Peter. Say it.

PETER
Or ye§;;e geal....."Tinkerbell".

(elated to hear him say it)
Pleased to meet you. Whe are you?

PETER
(taking in the panorama)
I just can’t accept this. It’s not
rational adult thinking. I can't
believe this is...possible.

Children‘believe.

Tink wraps his cut hand with his handkerchief.

That's right. Jack and Maggie are here.

CANNONS ROAR O.C. echoing across the island. Peter scans
the cove, searching.

PETER
That’s an 18 pounder—-124 foot hull.
She can do 14 knots under full sail.
46 galley cars for ramming speed. 35

CUT TO:
EXT. PIRATE TOWN SQUARE - DAY

A guillotine juts into the sky. Blade gleaming. It drops
with a rush. WE HEAR the sickening sound of contact O.C.

SMEE catches two cleanly severed halves of a watermelon
placed in the guillotine headblock. A small bowling ball of
a man, with John Lennon glasses and wirey hair bulging from
under his hat, eats ravenously, SPITTING SEEDS---

06/21/90 40

--AT A LINE OF SLAVES carrying supplies to a LAUNCH at the
dock. Most are KIDS. The rest--MALAYSIAN & SOUTH AMERICAN
INDIANS. BILL JUKES, a big African Pirate tatooed all over,
CRACKS a mean whip, driving the slaves hard.

EXT. EDGE OF PIRATE TOWN - DAY

Peter appears down the path. He slows at the sights and the
mass of Pirates. The urgency of battle preparations can be
seen everywhere. -

Peter heads into the square like he’s going to the bank.
TINK YANKS his suspenders pulling him back out of sight.

EXT. OUTBUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION
Peter lands against a pile of mangos. Tink's in a snit.

TINK ‘
Where do you think you're going?'
Are all adults as dumb as you? Do
you want to talk to Hook? Do you?
Or see your kids? Get a grip Peter.
-All those Pirates are getting ready
for your arrival...the "Great Pan".

She looks him up and down, disgusted--

TINK

And look at you. Xgu've get e little
horsey eg your shirt!
(pulling the "logo" on his
golf shirt) _
‘ You’ll get 2 feet in that outfit.

,’ PETER . 3
I've had just about enough of this. ’ ‘
\

Peter dusts his "horsey", smoothes his hair and disappears'
around the corner. Tink leans against the wall, checking
her nails, cursing in faerie speak. gee eeggng later--
PETER DIGS BACK AROUND THE CORNER

Running for his life--A 31c UGLY PIRATE right behind,
slashing air with his wide cutlass.

TINK lets Peter pass. Non-plussed, she sticks her dainty
foot out directly in the path of the Pirate-~HE TRIPS!

TINK SNATCHES HIS HAT. He SNACKS headon into a brick wall.

CUT TO:

06/21/90 - 41

EXT. OUTBUILDING - MINUTES LATER

"PETER THE PIRATE" peeks around the corner. Wearing the
Pirate’ s outfit. Even the eyepatch. TINK PEEKS from the
brim of the Pirate’ s hat.

TINK
You look good.

PETER
I look stupid. Where do we go?

Tink points toward the docks.
_FOLLOW PETER & TINK [IN HIS HAT]
Into the throng headed toward a launch at the dock.

TINK
Loosen up. Swagger.

He's, stiff, uncomfortable, pulling at his pirate pants.
His eyepatch causing him to bump into Pirates and things.

PIRATES SHARPEN CUTLASSES on sparking grist stones and
STACK MUSKETS on racks.

MORE DRINK FLAMING RUM. One Pirate's face catches on fire.
Others laugh and point.

Peter takes in the 30 foot long STUFFED CROCODILE hanging
above a sleazy bar aptly named "LE CROC". The remains of a
HUMAN RIGHT HAND stuck in its JAWS. So that's what happened
to the Ticking Croc.

They reach the dock. SLAVES HOIST NEW CANNON onto "Gigs"
[small launches] at the pier. SLAVES ROLL BARRELS on deck
under Bill Juke's whip.

PETER
(horrified)
They're just children.

TINK
Hook's a scummy slaver. He makes a
fortune selling Lost Kids and Indians.

Peter reacts. Any of them could be his children. He marches
up the gangway onto the launch.

THE VIEW CLIMBS: REVEALING: HOOK’S SLEEK DARK BRIG

At anchor in the Cove. "A rakish looking craft foul to the
hull". 2 bodies swing from the bowsprit.

VOICES ROAR from the ship like a football game.

The cadaverous pirate holding the hour glass in one hand
and a bloody heart in the other. CHANTING GROWS LOUDERr-

EXT. HOOK’S SHIP - MAIN DECK - CONTINUING ACTION

Jammed with PIRATES up and down the gunwales, hanging from
riggings, filling the decks. STOMPING! CLAPPING! Just like
a Rock concert. The chant is DEAFENING.

PIRATES

INT. HOOK’S GREAT CABIN - DAY

‘Lavishly appointed. Art Treasures. His great sword hangs on

WE SEE HOOK in bits and pieces--like a puzzle being.

2 INDIAN MAIDENS comb his long raven hair which is "dressed
in long curls...like black candles, and give a singularly
threatening expression to his handsome countenance".

EXT. DECK - PETER CLIMBS ABOARD

With other Pirates from the launch. He is overwhelmed. Tink
gets a bird's eye view riding in Peter's hat.

, , PIRATES
HOOK! HOOK! HOOK! HOOK! HOOK!

INTERCUT: HOOK AND PETER

HOOK: A sash of gold and scabbard of silver and emeralds is
belted on. His cruel gleaming seductive sword sliding
erotically into it. Fingers smooth his thin moustache. Two
cigars glow in his double holder.

PETER: A stadium-style PIRATE WAVE starts at the bow
rippling toward him—-He watches it go by to the stern and
back up the other side.

06/21/90 43

TINK ‘
Why did I let you talk me into this?

Tink plugs her ears trying to make the noise stop.

HOOK: One Maiden proffers the velvet gentleman's box
displaying all the cruel prosthetics and implements. Hook
chooses--his voice educated....serpentine.

HOOK
Platinum. Elegant understatement
with just the right touch of excess.

Hook inserts the platinum claw with a decisive CLICK. His
back to us, he dons his broad black hat.

HOOK’S GLEAMING BLACK BOOTS ASCEND STAIRS TO:
EXT. QUARTER DECK - SMEE APPEARS FIRST

SMEE

CANNONS FIRE one after another!
THE GREAT CABIN DOORS FLING OPEN

THE HOOK FLASHES in the bright sun. A CHEER ERUPTS like
nothing heard since "Lawrence of Arabia and "Ben Hur".

REVEAL: CAPTAIN HOOK! In all his evil splendor. A SEES:
eterl Parading the quarter deck for all to envy and lust.
Barrie describes the famed Captain perfectly.

"In the midst of them, the blackest and largest
jewel in the setting...James Hook, or as he wrote
himself, Jas. Hook....In person he was cadaverous
and b1ackavized...His eyes were of the blue of the
forget-me-not, and of profound melancholy, save when
he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two
red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly."

Hook limbers up with his lethal sword.

 

 

06/21/90 _ 44

HOOK

(to himself, sardonic)
Behold my multitudes of ignorant
flotsam. There' s not brains enough
among you to count successfully from
1 to 2. My body waste inspires more
allegiance than the lot of you.
I am marooned. Where are you, Pan?
Oh the eternal hell I endure for
fame, that glittering bauble...

...Itismins-

Hook bows, a matinee idol taking a curtain call.

TINK leans down from the hat right in Peter's face. She
doesn't like what she sees.

TINK
Let's go. Now. Okay? Can we go now?

PETER, eyes wide; heart in his throat. His jaw limp.
HOOK MOTIONS for "silence"..He gets it. A

HOOK

(loud for all to hear)
My loyal, courageous, inferior crew.

years with you parisitic scum. At last--

SMEE hoists PETER PAN in effigy on a pole. PIRATES CHEER.
HOOK silences them with a "look". '

HOOK
At last-—the ultimate duel between--

A BACKING COUGH O.C., stops Hook in mid-gesture. Uh oh.

HOOK
, (starting again)
The ultimate duel between--
(coughing interrupts again)
The ult--

The HACKING COUGH gets worse. Pirates draw in their
collective breath. HOOK DESCENDS the steps to the BIG

COUGHING PIRATE-- whipping his fine silk handkerchief from

his sleeve--offering it. The poor man reaches for it--

\Jj

06/21/90 . 45

COUGHING PIRATE
Thanky, kindly, Cap'n---

Hook let’s it drop. The Man bends to fetch it. Hook's EYES
GLOW RED. He RAMS HIS HOOK into the man’s gut.

HOOK
(sadistic mirth)
--God bless you---[Gedzundteit]

The bloodthirsty CREW goes berserk as Hook HOISTS the man
high on his claw and HURLS HIM overboard.

BELOW, SHARKS churn the waters, feasting.
PETER hangs on the gunwale badly shaken. TINK TUGS him--

TINK
Seen enough? Let's get out of here.

PETER
Wait....Not yet......

HOOK "AHEMS" quietly. The hubbub stops instantly.

HOOK
Now-~where were we? Ah--"u1timate
duel between good and evil"....
Dark and light? Handsome and ugly--
(to himself--to Smee)

Hook vs. 2a 3 to the death! AND WHO
SHALL WIN?

GOOD-~GOOD--GGG!!!!

 

06/21/90 ' 46

Hook wheels his gleaming blade reared to strike.

HOOK
SMEEEEE?

SMEE
Good..in an evil sort of way, Captain.

 

Hook only tweaks Smee's nose with the blade. Relief.

HOOK
Once I have rid the world of Pan, I
shall leave this place forever. And
seek adventure where...a man of my
intellect and talent is...appreciated.

He pauses dramatically milking the moment.

HOOK
Who sails with Captain Hook!

 

PIRATES ROAR in support.

JUKES WHIPS 2 INDIAN SLAVES to open the main hatch--
PETER strains to get a better view. He is horrified.
DOWN IN THE HOLD

CHILDREN, Scores of them, chained to galley oars. The
bright sun causing them to shrink like mice. Hands
outstreteched, begging, pleading for food-—

NOODLER, a bald-headed ape of a man with his hands fixed
backwards on his huge arms, HOISTS a cargo net up from the
hold. JACK & MAGGIE hang captive inside. Terrified.
Clutching each other. Too frightened to scream.

PETERs—dying a thousand deaths--mouths their names
silently. A father-~help1ess to protect his children.

HOOK .
Let’s give a warm welcome to Jack and
Maggie Pan! Hi, kids! Isn’t this fun?!!

JACK
Let us go! We didn't do anything!

WITH PETER
PIRATES CHEER around him, firing guns, adding to his

horror. He tries to PUSH through. TINK PULLS the seat of
his pants.

Excuse me-—pardon me--coming through--

Listen to me--You can't help them yet--

Peter BATS her to the deck.

TINK DODGES BOOTS, STOMPING and KICKING her about. She
scrambles into a cannon.

PETER pushes angrily through.
PETER
(yelling for attention)
EXCUSE ME! HULLOO! CAPTAIN HOOK!
I think I’m the man you're looking for.
HOOK FACES PETER ACROSS THE DECK
"High Noon". "Gunsmoke". "7 Samurai". All heads turn.

Jack and Maggie can't believe their eyes.

 

JACK/MAGGIE
Daddy? It’s daddy--DADDYYYYYY1

PETER
Daddy's here! Everything's going to
be all right!

HOOK
(disgusted by the word)

paddy? ﬂho are youuu?
PETER
I don't know who I am anymore or
how this happened, but those are my
children and I want to take them home.

PETER SHEDS his pirate gear causing a major stir in his tux
pants, sneakers, and golf shirt.

TINK can barely make herself watch from the cannon.
HOOK regards Peter from afar.

Smee produces a leather pouch, pulling out documents.

_ ' SMEE. ‘
"Pan, P"...here we go. Adoption papers.
Sworn affidavit by one "T Belle." Uh--
medical history. Dental records. Birth
certificate. Social Security--It's all
in order, Cap' n. .

PETER
(distraught)
Can I see those?

Hook silences Peter with a look that could rot eggs. He
motions Smee to check Peter out.

Smee aproaches and pulls up Peter's golf shirt. Peter
fights his ticklish spot.

SMEE
Aye. Here's the scar. "Hypertrophic".
Right where you give it to'im, Cap'n,
during the Tiger Lily incident. He's
Pan or I've got a dead man's dingle.

HOOK
It can't be. This flabby-~flobby-—
(squinting)
Is that a little horsey on his shirt?!!

SMEE
(checking)
Aye, Cap' n. A little blue one! Cute
little thing.

Peter flushes red. Pirates laugh derisively.

Hook droops in profound dejection. Hardly the “Pan“ he
envisioned. Suddenly, Hook's old evil smile returns--

HOOK
Hah! Up to your old tricks, eh Pan?
You devil, you. Thought you could
fool ole Hook, huh? Disguise yourself,
eh? Trick Me, hah! Stand back, Scugs.
Watch out-~He’ll fly! Hah! Watch'im! Ho!

--jabbing, feinting, slicing the air, closing the gap
between them, trying to draw Peter out. Peter stands
motionless. Hook stops, annoyed.

A YOUNG TINKERBELL slides down his head. A smile. Babytalk.
Tink answers him. He understands. Giggling. Cackling.

him with langorous strokes. He's embarassed and aroused.

ANGELIKA
You're safe here, Peter. Forever...

PETER
You know who I am?

The 3 MAIDENS laugh seductively. Nodding in agreement.
ANGELIKA

.Oh, don't be silly. Everybody knows
Peter Pan.

"PETER
...1 geally gm...2eter 2a ....
.BABS

Of course you are. ﬁg should know.

UNA
We saw what happened. We saved you.
Hook's so disgusting.

ANGELIKA
Why didn’t you fly away?
PETER
I QEELS £12.
UNA
Yes you can.
PETER

No....I don’t remember how.

BABS '
Well, why didn't you fight then?

PETER

ANGELIKA
You're only old if you want to be.

BABS
You're strong. Look at those muscles.
She strokes his muscleless arms. Peter flushes. Unnerved.
PETER
I—-do work out...but I'm not the same
person I used to be. .

Babs grabs his "love handles" on both his hips--

. BABS
Ohhhh--You're perfect.

ANGELIKA
See for yourself. The waters do not lie.

'She smoothes a water surface to the stillness of glass.

ANGELIKA
The lagoon reflects what's inside
of you. What’s inside of everyone.

IN THE WATER

Staring back at Peter is a BOY-—age 12 or 13. Peter at that
age. Mischief in his eyes. Hair wild. Body lean-—muscu1ar.

He touches his face. The reflection does too. Peter slowly

grins--so does his image. He is awestruck. ,

ANGELIKA
'The child is there, Peter. You just
have to find it.

Angelika's form blurs past him KERPLOPADA! Right in the
center of the reflection. She hgs ; hgil! Babs and Una
follow-~their sleek fish-tailed forms knife into the water.

He hurries along the rock jetty in pursuit. The 3 Mermaids
cruise beside him, splashing, laughing, flirting,
displaying their incredible forms.

_ PETER
Wait? How do I find it?

UNA
(blatant solicitation)
I'd love to show you, Peter.

BABS
(flaunting her assets)
It's my turn to show him. Let me.

ANGELIKA'
The choice is Peter’s. He's a big boy.

They ogle him like a hunk at the beach. Peter, embarassed,
stops suddenly at the end of the rock. Under double
rainbows, the magnificent lagoon spreads before him.

PANORMAMA - MERHAID LAGOON - SEA MAIDENS AND MERMAIDS

Cavorting with Dolphins, leaping in review for him. Sunning
their incredible forms on the rocks raising up to see 2a .

Near the waterfall, Mermaids play a kind-of basketball with

brightly colored bubbles and giant clamshell goals at each
end visible in the spray. [right out of Barrie]

All call his name and wave---

MERMAIDS
Hi, Peter! It's Peter! He's back!

4-—chanting in high pitched dOlphin-like voices. A
CACAPHONY of the most wonderful feminine sounds--

UNA
“Come on in, Peter.

BABS
v Jump! Jump, Peter!

ANGELIKA
C'mon, Peter! We’re waiting for yog!

Peter looks around like a 12 year old kid to see if his
parents are watching. He finds us--

PETER
(naughty devilish grin)
‘I‘think...I'm having a happy_thought.

No kidding? HE LEAPS---YELLING all the way down--a_perfect
CANNONBALL into the school of adoring Mermaids.

CUT To:
EXT. KIDD COVE BEACH - SUNSET

The Lost Boy camp sits on a bluff. A tangle of haphazard
treehouses, rope ladders and underground hideouts.

A 2 masted Sloop that has seen better days rests on launch

blocks at the edge of the water. Haphazard repairs and
renovations evident. A nameplate; "THE DARK AVENGER".
